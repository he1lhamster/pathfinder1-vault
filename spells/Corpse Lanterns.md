  "This spell functions as _dancing lights_, except it summons up to four spheres of light, each of which glows a sickly pale green. These _corpse lanterns_ shed dim light in a 20-foot radius, and do not increase the light level in areas of normal light or bright light. In dim or normal light, the radiance of _corpse lanterns_ provides a strange contrast, giving all creatures in the area a -5 penalty on Stealth checks. In addition, the hue interferes with illusion (pattern) spells, giving all creatures in the illuminated area a +2 bonus on any saving throws against such spells. Unlike _dancing lights_, you may have more than one _corpse lanterns_ spell active at a time, but you may only move one set in any given round.
  Moving the _corpse lanterns_ does not require concentration.
  _Corpse lanterns_ can be made permanent on an area with a _permanency_ spell by a caster of at least 11th level for the cost of 7,500 gp."
