  "This spell functions as _object possession_, except as noted above. The possessed animated object has a number of Construction Points appropriate for its size (up to 5 CP for Gargantuan objects). Your silver cord extends to medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft./level). You can attempt to possess a construct instead of an unattended object as your first possession with this spell. If you do, this spell acts as _control_ construct, except as noted above."
