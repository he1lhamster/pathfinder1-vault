  "Favored by the spellcasters of Irrisen, this potent spell can disrupt spellcasters, topple enemies, and break even seemingly unstoppable charges. One or more giant spears of ice lance up out of the ground. Each stalagmite-like icicle affects a 5-foot square and tapers to a height of 10 feet. You may cause a number of _ice spear_s_ equal to one spear for every 4 caster levels you possess to burst from the ground. A creature that occupies a square from which a spear extends (or that is within 10 feet of the ground below) takes 2d6 points of piercing damage and 2d6 points of cold damage per square-creatures that take up more than 1 square can be hit by multiple spears if your caster level is high enough. The explosive growth can also trip foes. When the spears erupt from the ground, they attempt a combat maneuver check to trip any targets that take damage from the spears, with a total bonus equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. Each additional _ice spear_ beyond the first that strikes a single foe grants a +10 bonus on this combat maneuver check. If the check is successful, the _ice spear_s_ knock the foe prone. A successful Reflex save halves the damage and prevents the trip attempt. If you cast this spell upon an area covered with ice or snow, such as a glacier, frozen lake, or snow-covered field, the spears strike with additional force. Saves against the effect take a -2 penalty, and the spell effect gains a +4 bonus on the combat maneuver check to trip foes. _Ice spears_ created by this spell remain after they do their damage. They melt as normal depending on the surrounding environment. They no longer damage foes in their square, but can provide cover. An _ice spear_ has hardness 5 and 30 hit points."
