  "_Erase_ removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a scroll or from one or two pages of paper, parchment, or similar surfaces. With this spell, you can remove _explosive runes_,_ a _glyph of warding_, a _sepia snake sigil_,_ or an _arcane mark_, but not _illusory script_ or a _symbol_ spell. Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it. Otherwise, the chance of erasing nonmagical writing is 90%. Magic writing must be touched to be erased, and you also must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 15. A natural 1 is always a failure on this check. If you fail to erase _explosive runes_,_ a _glyph of warding_, or a _sepia snake sigil_, you accidentally activate that writing instead."
