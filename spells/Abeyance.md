  "_Abeyance_ suppresses the effects of a single curse on a creature. It does not restore any damage or drain that might have been caused by the curse. _Abeyance_ cannot suppress curses that cannot be removed by _remove curse_, but it can suppress curses such as lycanthropy that require _remove curse_ along with additional measures. An individual curse can be suppressed only once by _abeyance_, even if cast by a different caster. _Abeyance_ does not allow a creature to divest itself of cursed objects, though it can suppress a curse contracted from an object."
