  "You compel an unconscious or sleeping creature to rise and move in a half-awake state. The target creature staggers about if led or guided, but remains helpless for all other purposes.
  The subject moves at half speed and is limited to a single move action each round. It is not capable of moving at a higher rate of speed or taking actions other than movement except by magical assistance, and automatically fails any Dexterity- or Strength-based skill checks. If the creature takes any damage while _sleepwalk_ing_ it must make a new saving throw or the spell ends and the creature awakes (if it has more than 0 hit points). When the spell ends or is dismissed, the target remains unconscious and must be awoken normally. While _sleepwalk_ allows an unconscious creature to move, it does not awaken the creature, nor does it stabilize or otherwise heal them. A disabled creature that moves about while under the effects of this spell does not start dying again as a result of this movement."

 #### Description
You compel an _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_ or sleeping creature to rise and move in a half-awake state. The target creature staggers about if led or _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Guided|guided]]_, but remains _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ for all other purposes.
  The subject moves at half speed and is limited to a single move action each round. It is not capable of moving at a higher rate of speed or taking actions other than movement except by magical assistance, and automatically fails any Dexterity- or Strength-based skill checks. If the creature takes any damage while sleepwalking it must make a new saving throw or the spell ends and the creature awakes (if it has more than 0 hit points). When the spell ends or is dismissed, the target remains _unconscious_ and must be awoken normally. While _[[spells/Sleepwalk|sleepwalk]]_ allows an _unconscious_ creature to move, it does not _[[spells/Awaken|awaken]]_ the creature, nor does it stabilize or otherwise _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ them. A _[[conditions/Disabled|disabled]]_ creature that moves about while under the effects of this spell does not start _[[conditions/Dying|dying]]_ again as a result of this movement.
