  "You curse the target with the inability to sell, barter, or give away any item it owns, other than ordinary currency, for as long as the spell remains in effect. The target cannot sell, trade, drop, or give away possessions. The target can purchase items using ordinary currency but can't then sell the purchased items. The target can accept gifts from others but can't offer anything in exchange. A _curse of keeping_ can be ended by _break enchantment_, _limited _wish_, _remove curse_, _miracle_, or _wish_. _Dispel magic_ does not affect a _curse of keeping_."
