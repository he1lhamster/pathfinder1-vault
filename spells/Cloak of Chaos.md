 #### Description
A random pattern of color surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ to spells cast by lawful creatures, and causing lawful creatures that strike the subjects to become _[[conditions/Confused|confused]]_. This abjuration has four effects.
  First, each warded creature gains a +4 _[[spells/Deflection|deflection]]_ bonus to AC and a +4 _resistance_ bonus on saves. Unlike _[[spells/Protection From Law|protection from law]]_, the benefit of this spell applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by lawful creatures.
  Second, each warded creature gains _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ 25 against lawful spells and spells cast by lawful creatures.
  Third, the abjuration protects from _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_ and mental influence, just as _protection from law_ does.
  Finally, if a lawful creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is _confused_ for 1 round (Will save negates, as with the _[[spells/Confusion|confusion]]_ spell, but against the save DC of _[[spells/Cloak of Chaos|cloak of chaos]]_).
