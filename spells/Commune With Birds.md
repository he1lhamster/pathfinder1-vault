  "You utter a question in the form of a low-pitched bird call that can be heard up to a mile away, and can understand the responses given by birds in the area. Over the next 10 minutes, the birds reply as if you had asked them the question using _speak with animals_, giving you a general consensus answer to the question based on their knowledge. For example, you could ask if there is drinkable water in the area, the location of predators or other creatures, directions to a mountaintop or other natural feature, and so on, and the local bird communities would answer to the best of their ability. If there are no birds in range, the spell has no effect and you do not get a response. Any creature using _speak with animals_ (or a similar ability) who hears this bird call can understand your question, though it may not be able to reply in a way you can hear."

 #### Description
You utter a question in the form of a low-pitched bird call that can be heard up to a mile away, and can understand the responses given by birds in the area. Over the next 10 minutes, the birds reply as if you had asked them the question using _[[spells/Speak with Animals|speak with animals]]_, giving you a general consensus answer to the question based on their knowledge. For example, you could ask if there is drinkable water in the area, the location of predators or other creatures, directions to a mountaintop or other natural feature, and so on, and the local bird communities would answer to the best of their ability. If there are no birds in range, the spell has no effect and you do not get a response. Any creature using _speak with animals_ (or a similar ability) who hears this bird call can understand your question, though it may not be able to reply in a way you can hear.
