  "Any nonchaotic creature within the area of a _word of chaos_ spell suffers the following ill effects, depending on their

  The effects are cumulative and concurrent. A successful Will save reduces or eliminates these effects. Creatures affected by multiple effects make only one save and apply the result to all the effects.

  _Stunned_: The creature is stunned for 1 round. Save negates.
  _Confused_: The creature is confused for 1d10 minutes. This is a mind-affecting enchantment effect. Save reduces the confused effect to 1 round.
  _Killed_: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed. Save negates. If the save is successful, the creature instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25).
  Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nonchaotic extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the _word of chaos_ or not. The banishment effect allows a Will save (at a -4 penalty) to negate.
  Creatures whose HD exceed your caster level are unaffected by _word of chaos_."
