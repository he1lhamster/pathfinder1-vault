  "You summon a greater elemental (air, earth, fire, or water) bound in the form of a mighty chariot that moves at your command and can carry up to nine Medium creatures.
  Passengers inside are not harmed by the elemental, and can see, breathe, and act normally, suffering no environmental damage even when the elemental chariot is flying, underwater, burrowing, or using earth glide. Passengers are not otherwise protected, though the elemental chariot does provide cover like a normal chariot.
  The elemental keeps all of its statistics and abilities, except it loses its slam attacks and gains a trample attack (_Pathfinder_ _RPG Bestiary_ 305).
  When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, earth, fire, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.
  This spell is almost exclusively used by the Green Faith."
