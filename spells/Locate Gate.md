Locate _gate_ detects only spells or effects with a permanent or ongoing duration, not instantaneous effects like _dimension door_ or _teleport_. Locate _gate_ can be blocked by spells like _nondetection_, if the effect originates from a specific object or creature. However, spell effects can't likewise be warded. For example, ring _gate_s are a specific object, but a permanent _teleport_ation circle_ is not (the surface in which it's inscribed doesn't count). Locate _gate_ isn't blocked by lead, water, or other physical environmental conditions, but it is blocked by any intervening area that is dimensionally warded (such as by _dimensional lock_ or forbiddance)."

 #### Description
You sense the direction of the nearest _[[spells/Teleportation Circle|teleportation circle]]_ (permanent or with a remaining duration), _[[spells/Gate|gate]]_ spell, or other effect which magically connects two different locations (for example, an active magic item, a creature's special ability, or unique adventure location). _[[spells/Locate Gate|Locate gate]]_ detects only spells or effects with a permanent or ongoing duration, not instantaneous effects like _[[spells/Dimension Door|dimension door]]_ or teleport. _Locate gate_ can be blocked by spells like _[[spells/Nondetection|nondetection]]_, if the effect originates from a specific object or creature. However, spell effects can't likewise be warded. For example, _[[items/Wondrous Item/Ring Gates|ring gates]]_ are a specific object, but a permanent _teleportation circle_ is not (the surface in which it's inscribed doesn't count). _Locate gate_ isn't blocked by lead, water, or other physical environmental conditions, but it is blocked by any intervening area that is dimensionally warded (such as by _[[spells/Dimensional Lock|dimensional lock]]_ or _[[spells/Forbiddance|forbiddance]]_).
