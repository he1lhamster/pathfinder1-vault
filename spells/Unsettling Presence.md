 #### Description
Those in this spell's area who fail their Will saving throws harbor a faint sense of _[[spells/Paranoia|paranoia]]_ and evoke the same feeling in others for the duration of the spell. Domesticated animals (not including familiars and animal companions) don't willingly approach affected creatures unless the animal's master succeeds at a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild _[[feats/Empathy|empathy]]_ check. Affected creatures take a -4 penalty on Handle Animal, Ride, and wild _empathy_ checks against familiars, animal companions, animal cohorts, and other permanent companions provided by class abilities for the spell's duration. Anyone an affected creature interacts with must succeed at a Will save or have its initial attitude automatically worsened by one step for the spell's duration. Every time an affected creature attempts a Sense Motive check to get a hunch or detect a Bluff from another creature (or vice versa), it must succeed at a Will save or automatically assume the other party is lying or otherwise harbors ill will against it. Each time this spell causes an affected creature (or someone interacting with the affected creature) to attempt a Will saving throw, the spell's hauntlike manifestation occurs.
