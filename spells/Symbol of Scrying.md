  "This spell functions as _symbol of death_, except that, when triggered, it creates a _scrying_ sensor linked to you and centered on the symbol, even if you are on a different plane than the symbol. You are immediately aware that the symbol has been triggered if you are conscious, and are awakened from normal sleep if sleeping. The symbol does not otherwise disturb your concentration. You may observe the area through the symbol as if using a _scrying_ spell with the sensor as the target creature. Once triggered, the symbol remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.
  Unlike _symbol of death_, a symbol of _scrying_ is not considered a magical trap. Symbol of _scrying_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell by a caster of 13th level or higher for the cost of 10,000 gp."
