  "You speak out against a single creature within line of sight and turn possible allies against it by drawing upon the power of your voice and conviction. Creatures in the area who can see the _denounce_d creature must make a Will saving throw or have their starting attitude toward the _denounce_d creature worsened by two levels (see page 94 of the _Core Rulebook_). For example, creatures previously indifferent to the subject turn unfriendly.
  Diplomacy checks made to reverse the effects of _denounce_ are made at a -10 penalty."
