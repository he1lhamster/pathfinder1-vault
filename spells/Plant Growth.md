  "_Plant growth_ has different effects depending on the version chosen.
  _Overgrowth:_ This effect causes normal vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creepers, thistles, trees, vines, and so on) within long range (400 feet + 40 feet per caster level) to become thick and overgrown.
  The plants entwine to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or force a way through. Speed drops to 5 feet, or 10 feet for Large or larger creatures. The area must have brush and trees in it for this spell to take effect.

  This bonus is granted for 1 day after the casting of _plant growth._
  At your option, the area can be a 100-foot-radius circle, a 150-foot-radius semicircle, or a 200-foot-radius quarter circle.
  You may designate places within the area that are not affected.
  _Enrichment:_ This effect targets plants within a range of a halfmile, raising their potential productivity over the course of the next year to one-third above normal.
  _Plant growth_ counters _diminish plants_.
