If the caster and returned mortal are no longer present, the olethros does what she can to track both down and exact judgment-how successful she may be depends on the GM's discretion. The caster of _judgment undone_ can pause the spell's casting for up to 1 minute without causing the spell to fail. During this time, the caster does not need to concentrate on _judgment undone_ and can act normally and cast other spells without disrupting the spell, but if she does not begin casting again before this 1-minute window elapses, the spell fails. It is possible to cast _judgment undone_ without incurring the wrath of a psychopomp, but doing so requires the caster to first visit the Boneyard and seek out a powerful agent of Pharasma to gain permission to restore the petitioner to its mortal life. The details and difficulty of this task are subject to the GM's discretion, but at the very least should involve a significant expenditure of time and resources. The granting of permission to cast _judgment undone_ is an excellent reward for a quest given to a party of adventurers from a powerful psychopomp. If the PCs exceed expectations in fulfilling this quest, it's not unheard of for the psychopomp to not only grant permission for the spell's casting, but to also provide the diamonds needed for the spell's material component, information about the required focus, or even both. Worshipers of Pharasma who cast this spell without securing permission in this manner are considered to have grossly violated Pharasma's code of conduct."

 #### Description
This powerful, elaborate, and risky spell undoes Pharasma's judgment, returning a willing _[[monsters/Petitioner|petitioner]]_ to its mortal life. This spell must be cast on the plane to which the _petitioner_ was sent, and the _petitioner_ must be present for the entire casting. In addition, the caster must provide a specific object that the _petitioner_ valued deeply in its mortal life as a focus for the spell. This is different for every _petitioner_ and usually requires research to discover, although those who knew the _petitioner_ well in life can often _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ the item easily. At the completion of the spell's casting, the _petitioner_ returns to the mortal form it had as a young adult, with all of its memories and class levels (or equivalent statistics) intact. The casting of _[[spells/Judgment Undone|judgment undone]]_ is not without risk. The servants of Pharasma vigilantly watch for perversions of the order of fate and death, though it can take time for them to pinpoint disruptions when they occur. After 1d6+5 minutes from the beginning of this spell's 10-minute casting time, an olethrosB6 appears within 50 feet of the caster; this psychopomp demands the caster cease casting the spell immediately and attacks if its request is ignored. The psychopomp never attempts to _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ the _petitioner_ unless _judgment undone_ has already been successfully cast by the time the psychopomp arrives, in which case it attempts to eliminate the returned mortal as well. If the caster and returned mortal are no longer present, the olethros does what she can to track both down and exact judgment-how successful she may be depends on the GM's discretion. The caster of _judgment undone_ can pause the spell's casting for up to 1 minute without causing the spell to fail. During this time, the caster does not need to concentrate on _judgment undone_ and can act normally and cast other spells without disrupting the spell, but if she does not begin casting again before this 1-minute window elapses, the spell fails.
