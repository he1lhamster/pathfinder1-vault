  "You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any other spot within range.

You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels.

 #### Description
You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any other spot within range.

You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing _[[classes/Medium|Medium]]_ or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels.

All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.
