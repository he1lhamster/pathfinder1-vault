 #### Description
The twisted druids of the Uskwood forsook fire in ages past for the glory of Zon-Kuthon. Despite this _[[spells/Aversion|aversion]]_, these servants of Nidal know well the sting of flame, and have learned to turn it back on those that wield it. This spell creates a zone where magical fire effects twist and lash out against those who create the effects. A _[[spells/Zone of Foul Flames|zone of foul flames]]_ looks unremarkable to the casual observer, but a Perception check (DC = 20 + the caster's level) reveals a faint rippling effect in the area, as if of _[[universal monster rules/Heat|heat]]_ distortions in the air.
  Whenever a creature casts a spell with the fire descriptor or activates a magical fire effect (as from a magic item or a special attack) while that creature is located in a _zone of foul flames_, that creature takes full fire damage from the effect.
  If the effect allows a saving throw to reduce the damage, the victim may attempt the same saving throw to reduce the damage. All creatures in a _zone of foul flames_ gain a +4 circumstance bonus on all saving throws against fire effects, except for those made by a creature attempting to save against fire damage from his own magic.
