  "You curse two or more creatures to sicken and waste away while in each others' company. Each target that fails a Fortitude save becomes cursed with a wasting sickness. The disease has no onset period, and those who contracted it must attempt a second Fortitude save immediately. A target that fails this second saving throw takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage and 1d6 points of Charisma damage. Every day thereafter, each target that was within 100 feet of another target during the previous 24 hours takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage and 1d6 points of Charisma damage (reroll to determine the specific amount of damage each day). A successful Fortitude save negates the damage for that day only. A target cannot be healed of damage from this disease (naturally or by magic) while the target is within 100 feet of another target. If healed of such damage while away from other targets, a target might take damage again the day they reconvene. This disease is a curse, and can never be cured by successful saving throws. The spell can be ended on a single target only with a successful casting of _remove curse_ followed by a successful casting of _remove disease_ while the target is within 100 feet of at least one other target. When the curse remains on only one target, it ends automatically."

 #### Description
You curse two or more creatures to sicken and waste away while in each others' company. Each target that fails a Fortitude save becomes cursed with a wasting sickness. The disease has no onset period, and those who contracted it must attempt a second Fortitude save immediately. A target that fails this second saving throw takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage and 1d6 points of Charisma damage. Every day thereafter, each target that was within 100 feet of another target during the previous 24 hours takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage and 1d6 points of Charisma damage (reroll to determine the specific amount of damage each day). A successful Fortitude save negates the damage for that day only. A target cannot be healed of damage from this disease (naturally or by magic) while the target is within 100 feet of another target. If healed of such damage while away from other targets, a target might take damage again the day they reconvene. This disease is a curse, and can never be cured by successful saving throws. The spell can be ended on a single target only with a successful casting of _[[spells/Remove Curse|remove curse]]_ followed by a successful casting of _[[spells/Remove Disease|remove disease]]_ while the target is within 100 feet of at least one other target. When the curse remains on only one target, it ends automatically.
