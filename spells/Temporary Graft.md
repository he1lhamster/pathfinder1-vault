If the head came from a creature that had _[[spells/Darkvision|darkvision]]_, _[[universal monster rules/Low-Light Vision|low-light vision]]_, or _[[universal monster rules/Scent|scent]]_, you gain the appropriate senses at half the normal range. You can speak through either head, but not both simultaneously.

Leg: The leg increases your base movement speed by 5 feet and grants you a +2 bonus to CMD against overrun and _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ combat maneuvers (the usual bonus for having an extra leg).
