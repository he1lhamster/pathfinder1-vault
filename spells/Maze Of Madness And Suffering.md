  "This spell works like _maze_, except the DC of the Intelligence check to escape is 22 and each round a creature remains in the _maze_ a different effect occurs depending on which section of the _maze_ it is in. Roll on the following table each time the creature attempts an Intelligence check to escape the _maze_ to see which part of the _maze_ it wanders through; if a creature doesn't attempt an Intelligence check, it stays in the same section and suffers that section's effects. Any conditions or damage taken persist for the listed duration even if the creature exits the _maze_ before then, but conditions don't stack with themselves.

  _Circus_: The creature finds itself in a nightmarish circus of giant beasts, garishly painted faces, and hideous, mocking laughter.

The creature must succeed at a Will save or become frightened for 2d4 rounds. This is a fear effect. A frightened creature can still attempt Intelligence checks to escape the _maze_, but it takes 3d6 points of slashing and piercing damage from the trees' branches. _Hellscape_: The creature navigates a landscape of fire and stone walls carved with diabolical faces while the cries of the damned echo in the air. The creature must succeed at a Will save or become paralyzed by fear and potential torment for 1 round. This is a fear effect. The creature can't attempt to escape the _maze_ while paralyzed, and if it fails three consecutive saving throws against this paralysis, the hellscape delivers a coup de grace, dealing the creature 4d6 points of fire damage. The creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + the damage dealt) or die. A creature that survives the coup de grace escapes from the paralysis as well. _Oasis of Respite_: Whether it appears as a beautiful glade, a perfumed palace, or a literal desert oasis, this section of the _maze_ is supernaturally peaceful, especially in comparison to the rest of the _maze_. The creature must succeed at a Will save or become fascinated for 1 round. The creature can't attempt to escape the _maze_ while fascinated. A creature that fails three consecutive saving throws to this fascination enters a state of lethargy and gives up ever escaping the _maze_, remaining in this area until the spell ends on its own in 10 minutes (as per _maze_). _Strange City_: The creature journeys through a city of cyclopean architecture under a sky of indescribable color and numerous stars. The creature must succeed at a Will save or take 2d4 points of Wisdom damage. If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), the creature instead takes 2d10 points of sanity damage."
