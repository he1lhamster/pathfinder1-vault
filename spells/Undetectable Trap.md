  "You shroud a single trap with a powerful illusion to make it more difficult to locate. Spells like _detect magic_ can't locate any magic aura from either the target trap or from _undetectable trap_. Furthermore, a character under the effect of the _find traps_ spell doesn't receive an automatic chance to locate the target trap when she comes within 10 feet of it, and the bonus on Perception checks from _find traps_ doesn't apply to attempts to notice the target trap. Add 1/2 your caster level to the DC for any creature without the trapfinding class ability to notice the target trap with Perception checks. A ranger with the ranger traps class feature (_Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic_ 64) can cast this spell on a ranger trap he creates as part of the same action he uses to prepare a ranger trap. This doesn't reduce the spell's casting time if such a ranger casts this spell on an ordinary trap, even one that he created himself using Craft (traps)."
