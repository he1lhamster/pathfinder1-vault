 #### Description
You make the targets light enough to be carried by wind. Creatures affected by this spell suffer cumulative penalties for attacking as if under the effects of _[[spells/Levitate|levitate]]_ unless they have a fly speed. Treat each target as two size categories lighter for the purposes of being checked or blown away by wind. If a target has a fly speed, it can fly overland at the wind's speed in the same direction as the wind by succeeding at a DC 20 Fly check. If a creature flying overland this way attempts to change direction, it risks being blown away as usual. By linking hands or creating a connection with rope, creatures affected by this spell can be towed through the air by a flying creature as if each weighed only one-eighth its actual weight.
