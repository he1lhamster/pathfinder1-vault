  "An illusory duplicate of you steps clumsily into an adjacent square, presenting a tempting target before winking out of existence. Any creature that threatens that square must succeed at a Will save or make an attack of opportunity against the image. The image's AC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your caster level, but as a figment, the image is unaffected by any attack."
