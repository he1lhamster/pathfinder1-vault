 #### Description
You touch an object when you cast this spell, causing the object to shed bright light in a 60-foot radius. This illumination increases the light level for an additional 60 feet by one step (_[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_ becomes dim light, dim light becomes normal light, and normal light becomes bright light). Creatures that take penalties in bright light take them while within the 60-foot radius of this magical light. Despite its name, this spell is not the equivalent of _[[spells/Daylight|daylight]]_ for the purposes of creatures that are damaged or destroyed by such light.
  If _daylight_ is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a light-proof covering, the spell's effects are blocked until the covering is removed.
  _Daylight_ brought into an area of magical _darkness_ (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.
  _Daylight_ counters or dispels any _darkness_ spell of equal or lower level, such as _darkness_.
