  "You write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, or any suitable writing material. The _illusory script_ appears to be some form of foreign or magical writing. Only the person (or people) designated by you at the time of the casting can read the writing; it's unintelligible to any other character.
  Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw. A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to a _suggestion_ implanted in the script by you at the time the _illusory script_ spell was cast. The _suggestion_ lasts only 30 minutes. Typical _suggestion_s include "Close the book and leave," "Forget the existence of this note," and so forth. If successfully dispelled by _dispel magic,_ the _illusory script_ and its secret message disappear.
  The hidden message can be read by a combination of the _true seeing_ spell with the _read magic_ or _comprehend languages_ spell."
