 #### Description
This variant of _[[spells/Planar Binding|planar binding]]_ is specifically used to call one of the most knowledgeable types of outsiders: the immortal and prophetic _[[monsters/Caulborn|caulborn]]_ (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 48). This spell calls a single _caulborn_ into a specially prepared trap. The caster of this spell can compel a bound _caulborn_ only to provide information (using its Knowledge skills or _[[spells/Detect Thoughts|detect thoughts]]_); attempts to compel the _caulborn_ to fight, _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_ a location, or perform some other task automatically fail. This spell otherwise functions as _planar binding_. The most effective gifts for a _caulborn_ are unique books or intelligent creatures upon whose thoughts the _caulborn_ can feed. The true names of _caulborn_ are nearly impossible to discover, as they are not inherently individualistic, but certain reclusive _[[feats/Scholar|scholar]]_ communities in Kaer Maga may know titles by which specific _caulborn_ can be _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_.
