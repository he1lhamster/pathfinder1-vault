  "_Secret page_ alters the contents of a _page_ so that it appears to be something entirely different. The text of a spell can be changed to show another spell of equal or lower level known by the caster.
  This spell cannot be used to change a spell contained on a scroll, but it can be used to hide a scroll. _Explosive runes_ or _sepia snake sigil_ can be cast upon the _secret page_.
  A comprehend languages spell alone cannot reveal a _secret page_'s contents. You are able to reveal the original contents by speaking a special word. You can then peruse the actual _page_ and return it to its _secret page_ form at will. You can also remove the spell by double repetition of the special word. A _detect magic_ spell reveals dim magic on the _page_ in question but does not reveal its true contents. _True seeing_ reveals the presence of the hidden material but does not reveal the contents unless cast in combination with _comprehend languages_. A _secret page_ spell can be dispelled, and the hidden writings can be destroyed by means of an _erase_ spell."
