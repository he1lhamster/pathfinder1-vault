  "You use material from the Shadow Plane to cast a quasi-real, illusory version of a psychic, sorcerer, or wizard enchantment spell of 2nd level or lower. Spells that deal damage or have other effects work as normal unless the affected creature succeeds at a Will save. If the disbelieved enchantment spell has a damaging effect, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur. If recognized as a _shadow_ enchantment_, a damaging spell deals only one-fifth (20%) the normal amount of damage. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save (or spell resistance) that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to _shadow_ enchantment_'s level (3rd) rather than the spell's normal level. Objects, mindless creatures, and creatures immune to mind-affecting effects automatically succeed at their Will saves against this spell."

 #### Description
You use material from the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|Shadow]]_ Plane to cast a quasi-real, illusory version of a _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_, _[[classes/Sorcerer|sorcerer]]_, or _[[classes/Wizard|wizard]]_ enchantment spell of 2nd level or lower. Spells that deal damage or have other effects work as normal unless the affected creature succeeds at a Will save. If the disbelieved enchantment spell has a damaging effect, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur. If recognized as a _[[spells/Shadow Enchantment|shadow enchantment]]_, a damaging spell deals only one-fifth (20%) the normal amount of damage. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save (or _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_) that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to _shadow enchantment_'s level (3rd) rather than the spell's normal level. Objects, mindless creatures, and creatures immune to mind-affecting effects automatically succeed at their Will saves against this spell.
