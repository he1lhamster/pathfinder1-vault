  "This spell allows you to turn a potion into a temporary pool of necromantic energy. Only a potion created using a conjuration (healing) spell can be affected by this spell. An affected potion turns dark red and reveals a necromantic aura if _detect magic_ is cast on it while it remains under this spell's effects.

The bonus to caster level is equal to the spell level of the spell used to create the potion that _deathwine_ affects. For example, a 5th-level wizard who drinks _deathwine_ made from a _potion of _cure serious wounds_ would cast his next necromancy spell as an 8th-level caster, as _cure serious wounds_ i s a 3 rd-level spell. In addition, any undead creature (or other creature healed by negative energy) that drinks a potion affected by _deathwine_ is healed of 1d8 points of damage. Any potion not imbibed before this spell's duration expires is destroyed at the end of the _deathwine_'s duration."

 #### Description
This spell allows you to turn a potion into a temporary pool of necromantic energy. Only a potion created using a conjuration (healing) spell can be affected by this spell. An affected potion turns dark red and reveals a necromantic aura if _[[spells/Detect Magic|detect magic]]_ is cast on it while it remains under this spell's effects. When you drink a potion affected by this spell, you do not gain the potion's normal effect. Instead, the first necromancy spell you cast within the next minute is cast at a higher caster level. The bonus to caster level is equal to the spell level of the spell used to create the potion that _[[spells/Deathwine|deathwine]]_ affects. For example, a 5th-level _[[classes/Wizard|wizard]]_ who drinks _deathwine_ made from a potion of _[[spells/Cure Serious Wounds|cure serious wounds]]_ would cast his next necromancy spell as an 8th-level caster, as _cure serious wounds_ i s a 3 rd-level spell. In addition, any undead creature (or other creature healed by negative energy) that drinks a potion affected by _deathwine_ is healed of 1d8 points of damage. Any potion not imbibed before this spell's duration expires is destroyed at the end of the _deathwine_'s duration.
