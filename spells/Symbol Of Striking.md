  "This spell functions like _symbol of death_, except that using the material component, you scribe a _symbol of striking_ so it fills a 5-foot square. Once triggered, the _symbol of striking_ glows and lasts for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has made a number of attacks of opportunity equal to your level, whichever comes first. When triggered, the symbol threatens its area and the area around it as if it were a Medium creature wielding a magic version of the weapon you used as the material component. Using your caster level + 1 + your Intelligence modifier (magus, witch, wizard) or Wisdom modifier (cleric) or Charisma modifier (oracle, sorcerer) as its attack bonus, the symbol can make a number of attacks of opportunity each round equal to 1 + the same ability score modifier you used to determine its attack bonus. It gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to the same ability score modifier you used to determine its attack bonus. A shadowy version of you wielding the material component appears to make these attacks. The symbol attacks any non-attuned creature that provokes an attack of opportunity from the symbol. However, when the symbol first attacks a creature, the symbol must overcome that creature's spell resistance or be rendered unable to harm it. The symbol never again attacks such creatures. Further, when the symbol first attacks a creature, a successful Will saving throw allows the creature to see the shadow nature of the attacks and take half damage when such attacks hit. _Symbol of striking_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell by a caster of 13th level or higher for the cost of 10,000 gp."

 #### Description
This spell functions like _[[spells/Symbol of Death|symbol of death]]_, except that using the material component, you scribe a _[[spells/Symbol Of Striking|symbol of striking]]_ so it fills a 5-foot square. Once triggered, the _symbol of striking_ glows and lasts for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has made a number of attacks of opportunity equal to your level, whichever comes first. When triggered, the symbol threatens its area and the area around it as if it were a _[[classes/Medium|Medium]]_ creature wielding a magic version of the weapon you used as the material component. Using your caster level + 1 + your Intelligence modifier (_[[classes/Magus|magus]]_, _[[classes/Witch|witch]]_, _[[classes/Wizard|wizard]]_) or Wisdom modifier (_[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_) or Charisma modifier (_[[classes/Oracle|oracle]]_, _[[classes/Sorcerer|sorcerer]]_) as its attack bonus, the symbol can make a number of attacks of opportunity each round equal to 1 + the same ability score modifier you used to determine its attack bonus. It gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to the same ability score modifier you used to determine its attack bonus. A shadowy version of you wielding the material component appears to make these attacks. The symbol attacks any non-attuned creature that provokes an attack of opportunity from the symbol. However, when the symbol first attacks a creature, the symbol must overcome that creature's _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ or be rendered unable to _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ it. The symbol never again attacks such creatures. Further, when the symbol first attacks a creature, a successful Will saving throw allows the creature to see the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|shadow]]_ nature of the attacks and take half damage when such attacks hit. _Symbol of striking_ can be made permanent with a _[[spells/Permanency|permanency]]_ spell by a caster of 13th level or higher for the cost of 10,000 gp.
