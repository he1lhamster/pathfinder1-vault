 #### Description
You dim your targets' perceptions of light and _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|shadow]]_, convincing them the space they occupy is dark. Each creature that fails its save perceives the world around it as one light level darker than its true illumination level. The spell does not change the light level outside of the targets' perception, and does not create magical _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_. However, the spell creates an illusion of _darkness_ rather than actual _darkness_, so low-light and _[[spells/Darkvision|darkvision]]_ don't allow a target to see in the conditions created by the spell. Even targets that see normally through magical _darkness_ suffer a loss of _[[spells/Vision|vision]]_ from this spell.
