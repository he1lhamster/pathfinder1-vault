  "This spell functions as _disguise_ self_, except as a swift action you can alter the _disguise_ (within the limitations of _disguise_ self_). For example, you could make yourself look like a young human city guard, then an old elven wizard of the opposite gender, then a halfling thief, and so on. You can change the _disguise_ a number of times equal to your caster level."
