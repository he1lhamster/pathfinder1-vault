  "Your spell slowly begins to eat away at the defenses of your target. If the target fails its saving throw, it loses 1 point from any damage reduction and natural armor bonus it may have. If the initial save was not successful, the target may attempt a new saving throw each round for the duration of the spell or continue to suffer cumulative losses.
