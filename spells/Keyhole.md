 #### Description
By touching a single door, _[[spells/Gate|gate]]_, or other portal, you create a _[[spells/Keyhole|keyhole]]_ where none existed before or double the size of an existing _keyhole_. A conjured _keyhole_ allows you to peer through the door, though the limited perspective imposes a -10 penalty on Perception checks to spot anything beyond. It also allows a sealed door to be locked or picked if it could not be before. Locking or unlocking such a door requires a successful Disable Device check with a DC equal to the barrier's break DC + 10. Enlarging an existing _keyhole_ allows viewers to peer through to whatever lies beyond, even if the preexisting _keyhole_ did not allow it, and it reduces the Disable Device DC to open or lock the door by 5. This spell does not normally allow a saving throw, but magic doors and barriers can resist the effect with a successful Will saving throw, as if they were carried by their original creator.
