  "Often used by bards, spies, and arcane scholars to steal important texts without alerting their owners, _steal book_ allows you to copy the contents of one book, folio, scroll, or other text to a blank one of sufficient size. In doing so, the original pages are wiped blank, though any covers or binding remain unchanged. Differences in size between the original and the blank folio don't matter, though the blank folio that the information is being transferred to must have an equal or greater amount of space (in number of pages or inches of scroll), or else any text that overflows the document is lost forever.
  This spell cannot transfer magical writing (such as a wizard's spellbook or a magical scroll). At GM's discretion, the spell can restore lost information, such as a page obscured by spill wine, text erased by magic or mundane means, or even pages lost to fire or another type of damage.
  When _steal book_ is cast from a scroll, the beginning of the stolen text appears on the _steal book_ scroll until you select a target book for the text to appear in. The stolen text glitters and sparkles while it remains on the scroll."
