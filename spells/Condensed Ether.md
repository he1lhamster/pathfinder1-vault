 #### Description
You condense the substance of the Ethereal Plane as it interpenetrates the Material Plane. This thickened _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Planar|planar]]_ conjunction slows movement through the area to a crawl. Creatures moving through _[[spells/Condensed Ether|condensed ether]]_ (even _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ creatures), move at only half their normal speed and can't take 5-foot steps. This slowing of movement doesn't stack with _[[spells/Solid Fog|solid fog]]_ or similar effects. Creatures within _condensed ether_ take a -2 penalty to Armor Class and on Reflex saves, and _condensed ether_ prevents effective ranged weapon attacks. Even magic rays and similar ranged attacks suffer a 20% miss chance on attacks into or passing through _condensed ether_. This miss chance is not based on concealment, and _[[feats/Blind-Fight|Blind-Fight]]_, _[[spells/True Seeing|true seeing]]_, and similar effects do not reduce it.
