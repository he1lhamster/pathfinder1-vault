 #### Description
Upon casting this spell, all recipients gain the ability to speak a new language. This language sounds like random, babbling syllables to anyone not under the influence of the spell, but the targets understand each other perfectly. Anyone using _[[spells/Codespeak|codespeak]]_ can read and write in this new language as well. Once the spell expires, however, any coded writing suddenly appears as gibberish. If the exact same group of individuals become the targets of a _codespeak_ spell again, cast by the same caster, they can once again read any coded writings. A dedicated codebreaker can crack such writing's code, deciphering it one page at a time with a series of DC 30 Linguistics checks. _[[spells/Comprehend Languages|Comprehend languages]]_ doesn't enable a caster to understand the language of another's _codespeak_ spell, but it does reveal that the targets are speaking a magical language. _[[spells/Tongues|Tongues]]_ translates _codespeak_ normally.
