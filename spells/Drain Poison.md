  "By touching a weapon against the fang of a poisonous creature and casting this spell, you drain 1 dose of the creature's poison, which is magically applied to your weapon without risk of poisoning yourself. The poison remains on the weapon until either it strikes a creature, you touch the weapon, or you wipe off the poison. It otherwise functions exactly like a dose of a manufactured poison applied to a weapon. You can use this spell with natural as well as manufactured weapons. This spell does not prevent you from exposing yourself to the poison if you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll while the poison is applied to your weapon. The spell has no effect if the creature whose fang is touched is a summoned creature, if it has been dead for more than 1 minute, or if its poison has already been extracted from it."
