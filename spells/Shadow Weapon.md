  "Drawing upon the Plane of Shadow, you shape a quasi-real masterwork melee weapon of a type you are proficient with. You may use this weapon to make attacks as if it were a real weapon, dealing normal damage for a weapon of its type. The first time you hit a creature with the weapon, it may make a Will save to disbelieve; failure means the weapon deals damage normally, success means it only takes 1 point of damage from the weapon's attacks. The weapon only deals 1 point of damage to objects. If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the _shadow weapon_ strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the target may save to disbelieve as normal. At 5th level, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus. At 10th-level, you may increase the enhancement bonus to +2 or add the _frost_ or _keen_ weapon property. The _frost_ and _keen_ properties have no effect if the target makes its disbelief save. The spell ends if the weapon leaves your possession."

 #### Description
Drawing upon the Plane of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|Shadow]]_, you shape a quasi-real masterwork melee weapon of a type you are proficient with. You may use this weapon to make attacks as if it were a real weapon, dealing normal damage for a weapon of its type. The first time you hit a creature with the weapon, it may make a Will save to disbelieve; failure means the weapon deals damage normally, success means it only takes 1 point of damage from the weapon's attacks. The weapon only deals 1 point of damage to objects. If an attacked creature has _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that _spell resistance_ the first time the _[[spells/Shadow Weapon|shadow weapon]]_ strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the target may save to disbelieve as normal. At 5th level, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus. At 10th-level, you may increase the enhancement bonus to +2 or add the frost or _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Keen|keen]]_ weapon property. The frost and _keen_ properties have no effect if the target makes its disbelief save. The spell ends if the weapon leaves your _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_.
