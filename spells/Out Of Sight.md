  "The spell inhibits the memories of creatures that perceive you. While creatures can perceive you normally, when a creature stops observing you, it must attempt a Will save (spell resistance applies). If it fails, it loses all memory of its awareness of you and your actions while you were under the effects of this spell.

 #### Description
The spell inhibits the memories of creatures that perceive you. While creatures can perceive you normally, when a creature stops observing you, it must attempt a Will save (_[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ applies). If it fails, it loses all memory of its awareness of you and your actions while you were under the effects of this spell. The spell's duration listed above measures how long the _[[spells/Out Of Sight|out of sight]]_ effect lasts on you, but the memory alteration is instantaneous and can be reversed only by magic such as _[[spells/Modify Memory|modify memory]]_. The creature is still aware of any other changes to itself or its environment. For instance, a _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_ will remember running, and may notice a newly unlocked door, but will not remember that he was chasing after you.
