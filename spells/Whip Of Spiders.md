  "You summon hundreds of Diminutive spiders, which cling together in the form of a whip made for a creature of your size. You can wield this object as if it were an actual whip, except you make a melee touch attack with it instead of a regular attack. Any creature you strike with the whip takes swarm damage as if it were attacked by a spider swarm (1d6 points of damage plus poison and distraction, _Bestiary_ 258). The swarm whip is able to damage creatures with armor or natural armor, even if a normal whip could not. It cannot be used to make bull rush, grapple, or trip attacks, and (unlike a swarm) is subject to a miss chance for concealment and cover.
  The whip is immune to all weapon damage, is never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage, and is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate). The whip takes half again as much damage from spells or effects that affect an area, but since it is considered part of your gear, it takes damage only if you fail a saving throw on a 1 or if it is specifically targeted by an opponent. The whip does not have a swarm's susceptibility to high winds.
  As a standard action, you can transform the whip into a spider swarm (all squares of the swarm must be within 15 feet of you); thereafter it functions as _summon swarm_. The spider swarm has 3 hit points and persists in that form for 2 rounds or until the end of this spell's duration, whichever comes first."

 #### Description
You _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ hundreds of Diminutive spiders, which cling together in the form of a _[[items/Weapon/Whip|whip]]_ made for a creature of your size. You can wield this object as if it were an actual _whip_, except you make a melee touch attack with it instead of a regular attack. Any creature you strike with the _whip_ takes swarm damage as if it were attacked by a spider swarm (1d6 points of damage plus poison and _[[universal monster rules/Distraction|distraction]]_, Bestiary 258). The swarm _whip_ is able to damage creatures with armor or natural armor, even if a normal _whip_ could not. It cannot be used to make bull rush, grapple, or _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ attacks, and (unlike a swarm) is subject to a miss chance for concealment and cover.
  The _whip_ is immune to all weapon damage, is never _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ or reduced to a _[[conditions/Dying|dying]]_ state by damage, and is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as _[[spells/Disintegrate|disintegrate]]_). The _whip_ takes half again as much damage from spells or effects that affect an area, but since it is considered part of your gear, it takes damage only if you fail a saving throw on a 1 or if it is specifically targeted by an opponent. The _whip_ does not have a swarm's susceptibility to high winds.
  As a standard action, you can transform the _whip_ into a spider swarm (all squares of the swarm must be within 15 feet of you); thereafter it functions as _[[spells/Summon Swarm|summon swarm]]_. The spider swarm has 3 hit points and persists in that form for 2 rounds or until the end of this spell's duration, whichever comes first.
