 #### Description
You change a specially prepared _[[items/Weapon/Quarterstaff|quarterstaff]]_ into a Huge treant-like creature (see the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary), about 24 feet tall.
  When you plant the end of the staff in the ground and speak a special _[[spells/Command|command]]_ to conclude the casting of the spell, your staff turns into a creature that looks and fights just like a _[[monsters/Treant|treant]]_.
  The staff-treant defends you and obeys any spoken commands.
