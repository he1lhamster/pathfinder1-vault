For instance, if a creature falls through 20 feet of a low_gravity_ sphere_ and an additional 30 feet outside the sphere, it would take 1d6 points of damage for the 20 feet of low _gravity_ plus 3d6 points of damage as normal for the 30 feet outside the sphere (for a total of 4d6 points of damage).
  This spell doesn't counteract or negate the effects of other spells that affect _gravity_; both effects occur simultaneously. For instance, a no-_gravity_ _gravity_ sphere_ spell cast within the area of a _reverse _gravity_ spell would simply mean that creatures float about until the _gravity_ sphere_'s duration expires or they exit the _gravity_ sphere_, at which point they return to the top of the _reverse _gravity_ effect's area. If both _gravity_-altering magical effects could not feasibly take place simultaneously (at the GM's discretion), the _gravity_ sphere_ spell supersedes the previous effect (if it's higherlevel than the previous effect) or simply fails (if it's lower-level)."

 #### Description
You affect the local gravity field in a 30-foot-radius sphere around the spell's designated point of origin. Creatures in the affected area can be weighed down by high gravity, lightened by low gravity, or left to float in an area with no gravity, depending on the effect you choose for your _[[spells/Gravity Sphere|gravity sphere]]_. See page 18 for rules on the effects of high, low, and no gravity.
  Creatures that fall within the area of a _gravity sphere_ spell take more damage from the fall if the gravity within is higher and less damage if the gravity within is lower. However, if the creature falls through a _gravity sphere_ and continues to fall in a non-affected area, the rest of the fall damage is calculated normally. For instance, if a creature falls through 20 feet of a lowgravity sphere and an additional 30 feet outside the sphere, it would take 1d6 points of damage for the 20 feet of low gravity plus 3d6 points of damage as normal for the 30 feet outside the sphere (for a total of 4d6 points of damage).
  This spell doesn't counteract or negate the effects of other spells that affect gravity; both effects occur simultaneously. For instance, a no-gravity _gravity sphere_ spell cast within the area of a _[[spells/Reverse Gravity|reverse gravity]]_ spell would simply mean that creatures float about until the _gravity sphere_'s duration expires or they exit the _gravity sphere_, at which point they return to the top of the _reverse gravity_ effect's area. If both gravity-altering magical effects could not feasibly take place simultaneously (at the GM's discretion), the _gravity sphere_ spell supersedes the previous effect (if it's higherlevel than the previous effect) or simply fails (if it's lower-level).
