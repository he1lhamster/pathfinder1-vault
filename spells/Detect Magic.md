  "You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.
  _1st Round_: Presence or absence of magical auras.
  _2nd Round_: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.
  _3rd Round_: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).
  Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.
  _Aura Strength_: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.

  _Lingering Aura_: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If _detect magic_ is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

  _Detect magic_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell."

 #### Description
You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.
  1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.
  2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ aura.
  3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ its properties (see Spellcraft).
  Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.
  Aura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, _[[spells/Detect Magic|detect magic]]_ indicates the stronger of the two.
  
  <table><tbody><tr><th>Spell or Object</th><th>Aura Power</th></tr> <tr><th>Faint</th><th>Moderate</th><th>Strong</th><th>Overwhelming</th></tr> <tr><td>Functioning spell (spell level)</td><td>3rd or lower</td><td>4th-6th</td><td>7th-9th</td><td>10th+ (deity-level)</td></tr> <tr><td>Magic item (caster level)</td><td>5th or lower</td><td>6th-11th</td><td>12th-20th</td><td>21st+ (artifact)</td></tr></tbody></table>
  
  Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If _detect magic_ is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:
