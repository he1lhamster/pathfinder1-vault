  "This spell functions like _arcane eye_, except that it uses an _ioun stone_ as a visible scrying sensor. The _ioun stone_ moves at the same rate as an _arcane eye_, and may pass through holes or spaces as small as 2 inches in diameter. It can enter another plane of existence using a _gate_ or similar portal, but the caster loses contact with the sensor should this occur. The enhanced _ioun stone_ has AC 24, 10 hp, hardness 5, fly speed 30 (perfect), and a +16 Stealth bonus. The stone does not provide you with its normal benefits while you are using it as a scrying sensor."
