  "This spell reverses gravity in an area, causing unattached objects and creatures in the area to fall upward and reach the top of the area in 1 round.

  Provided it has something to hold onto, a creature caught in the area can attempt a Reflex save to secure itself when the spell strikes.
  Creatures who can fly or levitate can keep themselves from falling."
