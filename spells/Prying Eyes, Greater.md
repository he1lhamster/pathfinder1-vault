  "This spell functions like _prying eyes,_ except that the eyes can see all things as they actually are, just as if they had _true seeing_ with a range of 120 feet. Thus, they can navigate darkened areas at normal speed. Also, a _greater prying eye_'s maximum Perception modifier is +25 instead of +15."
