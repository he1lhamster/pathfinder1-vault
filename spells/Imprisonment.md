  "When you cast _imprisonment_ and touch a creature, it is entombed in a state of suspended animation (see the _temporal stasis_ spell) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the ground. The subject remains there unless a _freedom_ spell is cast at the locale where the _imprisonment_ took place.

A _wish_ or _miracle_ spell will not free the recipient, but will reveal where it is entombed. If you know the target's name and some facts about its life, the target takes a -4 penalty on its save."
