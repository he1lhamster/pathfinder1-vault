  "To cast _open the_ _Dead Roads_, you must be in an area of fog or dim light. Upon completion of the spell, swirling mists part and deposit you and any creatures you touched on a nearby stretch of the _Dead Roads_, a network of extraplanar roadways. You can take up to one creature per level, but all targets must be touching each other. You must specify a location known to you or one of your travelers as your destination when casting this spell. When traveling the otherworldly paths of the _Dead Roads_, you move at a speed of 50 miles per hour regardless of the terrain on the Material Plane. Your own movement speed does not change; you simply arrive at distant destinations more quickly because the _Dead Roads_ offer a shorter route. You can exit the _Dead Roads_ at any point before reaching your destination by wandering off the path, in which case you are usually returned to your starting place. If this would place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available.
  Because the _Dead Roads_ occupy another plane, it is impossible to spy on the Material Plane while using this spell without additional spells or supernatural abilities.
  _Open the_ _Dead Roads_ can be used to travel to or from the Shadow Plane, the Ethereal Plane, the Astral Plane, or the Boneyard; any of these destinations requires 10 hours of travel. Thanks to their unique nature, the _Dead Roads_ can be used to travel from any plane to the Material Plane-a trip likewise requiring 10 hours-unless that plane normally bars all extraplanar travel.
  Creatures you bring with you to the _Dead Roads_ are not obligated to follow you. If they wander off, there is an 80% chance they arrive at a random point on the Material Plane within 2d6x10 miles of your starting point, otherwise they arrive in the Boneyard."

 #### Description
To cast _[[spells/Open The Dead Roads|open the Dead Roads]]_, you must be in an area of fog or dim light. Upon completion of the spell, swirling mists part and deposit you and any creatures you touched on a nearby stretch of the Dead Roads, a network of extraplanar roadways. You can take up to one creature per level, but all targets must be touching each other. You must specify a location known to you or one of your travelers as your destination when casting this spell. When traveling the otherworldly paths of the Dead Roads, you move at a speed of 50 miles per hour regardless of the terrain on the Material Plane. Your own movement speed does not change; you simply arrive at distant destinations more quickly because the Dead Roads offer a shorter route. You can exit the Dead Roads at any point before reaching your destination by wandering off the path, in which case you are usually returned to your starting place. If this would place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available.
