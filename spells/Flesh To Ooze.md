 #### Description
This functions like _[[spells/Baleful Polymorph|baleful polymorph]]_, except the target becomes an ooze. A creature of 3 HD or less becomes a _[[monsters/Gray Ooze|gray ooze]]_, 4–9 HD becomes a _[[monsters/Gelatinous Cube|gelatinous cube]]_ or _[[monsters/Ochre Jelly|ochre jelly]]_, and 10+ HD becomes a _[[monsters/Black Pudding|black pudding]]_. Alternatively, instead of a creature you may target a quantity of inert flesh (such as that created by the _[[spells/Stone to Flesh|stone to flesh]]_ spell) of sufficient mass, which becomes an ooze of your choice.Because a target's gear does not transform with it, any items fall under or within the ooze's body, which may mean the items are destroyed. If the ooze has the _[[universal monster rules/Split|split]]_ ability, splitting the ooze creates one ooze that retains the creature's original identity (for the purpose of memories or restoring the creature) and one normal mindless ooze of that type.
