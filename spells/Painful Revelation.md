  "You augment an ongoing illusion effect to strike out painfully at creatures that see through it. When a creature successfully disbelieves an illusion that is the target of _painful revelation_, it takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage for every 2 caster levels you have (maximum 10d6) and is staggered for 1d4 rounds.

However, creatures under the effect of spells such as _true seeing_ that automatically pierce illusions are not subject to this effect."
