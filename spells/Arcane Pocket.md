  "With a touch, you conjure an extradimensional space inside a pouch or pocket. The pocket acts as a _bag of holding_, except it can hold only 10 pounds per caster level. Regardless of what is placed into the pocket, it weighs 3 pounds. Unlike a _bag of holding_, the pocket created by this ability cannot be overloaded or ruptured-any additional material simply spills out of the top-nor does it have any special interaction with other kinds of extradimensional spaces.

The pocket becomes nonmagical, spilling all of its contents onto the ground unharmed, if it leaves your possession or you create a new _arcane pocket_."
