  "You create several illusory doubles of yourself, where you and each image all seem slightly off or wrong in appearance. Treat this spell as _mirror_ image_, except as noted. Each creature that can see the doubles must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for as long as it can see any of the doubles. A successful saving throw negates the shaken condition and renders the creature immune to the further effects of this spell (beyond the usual effects of _mirror_ image_). In addition, the first time a creature that failed its initial saving throw destroys one of the images, it must succeed at a Will save or its perception of the double shifts at the last second. The double takes on the face of the attacker, the face of a loved one, or some other equally disturbing image, causing the attacker to become frightened for 1 round and take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage from the traumatic shock. Both additional effects are mind-affecting fear effects, and spell resistance applies against them. If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), a creature takes 1d8 points of sanity damage instead of Wisdom damage."

 #### Description
You create several illusory doubles of yourself, where you and each image all seem slightly off or wrong in appearance. Treat this spell as _[[spells/Mirror Image|mirror image]]_, except as noted. Each creature that can see the doubles must succeed at a Will save or become _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for as long as it can see any of the doubles. A successful saving throw negates the _shaken_ condition and renders the creature immune to the further effects of this spell (beyond the usual effects of _mirror image_). In addition, the first time a creature that failed its initial saving throw destroys one of the images, it must succeed at a Will save or its perception of the double shifts at the last second. The double takes on the face of the attacker, the face of a loved one, or some other equally disturbing image, causing the attacker to become _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_ for 1 round and take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage from the traumatic _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Shock|shock]]_. Both additional effects are mind-affecting _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effects, and _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ applies against them. If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), a creature takes 1d8 points of sanity damage instead of Wisdom damage.
