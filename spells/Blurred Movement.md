  "This spell functions as _blur_, except that the _blur_ring occurs only when you move at least 10 feet on your turn and ceases at the end of your movement. It is therefore mainly used to thwart attacks on your turn, such as attacks of opportunity. If you move at least twice your speed on your turn, the _blur_ring lasts until the start of your next turn."
