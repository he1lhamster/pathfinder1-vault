It gains the benefits of the Multiattack and Multiweapon Fighting feats. _Malenti_: The sahuagin's features shift to resemble those of an aquatic elf. It loses its light blindness as well as its claw and bite attacks. The sahuagin gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, and a +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear to be an aquatic elf. _Prehistoric_: The sahuagin grows in size, as _enlarge person_.

Any creature that successfully grapples with it, is grappled by it, or hits it with an unarmed strike or natural weapon takes 1d4 points of piercing damage. The sahuagin also gains the benefits of the Improved Grapple feat."
