  "You accept otherworldly energies into your body and transform.
  Your size increases by one category, your height doubles, and your weight increases by a factor of eight. Your features shift into those of a cold and alien being of logic, a creature of primal chaos, an angelic presence, or a fiendish monster, as chosen by you. You gain a +6 size bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +3 natural armor bonus, darkvision 60 ft., and SR of 12 + your caster level.

  This spell doesn't change your base speed. Determine space and reach as appropriate for your new size.
  If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, you attain the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using your increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process (see page 175 of the _Core Rulebook_ for rules on breaking objects).

  All equipment you wear or carry is similarly enlarged by this spell. Melee weapons deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell.

You gain a bite attack dealing 2d6 points of damage. Your natural weapons and any weapons you wield are considered chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance.
  **Axiomatic** aspect: You gain the following abilities: an additional +2 bonus to Strength, DR 10/chaotic, resist cold 10, electricity 10, and fire 10, a +4 bonus on saves against poison, low-light vision, and a fly speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability). You gain 2 slam attacks dealing 1d6 points of damage each. Your natural weapons and any weapons you wield are considered lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance.
