 #### Description
You create a written _[[spells/Message|message]]_ of 50 words or fewer, or else an image, a drawing, or a similar diagram. The figment hangs _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ and obscured upon the target surface for the duration of the spell. Another casting of _[[spells/Geomessage|geomessage]]_ is needed to cause the figment to arrange itself into the intended _message_. When you cast the spell, you can choose to incorporate a passphrase into the spell. If you do so, the _message_ is protected as if _[[spells/Nondetection|nondetection]]_ had been cast on it for the full duration of the spell, though creatures that cast _geomessage_ on the surface and speak the passphrase ignore the _nondetection_ effect and cause the image to become visible until the caster speaks the passphrase again. Without a passphrase, the _message_ simply remains _invisible_ to those who cast _geomessage_. Detection methods like _[[spells/Detect Magic|detect magic]]_ and _[[spells/See Invisibility|see invisibility]]_ indicate the _message_'s presence but do not reveal its contents.
