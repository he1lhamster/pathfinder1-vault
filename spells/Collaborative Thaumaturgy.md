  "You tap into the magical resonance between you and your allies to enhance one another's magic. Cast this spell when an ally casts a spell at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell she can cast.
  The ally casts her spell as if one of the following metamagic feats were applied to it without increasing the spell level or casting time: Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Silent Spell, or Still Spell.
