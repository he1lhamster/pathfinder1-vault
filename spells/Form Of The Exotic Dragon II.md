Druids can choose from the primal dragon (brine, cloud, crystal, magma, or umbral) forms only. You gain the following abilities: a +6 size bonus to your Strength, a +4 size bonus to your Constitution, a +6 natural armor bonus, a fly speed of 90 feet (poor), darkvision with a range of 60 feet, a breath weapon, damage reduction 5/magic, and resistance to one form of energy or some other bonus. You gain one bite attack (2d6), two claw attacks (1d8), a tail slap attack (1d8), and either a gore attack (2d6) if you assume the form of an imperial dragon or two wing attacks (1d6) if you assume the form of a primal dragon. All breath weapons deal 8d8 points of damage unless noted and allow a Reflex save to halve the normal damage. Line breath weapons increase to 80-foot lines and cones increase to 40-foot cones."
