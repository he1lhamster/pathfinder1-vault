  "You identify the stage of a given soul's judgment, or determine its fate post-judgment. You must either unambiguously identify the soul you seek or use the skull of the body the soul vacated as a focus. If the subject does not share your alignment, the soul can attempt a Will save to resist this spell's effects as if it were still alive. If the subject is still alive or its soul has been destroyed, this spell fails without providing any information. If the soul has not yet been judged and moved on to its final reward or punishment, _soulseeker_ provides an estimate of its location; in most cases, this is somewhere in the River of Souls or the Boneyard. While this may assist in physically traveling to the soul's location, especially in cases involving effects such as _soul bind_ or a devourer's devour soul ability, the spell's primary purpose is to identify how long the subject has been dead (and what form of life-restoring magic is necessary). If the soul has already been judged, _soulseeker_ instead identifies the plane to which the soul has been sent as a petitioner and the petitioner's general location on that plane (such as "Elysium, beneath the boughs of the Witchwood"). If _soulseeker_ is cast on the same plane on which the soul's new petitioner form currently exists, it guides you along the shortest, most direct physical route to the petitioner, as described in _find the path_. In this case, the spell's duration is 1 hour per level."

 #### Description
You _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ the stage of a given soul's judgment, or determine its fate post-judgment. You must either unambiguously _identify_ the soul you seek or use the skull of the body the soul vacated as a focus. If the subject does not share your alignment, the soul can attempt a Will save to resist this spell's effects as if it were still alive. If the subject is still alive or its soul has been destroyed, this spell fails without providing any information. If the soul has not yet been judged and moved on to its final reward or punishment, _[[spells/Soulseeker|soulseeker]]_ provides an estimate of its location; in most cases, this is somewhere in the River of Souls or the Boneyard. While this may assist in physically traveling to the soul's location, especially in cases involving effects such as _[[spells/Soul Bind|soul bind]]_ or a _[[monsters/Devourer|devourer]]_'s devour soul ability, the spell's primary purpose is to _identify_ how long the subject has been dead (and what form of life-restoring magic is necessary). If the soul has already been judged, _soulseeker_ instead identifies the plane to which the soul has been sent as a _[[monsters/Petitioner|petitioner]]_ and the _petitioner_'s general location on that plane (such as "Elysium, beneath the boughs of the Witchwood"). If _soulseeker_ is cast on the same plane on which the soul's new _petitioner_ form currently exists, it guides you along the shortest, most direct physical route to the _petitioner_, as described in _[[spells/Find the Path|find the path]]_. In this case, the spell's duration is 1 hour per level.
