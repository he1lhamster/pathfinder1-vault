  "You create an invisible barrier that surrounds you and moves with you, inhibiting one category of magic. When you cast this spell, choose either arcane or divine magic. This spell functions like _antimagic field_, but it suppresses only spells of the chosen type and supernatural and spell-like class abilities from classes that grant spellcasting of the selected type. Magic items, other spell-like abilities, and other supernatural abilities are unaffected.
