  "You make the target an asymptomatic carrier for a host of virulent diseases. Creatures that end their turn adjacent to the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be affected as if by the spell _contagion_. The target itself does not become diseased, and suffers no ill effects from this spell. Once _plague bearer_ ends, the target is no longer contagious, though any creature it infected remains diseased."
