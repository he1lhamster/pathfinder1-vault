  "A touched creature becomes invisible (as per invisibility) as long as it is in direct sunlight (or bright light shed by a _daylight_ spell). If an action the target creature takes causes the invisible creature to become visible but does not end the _sunstalker_ spell's duration, the creature can use this spell's magic to become invisible again as a standard action as long as it stands in an area of sunlight (as defined above). The creature gains only concealment (20% miss chance) in normal light."
