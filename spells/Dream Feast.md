  "The next time the target sleeps (within the next 8 hours), she dreams of a rich feast with her favorite foods and drinks. When she awakens, she is sated as if she had eaten a nutritious meal, regardless of what she dreamed she ate. The target must sleep for at least 1 hour to gain the benefits of this spell.
