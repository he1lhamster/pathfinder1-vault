 #### Description
You create an unmoving, opaque sphere of force of any color you desire around yourself. Half the sphere projects above the ground, and the lower hemisphere passes through the ground.

However, if you remove yourself from the hut, the spell ends.
  The temperature inside the hut is 70 F if the exterior temperature is between 0 and 100 F. An exterior temperature below 0 or above 100 lowers or raises the interior temperature on a 1-degree-for-1 basis. The hut also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms.

  The interior of the hut is a hemisphere. You can illuminate it dimly upon _[[spells/Command|command]]_ or extinguish the light as desired. Although the force field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent from within. Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects can pass through the hut without affecting it, although the occupants cannot be seen from outside the hut (they have total concealment).
