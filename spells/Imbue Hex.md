 #### Description
You transfer a single hex you know to the target, and give that target the ability to use the hex. The transferred hex's variable characteristics function according to your level, not the level of the recipient. Only a creature with Intelligence and Wisdom scores of at least 9 can receive this effect. To use this hex, the target must be able to speak and move freely. Once it uses the hex, the spell ends (though any effects of the hex still last for the full duration). You can transfer only a hex-not a major or grand hex-with this ability. Once you cast _[[spells/Imbue Hex|imbue hex]]_, you cannot use the transferred hex until the spell is discharged, dispelled, or dismissed.
