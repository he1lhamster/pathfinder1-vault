Removing enough mud to end the _slow_ effect is a full-round action. Jumping into a lake or being subject to an effect that creates a lot of water (such as _[[spells/Create Water|create water]]_ or hydraulic pushAPG) removes all the mud in 1 round.
  A _[[spells/Haste|haste]]_ effect cast on a creature slowed by the mud allows it to act normally for the duration of the _haste_. _Slow_ does not stack with the effects of _[[spells/Slowing Mud|slowing mud]]_. This spell cannot counter or dispel _haste_.
