If the creature fails its save, it believes it has been poisoned and must make Fortitude saves at the spell's DC to avoid suffering illusory poison damage.
  _Delay poison_ allows the target to ignore the effects of the phantasmal poison until the _delay poison_ spell ends, at which time it may make a Will save to realize the poison is illusory and recover all illusory poison damage. _Neutralize poison_, _lesser restoration_, _or restoration_ immediately recovers all damage from the spell. A successful _dispel magic_ spell ends the effect of the illusion, as do spells that penetrate illusions (such as _true_ seeing).

You create a phantasm of an oily green _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Phantasmal|phantasmal]]_ poison on the target weapon. The first creature hit by the poisoned weapon must make a Will save against the illusion spell; success means the spell has no effect and is expended from the weapon.

  _[[spells/Delay Poison|Delay poison]]_ allows the target to ignore the effects of the _phantasmal_ poison until the _delay poison_ spell ends, at which time it may make a Will save to realize the poison is illusory and recover all _illusory poison_ damage. _[[spells/Neutralize Poison|Neutralize poison]]_, lesser _[[spells/Restoration|restoration]]_, or _restoration_ immediately recovers all damage from the spell. A successful _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ spell ends the effect of the illusion, as do spells that penetrate illusions (such as _[[spells/True Seeing|true seeing]]_).
