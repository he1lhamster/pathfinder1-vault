If you have an animal companion, it does not become hostile, but as long as you remain cursed, your animal companion takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws.

  Nature's exile can be removed with _break enchantment_, _limited _wish_, _miracle_, _remove curse_, or _wish_."
