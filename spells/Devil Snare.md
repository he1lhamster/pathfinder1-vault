 #### Description
Your touch creates an _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ circle on a flat surface. Any outsider passing through this circle must succeed at a Will save or be caught within. Once trapped, a creature must succeed at a Will save as a standard action to physically exit the confines of the circle, teleport, or use any form of extradimensional travel (as per _[[spells/Dimensional Anchor|dimensional anchor]]_). Contained outsiders can still attack adjacent creatures outside of the circle, or target others with ranged attacks, spells, and _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_. Despite the spell's name, _[[spells/Devil Snare|devil snare]]_ captures outsiders of any type, not only devils.

An outsider can resist this effect with a successful Will save, enabling it to remain after the spell is dismissed.
