  "You transform the target weapon into pure blightburn. The weapon functions as normal, but any creature that touches it, or that it strikes, takes 2d6 points of fire damage each round it remains in contact. In addition, the weapon emanates an aura of radiation that causes blightburn sickness. This is as the disease (see page 29), but with a 10-foot radius and a save DC equal to this spell's save DC."
