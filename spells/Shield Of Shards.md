 #### Description
This defensive spell must be cast on a _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ you are currently wielding, and fractures the _shield_ into two shards, plus one additional shard per 2 caster levels (to a maximum of 12 shards at 20th level). While _[[spells/Shield Of Shards|shield of shards]]_ is active, you lose your _shield_'s bonus to AC as its _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ pieces orbit you. On your turn, you can direct the shards to attack an adjacent opponent as a move action. The shards' attack bonus is equal to your caster level + the modifier for the ability score that determines your spell save DCs. The shards deal an amount of slashing and piercing damage equal to 1d4 points + 1 point per shard beyond the first, and have a threat range of 19-20. They are considered magic weapons for the purpose of bypassing _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_. Additionally, if your _shield_ is made from a special material (such as adamantine), the shards penetrate _damage reduction_ and hardness as if they were weapons made from the same material. At the end of this spell's duration, the shards reform into their original _shield_ form. You regain its _shield_ bonus to AC, provided you still have a free hand in which to wield it. Otherwise, the _shield_ falls at your feet in your square.
