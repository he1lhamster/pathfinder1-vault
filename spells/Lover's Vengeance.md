  "You inspire yourself or a lover to a vengeful _rage_ against a chosen enemy, who must be a creature that has wronged you in some way.

If cast on a lover, he or she gains the benefits of a _rage_ spell the next time the lover is in combat against your enemy. This variant of the spell must be cast within 1 hour of an intimate encounter with the target. The _rage_ effect lasts 1 round per level.
