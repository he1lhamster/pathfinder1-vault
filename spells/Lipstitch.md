  "A rare spell without verbal components, _lipstitch_ sews the target's lips tightly together if it fails a saving throw, such that no clear speech, bite attacks, spellcasting, or use of command words is possible. The target takes 1d6 points of damage as the stitches weave through flesh. The victim can still make enough noise to be heard at a distance with a DC 10 Perception check.
  The thread created by _lipstitch_ can be burst with a DC 20 Strength check as a standard action or can be sliced open with a piercing or slashing weapon (wielded by the target or an ally) as a full-round action. Cutting the thread provokes attacks of opportunity, while making a Strength check does not. Either option causes 1d6 points of damage and 1 point of bleed damage. The target has a 20% chance of failing to cast spells with verbal components until the bleeding is stopped. The effects of multiple castings of this spell do not stack. Optionally, the thread can be removed more carefully over the course of a minute with a DC 20 Heal check. If the check fails, the target takes damage and bleeds as described above. If the check succeeds, the stitches are removed with no harm. Creatures with no mouths are unaffected by _lipstitch_. Creatures with multiple mouths lose the use of only one mouth per casting-the particular mouth is chosen by the caster."

 #### Description
A rare spell without verbal components, _[[spells/Lipstitch|lipstitch]]_ sews the target's lips tightly together if it fails a saving throw, such that no clear speech, bite attacks, spellcasting, or use of _[[spells/Command|command]]_ words is possible. The target takes 1d6 points of damage as the stitches weave through flesh. The victim can still make enough noise to be heard at a distance with a DC 10 Perception check.
  The thread created by _lipstitch_ can be burst with a DC 20 Strength check as a standard action or can be sliced open with a piercing or slashing weapon (wielded by the target or an ally) as a full-round action. Cutting the thread provokes attacks of opportunity, while making a Strength check does not. Either option causes 1d6 points of damage and 1 point of _[[universal monster rules/Bleed|bleed]]_ damage. The target has a 20% chance of failing to cast spells with verbal components until the bleeding is stopped. The effects of multiple castings of this spell do not stack. Optionally, the thread can be removed more carefully over the course of a minute with a DC 20 _[[spells/Heal|Heal]]_ check. If the check fails, the target takes damage and bleeds as described above. If the check succeeds, the stitches are removed with no _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_. Creatures with no mouths are unaffected by _lipstitch_. Creatures with multiple mouths lose the use of only one mouth per casting-the particular mouth is chosen by the caster.
