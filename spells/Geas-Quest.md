 #### Description
This spell functions similarly to lesser geas, except that it affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw.
  If the subject is prevented from obeying the geas/quest for 24 hours, it takes a -3 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another -3 penalty accumulates, up to a total of -12. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the geas/quest.
  A _[[spells/Remove Curse|remove curse]]_ spell ends a geas/quest spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. _[[spells/Break Enchantment|Break enchantment]]_ does not end a geas/quest, but _[[spells/Limited Wish|limited wish]]_, _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_, and _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ do.
  Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as geas, while clerics call the same spell quest.
