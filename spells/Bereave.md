  "An overwhelming feeling of loss overcomes the targets, and their allies' words sound bleak and hollow.

Allies of an affected creature must succeed at a melee touch attack to affect the subject with touch spells, and an affected creature cannot voluntarily fail a saving throw even if the effect is harmless (such as _cure light_ wounds). An affected creature still counts as her own ally and can target herself with abilities, effects, and spells normally."

 #### Description
An overwhelming feeling of loss overcomes the targets, and their allies' words sound bleak and hollow. Regardless of actual allegiances, affected creatures no longer count as allies for other creatures and always count as enemies for the purposes of abilities, effects, and spells that differentiate between allies and enemies, such as flanking or spells such as _[[spells/Bane|bane]]_ or _[[spells/Bless|bless]]_. Allies of an affected creature must succeed at a melee touch attack to affect the subject with touch spells, and an affected creature cannot voluntarily fail a saving throw even if the effect is harmless (such as _[[spells/Cure Light Wounds|cure light wounds]]_). An affected creature still counts as her own ally and can target herself with abilities, effects, and spells normally.
