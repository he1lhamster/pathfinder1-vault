 #### Description
This spell functions similarly to _[[spells/Plane Shift|plane shift]]_, but instead of transporting the targets to a destination near an intended location on a specific plane, _[[spells/Anywhere But Here|anywhere but here]]_ transports affected creatures to a random plane. A creature can be affected by _anywhere but here_ only if it is currently not on its home plane (although targets can, by chance, end up traveling to their home plane as a result of this spell). Subjects always appear in a location that is not inherently harmful, but the exact destination is otherwise random. The specific plane is determined by the table below; the location on the destination plane where the transported creatures arrive is completely subject to the GM's whim.
  
  <table><tbody><tr><th>d%</th><th>_[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Planar|Planar]]_ Destination</th></tr><tr><td>1-7</td><td>Abyss</td></tr><tr><td>8-14</td><td>Abaddon</td></tr><tr><td>15-20</td><td>Hell</td></tr><tr><td>21-24</td><td>_[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|Shadow]]_ Plane</td></tr><tr><td>25-28</td><td>First World</td></tr><tr><td>29-35</td><td>Maelstrom</td></tr><tr><td>36-42</td><td>Boneyard</td></tr><tr><td>43-49</td><td>Axis</td></tr><tr><td>50-56</td><td>Ethereal Plane</td></tr><tr><td>57-63</td><td>Elysium</td></tr><tr><td>64-70</td><td>Nirvana</td></tr><tr><td>71-77</td><td>Heaven</td></tr><tr><td>78-84</td><td>Astral Plane</td></tr><tr><td>85-90</td><td>Random demiplane</td></tr><tr><td>91-95</td><td>Material Plane (random world)</td></tr><tr><td>96-100</td><td>GM's choice</td></tr></tbody></table>
  
  A creature that is transported by _anywhere but here_ cannot be affected by a subsequent casting of _anywhere but here_ for 24 hours afterward (but can be affected normally by other forms of _planar_ travel).
