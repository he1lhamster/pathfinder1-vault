 #### Description
You imbue a weapon with a faint silvery glow that dimly illuminates a 5-foot square. An affected weapon also easily bypasses the physical defenses of undead creatures, ignoring 5 points of an undead creature's _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_, as long as the _damage reduction_ is not DR/epic. For example, attacks with a weapon affected by this spell completely ignore a zombie's DR 5/slashing or reduce a _[[monsters/Lich|lich]]_'s _damage reduction_ to DR 10/bludgeoning and magic. You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike. _[[spells/Funereal Weapon|Funereal weapon]]_ affects the DR of only undead creatures.
