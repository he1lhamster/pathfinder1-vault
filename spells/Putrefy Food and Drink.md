  "This spell causes otherwise edible food to rot and spoil instantly, and water and other liquids to become brackish and undrinkable. Holy water and similar food and drink of significance are spoiled by _putrefy food and drink_, but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type, nor upon unholy water.
