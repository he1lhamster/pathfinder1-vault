  "You create a disk of sunlight on one arm. Any creature that strikes you with a melee attack deals normal damage, but also takes 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). Creatures with reach weapons are not subject to this damage if they attack you. The shield provides illumination as if it were a _continual flame_ spell. You can only have one instance of this spell in effect at a time. It does not stack with similar damaging aura spells such as _fire shield_."
