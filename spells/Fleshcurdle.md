  _Attacks_: One of the creature's natural attacks takes a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls, only scores a critical hit on a natural 20, and only deals x2 damage on a confirmed critical hit.

  _Movement_: One of the creature's movement speeds (chosen by you) is halved.
  Most undead are susceptible to _fleshcurdle_, but amorphous creatures and creatures without flesh are immune (such as elementals, oozes, plants, gaseous or incorporeal creatures, and skeletons)."
