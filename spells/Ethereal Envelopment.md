However, a trapped creature can attack the cocoon as described in the _ethereal envelope_ spell description.

 #### Description
This spell is similar to _[[spells/Ethereal Envelope|ethereal envelope]]_, but it allows you to shunt an unwilling creature to the Ethereal Plane and seal it there within a cocoon of misty ethereal fibers. If the target fails its save, it's forced into a cataleptic meditative state as if _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_. However, each round at the end of its turn, it can attempt a Will save to _[[spells/Awaken|awaken]]_ itself from this meditation. Once the target awakens, it is considered _[[conditions/Pinned|pinned]]_, treating your caster level as your CMB and your CMD as 10 + your caster level + your ability modifier for your primary spellcasting ability score. A successful grapple combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check leaves the creature _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ rather than _pinned_ but doesn't allow it to escape. However, a trapped creature can attack the cocoon as described in the _ethereal envelope_ spell description. If the creature breaks free of the _[[spells/Ethereal Envelopment|ethereal envelopment]]_ or you dismiss the spell, the target is returned to its prior location on the Material Plane, as described for _ethereal envelope_, but if the target is conscious at the time, it doesn't spend a round asleep or _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_.
