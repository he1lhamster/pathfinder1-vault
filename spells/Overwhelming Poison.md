  "This spell increases the virulence of the targeted dose of poison, making the poison more difficult to resist. The poison is unaffected by _delay poison_, and the DC to remove it with _neutralize poison_ is increased by 5. Additionally, the poison uses its own saving throw DC or _overwhelming_ poison's DC, whichever is higher. If cast on a creature that is currently suffering from exposure to one or more doses of poison, the spell applies to one of the doses of your choice, or a random dose of poison affecting the target if you don't know what poisons are afflicting the target. If cast on a creature that is venomous, this spell affects the first dose of poison that creature delivers before the end of the spell's duration."
