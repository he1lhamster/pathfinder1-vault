  "Chanting an unholy litany, you reach out with a grasping motion toward your target and cause its heart to leap out of its chest and into your hand. A target with 200 or fewer hit points remaining that fails its saving throw is instantly reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to your caster level or its Constitution score - 1, whichever is less negative. The creature is staggered until the beginning of your next turn, at which point it dies. If the affected creature receives a _regenerate_ spell before the beginning of your next turn, the creature gains the normal benefits of that spell and, thanks to its heart's regeneration, it doesn't immediately die when your next turn begins. If a creature that dies from _death clutch_ is brought back from the dead by a _breath of life_ or _raise dead_ spell, it must also be targeted with _regenerate_ on the following round to restore its missing heart or be unable to return to life. A target with 201 or more hit points that fails its saving throw manages to keep its heart from leaping out of its chest, but it is still staggered for 1 minute and takes 1d4 points of Constitution drain and 1d4 points of Constitution bleed. Regardless of its current hit points, if the target succeeds at its Fortitude save, it is still staggered until the beginning of your next turn as it feels its heart wrenching within its chest."

 #### Description
Chanting an _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Unholy|unholy]]_ litany, you reach out with a grasping motion toward your target and cause its heart to leap out of its chest and into your hand. A target with 200 or fewer hit points remaining that fails its saving throw is instantly reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to your caster level or its Constitution score - 1, whichever is less negative. The creature is _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ until the beginning of your next turn, at which point it dies. If the affected creature receives a _[[spells/Regenerate|regenerate]]_ spell before the beginning of your next turn, the creature gains the normal benefits of that spell and, thanks to its heart's _[[universal monster rules/Regeneration|regeneration]]_, it doesn't immediately die when your next turn begins. If a creature that dies from _[[spells/Death Clutch|death clutch]]_ is brought back from the dead by a _[[spells/Breath Of Life|breath of life]]_ or _[[spells/Raise Dead|raise dead]]_ spell, it must also be targeted with _regenerate_ on the following round to restore its missing heart or be unable to return to life. A target with 201 or more hit points that fails its saving throw manages to keep its heart from leaping out of its chest, but it is still _staggered_ for 1 minute and takes 1d4 points of Constitution drain and 1d4 points of Constitution _[[universal monster rules/Bleed|bleed]]_. Regardless of its current hit points, if the target succeeds at its Fortitude save, it is still _staggered_ until the beginning of your next turn as it feels its heart wrenching within its chest.
