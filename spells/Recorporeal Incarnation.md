  "_Recorporeal incarnation_ effectively replaces the target living creature's body with that of the target corpse. The target corpse must be fresh-either dead for no more than 24 hours or appropriately preserved by an effect such as _gentle repose_. While casting the spell, you must remain in contact with the corpse while touching the living target with the focus item. As the spell is cast, the dead body's flesh unravels like ribbons to sheathe the living target, who must be within one size category of the corpse. While the spell is in effect, the focus item must remain within 30 feet of the target living creature. The living target gains the physical appearance and size of the corpse, and gains its abilities as defined in _alter self_ as well as any immunities, weapon proficiencies, weaknesses, and spell resistance the dead target had while living. The living target gains a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate the individual whose corpse is targeted by this spell. The disguise created by _recorporeal incarnation_ lasts for a number of weeks equal to your caster level, or until the focus item is moved more than 30 feet away from the living target. When the effect ends, the living target returns to its normal form, sloughing off the corpse's flesh. The greatest strength of _recorporeal incarnation_ is the difficulty of detecting it as a disguise. If subjected to _detect magic_, the living target sheds no magical aura, though the focus item gives off an aura of strong necromantic magic. _True seeing_ does not reveal the living target's true form, since the corpse's flesh magically obscures it. The spell _detect undead_ and similar effects indicate the living target is an undead creature, but the target is not truly undead, and is not affected by any other effects that target undead creatures. _Recorporeal incarnation_ does not disguise the target's alignment. If the living target of _recorporeal incarnation_ dies while the spell is in effect, the spell continues. Any _raise dead_ or similar spell cast upon that target resurrects that target, not the corpse flesh. Since _recorporeal incarnation_ destroys the majority of the target corpse's physical remains, the target corpse cannot be restored to life except by _miracle_, _resurrection_, true _resurrection_, or _wish_. _Recorporeal incarnation_ can be made permanent by a 15th-level caster using _permanency_ with a material component worth 17,500 gp."

 #### Description
_[[spells/Recorporeal Incarnation|Recorporeal incarnation]]_ effectively replaces the target living creature's body with that of the target corpse. The target corpse must be fresh-either dead for no more than 24 hours or appropriately preserved by an effect such as _[[spells/Gentle Repose|gentle repose]]_. While casting the spell, you must remain in contact with the corpse while touching the living target with the focus item. As the spell is cast, the dead body's flesh unravels like ribbons to sheathe the living target, who must be within one size category of the corpse. While the spell is in effect, the focus item must remain within 30 feet of the target living creature. The living target gains the physical appearance and size of the corpse, and gains its abilities as defined in _[[spells/Alter Self|alter self]]_ as well as any immunities, weapon proficiencies, weaknesses, and _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ the dead target had while living. The living target gains a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate the individual whose corpse is targeted by this spell. The disguise created by _recorporeal incarnation_ lasts for a number of weeks equal to your caster level, or until the focus item is moved more than 30 feet away from the living target. When the effect ends, the living target returns to its normal form, sloughing off the corpse's flesh. The greatest strength of _recorporeal incarnation_ is the difficulty of detecting it as a disguise. If subjected to _[[spells/Detect Magic|detect magic]]_, the living target sheds no magical aura, though the focus item gives off an aura of strong necromantic magic. _[[spells/True Seeing|True seeing]]_ does not reveal the living target's _[[spells/True Form|true form]]_, since the corpse's flesh magically obscures it. The spell _[[spells/Detect Undead|detect undead]]_ and similar effects indicate the living target is an undead creature, but the target is not truly undead, and is not affected by any other effects that target undead creatures. _Recorporeal incarnation_ does not disguise the target's alignment. If the living target of _recorporeal incarnation_ dies while the spell is in effect, the spell continues. Any _[[spells/Raise Dead|raise dead]]_ or similar spell cast upon that target resurrects that target, not the corpse flesh. Since _recorporeal incarnation_ destroys the majority of the target corpse's physical remains, the target corpse cannot be restored to life except by _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_, _[[spells/Resurrection|resurrection]]_, _[[spells/True Resurrection|true resurrection]]_, or _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_. _Recorporeal incarnation_ can be made permanent by a 15th-level caster using _[[spells/Permanency|permanency]]_ with a material component worth 17,500 gp.
