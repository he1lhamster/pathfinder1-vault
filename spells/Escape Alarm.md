  "You place a ward on an area that notifies you when a creature exits it. This functions as _alarm_, except as noted. It alerts you when a creature leaves, rather than enters, the area, and you can't select a password to bypass its effects. Instead, when you place an escape _alarm_, you can attune up to one additional creature per caster level to the spell. You are automatically attuned to your own escape _alarm_ and don't count against the limit. Attuned creatures can enter and exit the spell's area without triggering the _alarm_. If you select a mental _alarm_ rather than an audible one, all attuned creatures receive the mental alert when someone exits the warded area."

Instead, when you place an _[[spells/Escape Alarm|escape alarm]]_, you can attune up to one additional creature per caster level to the spell.
