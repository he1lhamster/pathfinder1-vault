  "You create two globes of lightning that fly in whichever direction you indicate.

These globes fly at a rate of 20 feet per round and have perfect maneuverability. Wind does not affect a flying sphere's course.
  If a globe enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of electricity damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates the damage. Creatures wearing metal armor take a -4 penalty on this saving throw.
  Each globe moves as long as you actively direct it (it's a move action for you to direct all the spheres created by a single casting of this spell); otherwise they stay at rest. These globes have no mass and cannot push aside unwilling creatures or move solid objects. A _ball lightning_ globe winks out if it exceeds the spell's range."

 #### Description
You create two globes of lightning that fly in whichever direction you indicate. For every 4 caster levels above 7th, you create an additional globe of lightning (3 globes at 11th, 4 globes at 15th, to the maximum of 5 globes at 19th). These globes fly at a rate of 20 feet per round and have perfect maneuverability. Wind does not affect a flying sphere's course.

  Each globe moves as long as you actively direct it (it's a move action for you to direct all the spheres created by a single casting of this spell); otherwise they stay at rest. These globes have no mass and cannot push aside unwilling creatures or move solid objects. A _[[spells/Ball Lightning|ball lightning]]_ globe winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.
