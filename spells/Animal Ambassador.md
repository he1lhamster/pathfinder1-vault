  "You compel a single animal to travel to a spot you designate and deliver a message to a creature you identify. This spell is similar to _animal messenger_, but can affect larger animals. In addition, the target animal is temporarily _awaken_ed to sentience (as the _awaken_ spell) for the duration of this spell, and it can use its increased mental acuity to come up with creative solutions to overcome obstacles to delivering its message. The _awaken_ed target animal speaks any one language you know. In addition, you can imbue the animal with up to 5 ranks in any of the following skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nobility), Linguistics, or Sense Motive. It treats any of these skills that are class skills for you as class skills. The number of ranks you imbue in any of these skills can't exceed the target animal's Hit Dice nor the number of ranks you possess in that skill. The message you send with your _animal ambassador_ can be a verbal message, which the _awaken_ed target animal can speak using its own voice or deliver using your voice. It can engage in conversation using its own intellect, knowledge, and linguistic abilities. The _animal ambassador_ is loyal to you, but it is otherwise susceptible to mind-affecting effects like any other creature. You can also send your _animal ambassador_ with an object or container that is within its physical ability to carry, making it deliver the contents to the target of your intended message. If the object it is given to carry is poisonous, trapped, or otherwise inherently dangerous (even if it would normally be dangerous only to the creature receiving it rather than the animal), or if you or your allies attack the target animal, the _animal ambassador_ spell fails and the animal becomes hostile toward you. The _animal ambassador_ intelligently but single-mindedly attempts to deliver the message to its intended target, and you can't task it with other tasks like fighting, scouting, searching for traps, and so on. It leaves on its delivery once it receives its message. Once the _animal ambassador_ has located its target and delivered its message (and object, if desired), its enhanced mental abilities fade within 2d6 minutes. The spell then ends, even if its duration hasn't elapsed."

 #### Description
You compel a single animal to travel to a spot you designate and deliver a _[[spells/Message|message]]_ to a creature you _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_. This spell is similar to _[[spells/Animal Messenger|animal messenger]]_, but can affect larger animals. In addition, the target animal is temporarily awakened to sentience (as the _[[spells/Awaken|awaken]]_ spell) for the duration of this spell, and it can use its increased mental acuity to come up with creative solutions to overcome obstacles to delivering its _message_. The awakened target animal speaks any one language you know. In addition, you can imbue the animal with up to 5 ranks in any of the following skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nobility), Linguistics, or Sense Motive. It treats any of these skills that are class skills for you as class skills. The number of ranks you imbue in any of these skills can't exceed the target animal's Hit Dice nor the number of ranks you possess in that skill. The _message_ you send with your _[[spells/Animal Ambassador|animal ambassador]]_ can be a verbal _message_, which the awakened target animal can speak using its own voice or deliver using your voice. It can engage in conversation using its own intellect, knowledge, and linguistic abilities. The _animal ambassador_ is loyal to you, but it is otherwise susceptible to mind-affecting effects like any other creature. You can also send your _animal ambassador_ with an object or container that is within its physical ability to carry, making it deliver the contents to the target of your intended _message_. If the object it is given to carry is poisonous, trapped, or otherwise inherently dangerous (even if it would normally be dangerous only to the creature receiving it rather than the animal), or if you or your allies attack the target animal, the _animal ambassador_ spell fails and the animal becomes hostile toward you. The _animal ambassador_ intelligently but single-mindedly attempts to deliver the _message_ to its intended target, and you can't task it with other tasks like fighting, scouting, searching for traps, and so on. It leaves on its delivery once it receives its _message_. Once the _animal ambassador_ has located its target and delivered its _message_ (and object, if desired), its enhanced mental abilities fade within 2d6 minutes. The spell then ends, even if its duration hasn't elapsed.
