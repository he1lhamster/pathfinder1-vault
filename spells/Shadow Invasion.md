  "Using a slashing motion with the spell's focus as part of the casting of _shadow_ invasion_, you cut open a rift to the Plane of Shadow that fills a 30-foot area with _shadow_y energies. This area is stationary and becomes dark and gloomy, reducing the light level by one step (as darkness). Certain spells are enhanced within the area; spells of the _shadow_ subschool that have reduced effects when disbelieved (such as _shadow_ evocation) have their reduced effects increased by 20% (to a maximum of 90%) when determining their effects on targets within the area of _shadow_ invasion_. In addition, the rift created by _shadow_ invasion_ has a chance of attracting attention from the other side, and the spell can be inverted to bring these watchers through. When _shadow_ invasion_ is dismissed as a standard action, there is a chance that a single evangelist kyton (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary_ 185) will be summoned under the caster's command (as per _summon monster_ V). This chance is 5% for every full round that _shadow_ invasion_ was active. If the caster level of _shadow_ invasion_ is 16th or greater, this effect summons an interlocutorB3 kyton instead. A kyton summoned this way remains for a number of rounds equal to what the remaining duration of _shadow_ invasion_ would have been had it not been dismissed. Successfully summoning a kyton this way is a lawful and evil act, as though casting a spell with the lawful and evil descriptors."

 #### Description
Using a slashing motion with the spell's focus as part of the casting of _[[spells/Shadow Invasion|shadow invasion]]_, you cut open a rift to the Plane of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|Shadow]]_ that fills a 30-foot area with shadowy energies. This area is stationary and becomes dark and gloomy, reducing the light level by one step (as _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_). Certain spells are enhanced within the area; spells of the _shadow_ subschool that have reduced effects when disbelieved (such as _[[spells/Shadow Evocation|shadow evocation]]_) have their reduced effects increased by 20% (to a maximum of 90%) when determining their effects on targets within the area of _shadow invasion_. In addition, the rift created by _shadow invasion_ has a chance of attracting attention from the other side, and the spell can be inverted to bring these watchers through. When _shadow invasion_ is dismissed as a standard action, there is a chance that a single evangelist _[[monsters/Kyton|kyton]]_ (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 185) will be summoned under the caster's _[[spells/Command|command]]_ (as per _[[spells/Summon Monster V|summon monster V]]_). This chance is 5% for every full round that _shadow invasion_ was active. If the caster level of _shadow invasion_ is 16th or greater, this effect summons an interlocutorB3 _kyton_ instead. A _kyton_ summoned this way remains for a number of rounds equal to what the remaining duration of _shadow invasion_ would have been had it not been dismissed. Successfully summoning a _kyton_ this way is a lawful and evil act, as though casting a spell with the lawful and evil descriptors.
