  "This spell functions similarly to _alter self_, except for the following differences. You assume the exact form of a deceased Small or Medium creature of the humanoid type.

The creature whose form you assume must be dead and you must have access to its fresh corpse (either dead less than 24 hours, or preserved via _gentle repose_ or similar effect).
