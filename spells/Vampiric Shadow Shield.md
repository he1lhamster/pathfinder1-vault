  "This spell wreathes you in shadowy energy and damages those that make melee attacks against you. Any creature that strikes you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of negative energy damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15).

  When an attacker takes damage from the spell, you heal a number of hit points equal to 25% of the damage the spell dealt."
