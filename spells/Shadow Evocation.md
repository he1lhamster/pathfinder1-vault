  "You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to cast a quasi-real, illusory version of a sorcerer or wizard evocation spell of 4th level or lower.

 #### Description
You tap energy from the Plane of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|Shadow]]_ to cast a quasi-real, illusory version of a _[[classes/Sorcerer|sorcerer]]_ or _[[classes/Wizard|wizard]]_ evocation spell of 4th level or lower. Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless an affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur. If recognized as a _[[spells/Shadow Evocation|shadow evocation]]_, a damaging spell deals only one-fifth (20%) damage. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save (or _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_) that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to _shadow evocation_'s level (5th) rather than the spell's normal level.
  Nondamaging effects have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they have no effect.
