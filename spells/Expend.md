  "You cause all creatures in the affected area to use up one or more of their limited-use magical abilities without any actual effect.

You cause all creatures in the affected area to use up one or more of their limited-use magical abilities without any actual effect. A limited-use magical ability is any supernatural or spelllike ability which a creature can only activate a certain number of times during a set interval (3/day, 1/hour, etc.). The spell does not affect abilities which the creature can use at will or which are constant. It also does not apply to magical items or anything else external to a creature. A creature in the spell's area must make a Will saving throw or _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ a single use of one of its abilities.
