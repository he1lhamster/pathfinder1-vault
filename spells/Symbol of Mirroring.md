  "This spell functions as _symbol of death_, except it instead creates one illusory duplicate of each creature within 60 feet of the symbol. These duplicates function as _mirror image_, moving with the original creatures and mimicking their movements, sounds, and actions exactly. If an illusory double is destroyed, a new one appears on the creature's turn. The images last for as long as a creature remains within 60 feet of the symbol, and for 1 round/level thereafter. Once triggered, the symbol remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.
  _Symbol of mirroring_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell by a caster of 10th level or higher for the cost of 5,000 gp."
