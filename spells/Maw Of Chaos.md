  "This spell creates a rip in reality that plunges into the interspatial vortices that constantly churn with the raw destructive chaos of the Abyss. Each round at the beginning of your turn, the _maw of chaos_ attempts a drag combat maneuver check against every creature within 40 feet, using your caster level plus your primary spellcasting ability modifier in place of a CMB. If a creature is dragged into a _maw of chaos_, the area erupts in a surge of chaotic energy and the creature takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level. Only one such eruption can occur per round. Creatures dragged adjacent to the _maw of chaos_ become entangled by the frayed strands of reality being torn apart at the rim of the _maw of chaos_. Escape requires a successful Escape Artist check or grapple check against a DC equal to 10 plus the spell's save DC. Every creature without the chaotic subtype that ends its turn adjacent to a _maw of chaos_ takes 2 points of damage to each ability score. Creatures with the lawful subtype take double this amount of damage; creatures with the chaotic subtype take no damage. Calling, summoning, and teleportation effects used within 30 feet of the _maw of chaos_ or that cause a creature to appear within 30 feet of a _maw of chaos_ are redirected, causing the creature to arrive adjacent to the _maw of chaos_ rather than at its intended destination. Unattended objects (including dead bodies) adjacent to the _maw of chaos_ are drawn into it and affected as by _disintegrate_ at the beginning of the caster's next turn."
