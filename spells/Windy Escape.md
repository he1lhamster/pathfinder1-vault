You gain DR 10/magic against this attack and are immune to any poison, sneak attacks, or critical hit effect from that attack. You cannot use _windy escape_ against an attack of opportunity you provoked by casting a spell, using a spell-like ability, or using any other magical ability that provokes an attack of opportunity when used."
