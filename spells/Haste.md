  "The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra _speed_ has several effects.
  When making a full attack action, a _haste_d creature may make one extra attack with one natural or manufactured weapon. The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a _speed_ weapon, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.) A _haste_d creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.
  All of the _haste_d creature's modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal _speed_ using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased _speed_. Multiple _haste_ effects don't stack. _Haste_ dispels and counters _slow_."

 #### Description
The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects.
  When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with one natural or manufactured weapon. The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a speed weapon, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.) A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 _[[feats/Dodge|dodge]]_ bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose _dodge_ bonuses.
  All of the hasted creature's modes of movement (including land movement, _[[universal monster rules/Burrow|burrow]]_, _[[universal monster rules/Climb|climb]]_, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased speed. Multiple _[[spells/Haste|haste]]_ effects don't stack. _Haste_ dispels and counters _[[spells/Slow|slow]]_.
