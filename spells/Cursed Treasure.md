  "You touch a piece of treasure or container filled with treasure and place a terrible curse upon it, choosing from any option available with _bestow curse_. The next creature to take the treasure or remove items from the container is affected by the curse, unless it succeeds at a Will save (spell resistance applies). If you are the next creature to take the treasure or get objects from the container, though, the spell discharges harmlessly instead."
