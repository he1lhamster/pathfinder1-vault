  "You make yourself-including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment-appear translucent like a ghost.

 #### Description
You make yourself-including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment-appear translucent like a _[[monsters/Ghost|ghost]]_. Any mundane or magical disguise on you is affected by this illusion as well; for example, if you are disguised as the _[[npcs/King|king]]_ or a _[[monsters/Sahuagin|sahuagin]]_, you look like a ghostly version of the _king_ or a _sahuagin_. Your ghostly form may have a pale green, blue, or violet coloration, or a muted version of your normal appearance.
  The spell does not actually make you ghostly or provide any _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ abilities. If you choose, the illusion can make you appear to float slightly above the ground, though you are actually still on the ground. A creature that interacts with the glamer gets a Will save to recognize it as an illusion.
