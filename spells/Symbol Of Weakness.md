  "This spell functions like _symbol of death_, except that every creature within 60 feet of a _symbol of weakness_ instead suffers crippling weakness that deals 3d6 points of Strength damage.
  Unlike _symbol of death_, _symbol of weakness_ has no hit point limit; once triggered, a _symbol of weakness_ simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level. A creature can only be affected by this symbol once.
  _Note_: Magic traps such as _symbol of weakness_ are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for _symbol of weakness_."
