  "This spell functions as _symbol of death_, except that all creatures within 40 feet of the _symbol of dispelling_ are instead affected as if by the area dispel function of _greater dispel magic_.
  Attempt a dispel check when casting _symbol of dispelling_.
  Once the symbol is triggered, apply the result of that check to each creature in the area, as well as each object that is the target of one or more spells. Unlike _symbol of death_, _symbol of dispelling_ grants no saving throws, and it is not subject to spell resistance."
