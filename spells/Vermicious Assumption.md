  "You call a single vermlek demon (_Lords of Chaos_ 54) to invade and inhabit the body of the target corpse, taking on its likeness. The vermlek can remain on the Material Plane indefinitely as long as it has a body to inhabit; however, if it remains outside of a host for more than 1 minute, it's banished back to the Abyss. The vermlek's initial attitude towards you is friendly, but you must succeed at an opposed Charisma check to convince it to obey your commands, similar to a charmed creature. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on this Charisma check if you offer it a fresh humanoid corpse to inhabit."
