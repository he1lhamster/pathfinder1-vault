  "This spell functions as per _suggestion_, except the target can pass on the enchantment to other targets. The target is compelled to communicate your _suggestion_ to another creature, forcing the new target to attempt a saving throw as if it were the initial target. If a secondary target successfully saves, the _suggestion_ effect on the initial target isn't negated. If a secondary target fails, it is placed under the same compulsion as the initial target and can further spread the _suggestion_. This spell can affect a total number of Hit Dice of creatures equal to your caster level. Creatures that save against this spell cannot be affected by that particular casting of contagious _suggestion_ for 24 hours."
