  You determine which allies you want to _teleport_ at the time of casting; these allies have 1 round to decide to allow or refuse your spell, and they _teleport_ immediately upon accepting.

If you are in combat and your allies were not, your allies may roll initiative upon arrival but are not considered flat-footed even though they have not taken any actions.
