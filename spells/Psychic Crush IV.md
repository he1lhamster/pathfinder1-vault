  "This functions as _psychic crush I_, but the target takes 9d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per caster level on a successful Fortitude or Will save. The target does not receive any saving throw bonus because of its hit points. If it is at fewer than half its total hit points, it doesn't gain a Fortitude save to resist this spell but instead proceeds as if it had automatically failed its Fortitude save.
