  "This spell functions as _contingency_, but you invest a spell whose level doesn't exceed one-quarter of your level (rounded down, maximum spell level 3rd) into one of your implements that holds 2 or more points of mental focus. The spell's school must match that of the implement, and the spell must be one that affects only your person.

When you refresh your mental focus, _talismanic implement_ ends automatically, even if the duration hasn't elapsed. Unlike _contingency_, you may have multiple _talismanic implement_s simultaneously, though a single implement can hold only one _talismanic implement_ spell, and if you have any _talismanic implement_s, you can't have any other kind of _contingency_ in effect."

 #### Description
This spell functions as _[[spells/Contingency|contingency]]_, but you invest a spell whose level doesn't exceed one-quarter of your level (rounded down, maximum spell level 3rd) into one of your implements that holds 2 or more points of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Mental Focus|mental focus]]_. The spell's school must match that of the implement, and the spell must be one that affects only your person. Casting _[[spells/Talismanic Implement|talismanic implement]]_ reduces the selected implement's _mental focus_ by 2, including for the purposes of determining the effects of resonant powers. When you refresh your _mental focus_, _talismanic implement_ ends automatically, even if the duration hasn't elapsed. Unlike _contingency_, you may have multiple talismanic implements simultaneously, though a single implement can hold only one _talismanic implement_ spell, and if you have any talismanic implements, you can't have any other kind of _contingency_ in effect.
