  "This spell creates an area of intense blackness, as _deeper darkness_, but filled with unseen chewing teeth and ravenous maws. Any creatures beginning its turn within the _hungry darkness_ is gnawed and slashed by these unseen fangs of force, dealing 3d6 points of force damage and 2 points of Constitution damage per round. Once a creature leaves the cloud, it continues to take 1d6 points of bleed damage each round until it receives magical healing or enters an area of bright light. Spell resistance can prevent damage from the _hungry darkness_ but not against the darkness it creates."
