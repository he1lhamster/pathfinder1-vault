  "Your targets perceive intimidation and threats as laughably absurd. A character attempting to intimidate your targets is instead perceived as having exaggerated facial features or babbling and awkward speech. Effects that impose fear conditions become objects of ridicule, with the targets making fun of the source of the object as it attempts to scare them. _Absurdity_ protects your targets from gaining lesser fear conditions (spooked, shaken, and scared), granting them immunity to spooked and a 50% chance to negate shaken or scared conditions instead of gaining them from any effect, including uses of the Intimidate skill to demoralize. Any other effect related to a spell or ability that generates fear (such as dying from a _phantasmal_ killer) affects them normally, and effects that ignore immunity to fear also ignore _absurdity_. However, target creatures also have serious difficulty noticing potential threats; they take a -10 penalty on Sense Motive checks to avoid surprise or to notice that a creature is actively threatening or malicious and a -2 penalty on initiative checks. The spell doesn't prevent spells or effects that provide early warning or a form of danger sense (like _anticipate_ peril or _find_ traps) from alerting the affected character to danger."

 #### Description
Your targets perceive intimidation and threats as laughably absurd. A character attempting to intimidate your targets is instead perceived as having exaggerated facial features or babbling and awkward speech. Effects that impose _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ conditions become objects of ridicule, with the targets making fun of the source of the object as it attempts to _[[spells/Scare|scare]]_ them. _[[spells/Absurdity|Absurdity]]_ protects your targets from gaining lesser _fear_ conditions (spooked, _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_, and scared), granting them _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to spooked and a 50% chance to negate _shaken_ or scared conditions instead of gaining them from any effect, including uses of the Intimidate skill to demoralize. Any other effect related to a spell or ability that generates _fear_ (such as _[[conditions/Dying|dying]]_ from a _[[spells/Phantasmal Killer|phantasmal killer]]_) affects them normally, and effects that ignore _immunity_ to _fear_ also ignore _absurdity_. However, target creatures also have serious difficulty noticing potential threats; they take a -10 penalty on Sense Motive checks to avoid surprise or to notice that a creature is actively threatening or malicious and a -2 penalty on initiative checks. The spell doesn't prevent spells or effects that provide early warning or a form of danger sense (like _[[spells/Anticipate Peril|anticipate peril]]_ or _[[spells/Find Traps|find traps]]_) from alerting the affected character to danger.
