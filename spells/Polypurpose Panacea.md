  "This creates one of several cantrip-level effects relating to your health, well-being, and entertainment. The panacea has no side effects (for example, the intoxication panacea does not cause a hangover). When you use _polypurpose panacea_, choose one of the following effects.
  Analgesic: You do not feel minor aches and pains, such as from arthritis, a cold, or a hangover, for 1 hour. For the duration, you gain a +2 resistance bonus against pain-related spells.
  Clarity: You get a +1 competence bonus on a single attack roll, saving throw, or skill check within 1 minute. You must choose to use the bonus before making the roll to which it applies.
  Hallucination: You have pleasant hallucinations for 1 hour, such as wandering lights, music, playful surreal animals, and so on. You can tell these are not real, but they are distracting, and you take a -2 penalty on Perception checks for the duration.
  Intoxication: You feel comfortably intoxicated for 1 hour, as if you had a few alcoholic beverages.
  _Lucid_ Dream: If you take this panacea within 1 hour of going to _sleep_, you have a lucid dream that is under your control and lasts for an hour.
  Resistance: You gain a +1 resistance bonus on saves for 1 minute.
  Sleep: You enter a pleasant and restful _sleep_ for at least 1 hour unless wakened. If you would normally begin _sleep_ing at this time, when the panacea ends you continue _sleep_ing normally.
  Sobriety: You become completely sober for 1 hour, negating any penalties to your actions for being drunk (_GameMastery Guide_ 237). Magical and alchemical methods (such as _detect_ poison) still _detect_ you as inebriated. Time spent under the effect of this panacea do not count toward the time necessary to sober up (it merely delays your intoxication).
  Tenacity: You gain 1 temporary hit point for 1 minute.
  Wakefulness: You remain awake for 2 hours without feeling _sleep_y, and without side effects such as jitteriness. You gain a +5 resistance bonus against _sleep_-related spells such as _lullaby_ and _sleep_. This use of the panacea merely delays your need for _sleep_ and does not count as rest or _sleep_. You can use it multiple times in succession, but as each effect wears off, you are as tired as you would be had you not used the panacea."
