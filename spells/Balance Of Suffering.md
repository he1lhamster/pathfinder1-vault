  "You borrow life force from a living creature and infuse it into another living creature, potentially wreaking destruction on the former and bolstering the life of the latter. Choose an initial target, which must be alive, and a secondary target, which must be alive or undead. The initial target is dealt a number of points of damage equal to 9d6 + 1 point per caster level. A successful Will saving throw halves the damage dealt. The target might die from damage even if it succeeds on its saving throw. If the secondary target is a living creature, it regains a number of hit points equal to the amount of damage taken by the initial target. If the secondary target is undead, it instead takes an amount of damage equal to that dealt to the initial target. The secondary target can halve the healing imparted or harm inflicted to it with a successful Will saving throw (although a secondary target receiving healing can forgo this saving throw as normal). This spell is subject to the spell resistance of the initial target; if the secondary target is unwilling, this spell is also subject to the secondary target's spell resistance. If the spell does not penetrate the initial target's spell resistance, it fizzles with no effect. If it does not penetrate the secondary target's spell resistance, the initial target is still harmed as described, but the secondary target is not healed or harmed."

 #### Description
You borrow life force from a living creature and infuse it into another living creature, potentially wreaking _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ on the former and _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Bolstering|bolstering]]_ the life of the latter. Choose an initial target, which must be alive, and a secondary target, which must be alive or undead. The initial target is dealt a number of points of damage equal to 9d6 + 1 point per caster level. A successful Will saving throw halves the damage dealt. The target might die from damage even if it succeeds on its saving throw. If the secondary target is a living creature, it regains a number of hit points equal to the amount of damage taken by the initial target. If the secondary target is undead, it instead takes an amount of damage equal to that dealt to the initial target. The secondary target can halve the healing imparted or _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ inflicted to it with a successful Will saving throw (although a secondary target receiving healing can forgo this saving throw as normal). This spell is subject to the _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ of the initial target; if the secondary target is unwilling, this spell is also subject to the secondary target's _spell resistance_. If the spell does not penetrate the initial target's _spell resistance_, it fizzles with no effect. If it does not penetrate the secondary target's _spell resistance_, the initial target is still harmed as described, but the secondary target is not healed or harmed.
