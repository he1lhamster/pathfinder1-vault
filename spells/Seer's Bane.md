  "This spell functions as _nondetection_, except that those who cast divination spells targeting the warded creature or item must succeed on a caster level check (DC = 15 + your caster level). If the caster of the divination fails, deadly magical feedback strikes at him, dealing 1d6 points of electricity damage per 2 caster levels you have (maximum 10d6 at 20th level). Alternatively, if you cast _bestow curse_, _chaos hammer_, _contagion_, _holy smite_, order's wrath, _poison_, or _unholy blight_ in the round immediately following seer's bane, you can replace the spell's damaging effect with the effects of that second spell (the divination's caster-and potentially those around him-save as normal for the modifying spell)."
