  "You restore temporary life to a body that has been dead for less than 48 hours. The spell lasts for 24 hours, after which the target dies again.

 #### Description
You restore temporary life to a body that has been dead for less than 48 hours. The spell lasts for 24 hours, after which the target dies again. The target gains 1 permanent negative level while under the effect of this spell; this negative level goes away when the target dies or is permanently raised from the dead (such as with _[[spells/Raise Dead|raise dead]]_). The target still counts as a dead corpse (but not undead) for the purpose of spells that revive dead creatures, so a _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ can cast _raise dead_ or a similar spell on the target even while this spell is active. Once a creature has been revived with _[[spells/Temporary Resurrection|temporary resurrection]]_, this spell cannot be used on it again until it is permanently raised from the dead.
