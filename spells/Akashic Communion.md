  "You attempt to obtain a glimpse of some specific event from the Akashic Record (_Occult Adventures_ 244), the extraplanar repository of all experiences that have ever occurred. This allows you to attempt one Knowledge skill check of your choice per 3 caster levels you have, each with a +10 insight bonus. You are treated as trained in any Knowledge skills used for these checks, and can use this spell to reroll a Knowledge skill check you have already failed. The GM rolls these Knowledge checks in secret, as the Akashic Record is incredibly remote, and impressions gleaned from the distant repository are sometimes skewed when received. On a natural 1, the resulting answer is wildly inaccurate. This spell provides experiential guidance based on your ability to understand the flashes of insight gleaned from the Akashic Record, rather than the perfect knowledge available to those who travel to the extraplanar repository of knowledge. If you lag, discuss the answers, or go off to do anything else, the spell ends. Once you have used this spell to gain information on a specific topic or event, you cannot use it for Knowledge checks regarding that topic or event again until you have gained a caster level."
