  "You can avoid being _detect_ed when you are on the edges of some divination spells' ranges. Whenever you would normally be within the area of effect of a _detect_ion spell (such as _detect_ magic_, _detect_ evil_, or _detect_ undead), the area of effect is reduced by half for the purposes of the spell's caster _detect_ing you or your possessions. The caster of the _detect_ spell is unaware of this reduction in her spell's range; she simply does not _detect_ you."

 #### Description
You can avoid being detected when you are on the edges of some _[[spells/Divination|divination]]_ spells' ranges. Whenever you would normally be within the area of effect of a detection spell (such as _[[spells/Detect Magic|detect magic]]_, _[[spells/Detect Evil|detect evil]]_, or _[[spells/Detect Undead|detect undead]]_), the area of effect is reduced by half for the purposes of the spell's caster detecting you or your possessions. The caster of the detect spell is unaware of this reduction in her spell's range; she simply does not detect you.
