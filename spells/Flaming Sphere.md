  "A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point and burns those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of fire damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates that damage. A _flaming sphere_ rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall. It ignites flammable substances it touches and illuminates the same area as a torch would.
  The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns. It can be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. A _flaming sphere_ winks out if it exceeds the spell's range."

 #### Description
A _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Burning|burning]]_ globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point and burns those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or _[[spells/Jump|jump]]_ up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of fire damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates that damage. A _[[spells/Flaming Sphere|flaming sphere]]_ rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall. It ignites flammable substances it touches and illuminates the same area as a _[[items/Mundane/Torch|torch]]_ would.
  The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns. It can be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. A _flaming sphere_ winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.
