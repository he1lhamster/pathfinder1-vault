  "You touch a creature and temporarily absorb its knowledge for yourself. If the target fails its saving throw, you can sort through its lore and memories. You can retrieve one answer to a specific question per minute, as through sifting through the creature's surface thoughts with _detect thoughts_. Alternatively, you can tap into the target's learned experiences and attempt one Knowledge check in a skill in which the target has at least 1 rank, using the target's total skill modifier.
