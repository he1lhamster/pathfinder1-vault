 #### Description
You mend the target's injuries, curing 3d8 hit points + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15) as _[[spells/Cure Serious Wounds|cure serious wounds]]_, but leaving its body laced with a subtle toxin that remains inert until you activate it. A target that decides to attempt the Will save and succeeds is healed for half (as _cure serious wounds_) and negates the toxin. Otherwise, you can activate the toxin by concentrating on the spell as a standard action, at which point the victim takes 1d3 points of Strength damage per round for 6 rounds. Once the poison is active, the target can attempt a Fortitude save each round to negate that round's damage and end the affliction. If you don't trigger the poison for 1 hour, the spell ends and leaves the target unharmed. _[[spells/Detect Poison|Detect poison]]_ reveals an inert _[[spells/Poisonous Balm|poisonous balm]]_ only if the caster succeeds at a caster level check against a DC equal to 15 + your caster level. Attempts to _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ _poisonous balm_ with a skill check incorrectly _identify_ it as _cure serious wounds_ (see the ruse descriptor on page 192). A fooled viewer mistakes _poisonous balm_'s aura as the lingering aura of an instantaneous effect.
