  "This spell creates a semi-visible psychic manifestation that allows a creature to replace a missing body part or parts. This could be as simple as a missing finger or toe or as complex as one or more limbs or even a set of wings. The creature can use these ghostly appendages exactly as if they were the creature's own limbs, including any natural attacks or other special abilities.

Mermaid's Tail: The target grows a phantom tail, granting it a swim speed of 60 feet. **Phantom Wings**: The target grows phantom wings, granting it a fly speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability)."
