 #### Description
You curse one living creature with a chance of instant and unexpected death. When you cast this spell, your hand seethes with eerie _[[monsters/Gray|gray]]_ fire. You must succeed at a melee touch attack to touch the target, at which time the fire buries itself within the target's body and disappears. On the round you touch the creature and once per minute thereafter, roll 1d100. On a result of 01-05, the spell is triggered and the creature takes 8d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level; the creature can attempt a saving throw to reduce the damage to 2d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level. On a result of 06-100, nothing happens. Once the spell is triggered or if the duration expires before it triggers, the magic ends and no further 1d100 rolls are made. If the target has _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_, a caster level check is made when you succeed at the touch attack. A creature can be affected by only one instance of this spell at a time. The untriggered spell can be removed with _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_, _[[spells/Remove Curse|remove curse]]_, or similar effects.
