  "If you successfully counterspell a 3rd-level or lower level spell (through either _dispel magic_ or normal means) while _spell absorption_ is in effect, you absorb the countered spell and use it to regain spells you have already cast. If you're a wizard, you regain the use of any single spell that you have cast since the last time you prepared spells. If you're a sorcerer, you regain a single spell slot. The spell recovered or spell slot regained must be of an equal level or lower than the spell you counterspelled."
