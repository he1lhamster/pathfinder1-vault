  "You expand your consciousness in an attempt to tap into the perfect knowledge contained within the Akashic Record. Such a connection is incredibly difficult to create and maintain, and it can be almost impossible to know at the time of the casting what knowledge will be gained. The information contained within the Akashic Record can be overwhelming when accessed in this fashion, so your mind partitions it away until needed. For the next day, you can activate the knowledge gained from the Akashic Record as a free action; when you do so, you gain a circumstance bonus equal to your caster level on all skill checks, ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and combat maneuver checks for 1 minute. At the end of this time, the overwhelming nature of the Akashic Record assaults your psyche, causing you to be stunned for 2 rounds and then sickened for 1 minute."

 #### Description
You expand your consciousness in an attempt to tap into the perfect knowledge contained within the Akashic Record. Such a connection is incredibly difficult to create and maintain, and it can be almost impossible to know at the time of the casting what knowledge will be gained. The information contained within the Akashic Record can be overwhelming when accessed in this fashion, so your mind partitions it away until needed. For the next day, you can activate the knowledge gained from the Akashic Record as a free action; when you do so, you gain a circumstance bonus equal to your caster level on all skill checks, ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and combat maneuver checks for 1 minute. At the end of this time, the overwhelming nature of the Akashic Record assaults your psyche, causing you to be _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_ for 2 rounds and then _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ for 1 minute.
