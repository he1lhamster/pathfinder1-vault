  "You polish a metal item until it is reflective enough to be used as a mirror. This does not prevent the item from later damage or corrosion that would ruin the mirrored surface.
  The spell can be cast only on a metal item with a fairly smooth and contiguous surface, such as a breastplate, a helm, a shield, or a sword, but not a mace, chainmail, or scale mail."
