  "You lend the nature of adamantine, cold iron, or silver to the targeted weapons, depending on which component you used, with the following effects. _Adamantine_: The weapons overcome DR/adamantine and ignore hardness of less than 20. _Cold Iron_: The weapons overcome DR/cold iron. _Silver_: The weapons overcome DR/silver.

If you grant the target weapons the property of cold iron, the spell lasts half as long as normal."
