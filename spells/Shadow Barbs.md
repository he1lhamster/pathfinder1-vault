  "This spell, developed originally by priests of Zon-Kuthon in Nidal's early years, has recently crossed the boundary between divine and arcane magic. Although it still bears some of the stigma of being associated with the Midnight Lord, it's rapidly becoming a favorite spell of magi and other martially minded arcane spellcasters.
  When you cast this spell, you create a _shadow_y spiked chain that shimmers and pulses with darkness. The chain exists as long as you carry it; if you ever drop the chain, give it to another, or are disarmed, it immediately vanishes and the spell's duration ends.
  The chain radiates darkness in a 10-foot-radius spread around you, reducing the illumination level in this area by one step, but not below the level of dim light.
  You can wield the _shadow_ barbs_ as a spiked chain as if you were fully proficient with spiked chains. Any additional abilities or feats that you possess that apply to spiked chains apply to the _shadow_ barbs_ as well. The weapon functions as a _+2 vicious spiked chain_. Its enhancement bonus increases to +3 at caster level 11th, to +4 at caster level 15th, and finally to +5 at caster level 19th. When the spell effect ends, you can make a Will save against the spell-if successful, all of the damage caused to you by the _shadow_ barbs_' vicious weapon quality vanishes, unless you are dead or unconscious at the time the spell ends, in which case you automatically fail this Will save and the vicious weapon damage remains."

 #### Description
This spell, developed originally by priests of Zon-Kuthon in Nidal's early years, has recently crossed the boundary between divine and arcane magic. Although it still bears some of the stigma of being associated with the Midnight Lord, it's rapidly becoming a favorite spell of magi and other martially minded arcane spellcasters.
  When you cast this spell, you create a shadowy _[[items/Weapon/Spiked chain|spiked chain]]_ that shimmers and pulses with _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_. The chain exists as long as you carry it; if you ever drop the chain, give it to another, or are disarmed, it immediately vanishes and the spell's duration ends.
  The chain radiates _darkness_ in a 10-foot-radius spread around you, reducing the illumination level in this area by one step, but not below the level of dim light.
  You can wield the _[[spells/Shadow Barbs|shadow barbs]]_ as a _spiked chain_ as if you were fully proficient with spiked chains. Any additional abilities or feats that you possess that apply to spiked chains apply to the _shadow barbs_ as well. The weapon functions as a +2 _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_ _spiked chain_. Its enhancement bonus increases to +3 at caster level 11th, to +4 at caster level 15th, and finally to +5 at caster level 19th. When the spell effect ends, you can make a Will save against the spell-if successful, all of the damage caused to you by the _shadow barbs_' _vicious_ weapon quality vanishes, unless you are dead or _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_ at the time the spell ends, in which case you automatically fail this Will save and the _vicious_ weapon damage remains.
