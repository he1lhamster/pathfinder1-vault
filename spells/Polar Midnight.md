 #### Description
You plunge an area into the brutal chill of the arctic night.
  Illumination conditions are dropped by two steps (though only to _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_, not supernatural _darkness_), and all creatures in the area take 5d6 points of cold damage and 1d6 points of Dexterity damage per round. A successful Fortitude save each round negates the Dexterity damage but not the cold damage.
  Any creature that doesn't move on its turn becomes encased in a sheath of ice equivalent to _[[spells/Wall Of Ice|wall of ice]]_, is _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_, and cannot breathe. Corpses in the area for longer than 1 round are transmuted into solid ice; reviving the icy corpse requires _[[spells/True Resurrection|true resurrection]]_, _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_, or _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_. As a move action, you may move the area of effect up to 10 feet in any direction.
