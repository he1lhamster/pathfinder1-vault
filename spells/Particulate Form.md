  "The targets' physical forms undergo a bizarre transformation. They look and function normally, but are composed of countless particles that separate and reconnect to remain whole. Each target gains fast healing 1 and is immune to bleed damage, critical hits, sneak attacks, and other forms of precision damage. The value of this fast healing increases by 1 at caster levels 10th, 15th, and 20th.
