A dim, blue glow surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ to spells cast by chaotic creatures, and slowing chaotic creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.
  First, each warded creature gains a +4 _[[spells/Deflection|deflection]]_ bonus to AC and a +4 _resistance_ bonus on saves. Unlike _[[spells/Protection From Chaos|protection from chaos]]_, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by chaotic creatures.

  Third, the abjuration protects you from _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_ and mental influence, just as _protection from chaos_ does.
  Finally, if a chaotic creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the attacker is slowed (Will save negates, as the _[[spells/Slow|slow]]_ spell, but against _[[spells/Shield of Law|shield of law]]_'s save DC).
