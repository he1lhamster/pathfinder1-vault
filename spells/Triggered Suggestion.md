  "This spell functions as _suggestion_, except you can use it only to specify a condition that triggers a special activity, and the subject does not remember that you made the _suggestion_.
  For example, you could use triggered _suggestion_ on a palace guard to make him attack the king the next time he and the king are alone, and the guard would not remember the _suggestion_ to do so until the trigger occurred."
