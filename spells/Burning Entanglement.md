  "This spell functions as per _entangle_, except it sets the foliage on fire. A creature that begins its turn _entangle_d by the spell takes 4d6 points of fire damage (Reflex half), and a creature that begins its turn in the area but is not _entangle_d takes 2d6 points of fire damage (Reflex negates). Smoke rising from the vines partially obscures visibility. Creatures can see things in the smoke within 5 feet clearly, but attacks against anything farther away in the smoke must contend with concealment (20% miss chance). When the spell's duration expires, the vines burn away entirely."
