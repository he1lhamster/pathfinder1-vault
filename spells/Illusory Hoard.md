  "The spell forces the target to believe that nothing in its hoard is missing or has been disturbed. This spell fools all the senses, convincing the target that its hoard feels and behaves as it should.

For the purposes of this spell, a hoard is any amount of treasure that is too big to be carried by the treasure's owner without magical tools such as _bags of holding_ or _portable holes_, such as a dragon's hoard, a king's treasury, a merchant's strongbox, or a thief's hidden cache. The material component is any item worth 10 gp or more taken from the original hoard. This item is consumed by the spell."

 #### Description
The spell forces the target to believe that nothing in its hoard is missing or has been disturbed. This spell fools all the senses, convincing the target that its hoard feels and behaves as it should. Only if the target tries to use an item from this _[[spells/Illusory Hoard|illusory hoard]]_ for some other purpose does it receive another saving throw to disbelieve the effects of the spell (a _[[classes/Wizard|wizard]]_ trying to use an illusory wand or a dragon trying to unlock a door with an illusory key). For the purposes of this spell, a hoard is any amount of treasure that is too big to be carried by the treasure's owner without magical tools such as bags of holding or portable holes, such as a dragon's hoard, a _[[npcs/King|king]]_'s treasury, a merchant's strongbox, or a thief's hidden cache. The material component is any item worth 10 gp or more taken from the original hoard. This item is consumed by the spell.
