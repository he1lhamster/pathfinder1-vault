 #### Description
You begin a _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ duel (see page 202) with a creature. This _psychic_ duel takes place on a binary mindscape (see page 235) that includes only two minds: yours and the target's. This spell ends and both minds return to their respective bodies if one of you drops below 0 hit points or if both of you agree to end the _psychic_ duel (a free action that you can perform even if it isn't your turn). Even if you cast the spell, you must succeed at a Will save to escape your own _psychic_ duel if your opponent doesn't want to allow you to leave. Spells like _[[spells/Mindscape Door|mindscape door]]_ can also free you from the mindscape (and _mindscape door_ is one of the few spells you can cast in a binary mindscape). A binary mindscape is clearly illusory, and disbelieving the illusion doesn't alter how the mindscape works.
