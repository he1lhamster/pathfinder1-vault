  "This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon or above a door or other opening measuring no more than 20 square feet/level in size. When the casting is completed, the symbol immediately triggers, glowing visibly and sealing the door or opening with an invisible barrier of force equivalent to a _wall of force_. Destroying the symbol ends the effect, though destroying it once the symbol has been activated requires destroying the _wall of force_ first. Once triggered, the wall remains for 10 minutes per caster level.
  When scribing a _symbol of sealing_, you can specify a password or phrase that allows a creature speaking it to bypass the seal and pass through the opening. You can also attune any number of creatures to the _symbol of sealing_, but doing this extends the casting time as described under _symbol of death_ (Core _Rulebook_ 355). However, the force wall created by the symbol blocks attacks and line of effect even for creatures that know the password or are attuned-the password only prevents them from triggering the symbol, not from ignoring its effects if triggered.
  A _disintegrate_ spell or similar effect can destroy the _wall of force_ created by the symbol if the caster makes a caster level check against a DC of 11 + your caster level. A _knock_ spell has no effect on a _symbol of sealing_ or its force wall. A _symbol of sealing_ cannot be dispelled, but mage's disjunction automatically destroys it."

 #### Description
This spell allows you to scribe a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ rune of power upon or above a door or other opening measuring no more than 20 square feet/level in size. When the casting is completed, the symbol immediately triggers, glowing visibly and sealing the door or opening with an _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ barrier of force equivalent to a _[[spells/Wall Of Force|wall of force]]_. Destroying the symbol ends the effect, though destroying it once the symbol has been activated requires destroying the _wall of force_ first. Once triggered, the wall remains for 10 minutes per caster level.
  When scribing a _[[spells/Symbol of Sealing|symbol of sealing]]_, you can specify a password or phrase that allows a creature speaking it to bypass the seal and pass through the opening. You can also attune any number of creatures to the _symbol of sealing_, but doing this extends the casting time as described under _[[spells/Symbol of Death|symbol of death]]_ (Core Rulebook 355). However, the force wall created by the symbol blocks attacks and line of effect even for creatures that know the password or are attuned-the password only prevents them from triggering the symbol, not from ignoring its effects if triggered.
  A _[[spells/Disintegrate|disintegrate]]_ spell or similar effect can destroy the _wall of force_ created by the symbol if the caster makes a caster level check against a DC of 11 + your caster level. A _[[spells/Knock|knock]]_ spell has no effect on a _symbol of sealing_ or its force wall. A _symbol of sealing_ cannot be dispelled, but _[[spells/Mage's Disjunction|mage's disjunction]]_ automatically destroys it.
