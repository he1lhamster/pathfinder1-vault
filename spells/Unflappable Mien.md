It can choose to abandon the attempt, losing its action, or to push through the ward. If it pushes through, you can trigger a wave of force against that creature. This discharges the spell, deals 1d4 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 10d4), and pushes the creature back 5 feet. If the creature cannot be pushed back 5 feet (if a solid surface is directly behind it, for example), it takes 2d4 additional points of force damage. A successful Fortitude saving throw halves the total amount of force damage the creature takes.Members of the _[[npcs/Prophet of Kalistrade|Prophet of Kalistrade]]_ prestige class can cast this spell, even though it is not a _[[spells/Divination|divination]]_ or enchantment.
