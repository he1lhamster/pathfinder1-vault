  "You must sacrifice a creature just as you finish casting this spell. When the sacrifice dies, its blood or ichor pools and hardens into a single red bloodstone.

The bloodstone can only store racial spell-like abilities that emulate a spell, including altered spells, like _invisibility_ (self only), but not unique spell-like abilities possessed by the creature.

Additionally, the bloodstone can't store spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive components costing more than 250 gp. The save DC, caster level, and other attributes of this ability remain the same as when the creature was still alive, though the creature who activates the bloodstone can choose the targets, area, or shape of the spell, and make other decisions, such as controlling the target of _dominate person_. The bloodstone can take any actions necessary to manipulate aspects of the spell, concentrating on the spell, redirecting the spell, and so on, up to a full normal round's worth of actions. If the sacrificed creature doesn't die during the casting of the spell (for instance if it was merely a summoned creature) or is brought back to life before the spell's duration expires, the bloodstone loses its magical power. The fragment of the creature's spirit trapped in the bloodstone does not hinder attempts to restore the creature to life."

 #### Description
You must _[[spells/Sacrifice|sacrifice]]_ a creature just as you finish casting this spell. When the _sacrifice_ dies, its blood or ichor pools and hardens into a single red bloodstone. This bloodstone contains the essence and spirit of the sacrificed creature, allowing anyone holding the stone to activate the creature's highest-level activated racial spell-like ability, taking the actions necessary to activate the stored spell-like ability. Any creature who holds the stone can activate it, but the stone can be used only once per day (or the frequency of the creature's spell-like ability, whichever is less). If a creature has several racial _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ of the same spell level, choose randomly from among them to determine which one is stored in the bloodstone. The bloodstone can only store racial _spell-like abilities_ that emulate a spell, including altered spells, like _[[spells/Invisibility|invisibility]]_ (self only), but not unique _spell-like abilities_ possessed by the creature. Abilities with altered effects are still altered, so a creature activating the bloodstone for greater teleport (self only) would affect only itself and a bloodstone storing _[[spells/Summon Monster II|summon monster II]]_ (Small fire elemental only) would still only be able to _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ a Small fire elemental. Additionally, the bloodstone can't store _spell-like abilities_ that duplicate spells with expensive components costing more than 250 gp. The save DC, caster level, and other attributes of this ability remain the same as when the creature was still alive, though the creature who activates the bloodstone can choose the targets, area, or shape of the spell, and make other decisions, such as controlling the target of _[[spells/Dominate Person|dominate person]]_. The bloodstone can take any actions necessary to manipulate aspects of the spell, concentrating on the spell, redirecting the spell, and so on, up to a full normal round's worth of actions. If the sacrificed creature doesn't die during the casting of the spell (for instance if it was merely a summoned creature) or is brought back to life before the spell's duration expires, the bloodstone loses its magical power. The fragment of the creature's spirit trapped in the bloodstone does not _[[feats/Hinder|hinder]]_ attempts to restore the creature to life.
