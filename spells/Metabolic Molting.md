  "You encase the willing subject in a jeweled shell that has the same hardness and hit points as 5 inches of iron (hardness 10, hp 150).

 #### Description
You encase the willing subject in a jeweled shell that has the same hardness and hit points as 5 inches of iron (hardness 10, hp 150). For 7 days, the subject enters a state of suspended animation (as per _[[spells/Temporal Stasis|temporal stasis]]_), during which it heals from even the most grievous wounds. Each day, the subject regains 5 hit points per Hit Die it has as well as recovering from 2 points of ability damage or ability drain from any ability score of its choice. After 7 days, the shell crumbles away and the subject emerges, its body's severed limbs, _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ bones, and ruined organs regrown (as per _[[spells/Regenerate|regenerate]]_). If the gemstone you use for the component is worth at least 5,000 gp, _[[spells/Metabolic Molting|metabolic molting]]_ can bring a target back to life, as long as it has been dead for no more than 1 hour when the spell is cast. When the spell is used on such a creature, the creature comes back to life after 7 days and stabilizes at 0 hit points. A creature brought back to life through _metabolic molting_ gains 1 permanent negative level, or 2 points of Constitution drain if it is 1st level. Like _[[spells/Raise Dead|raise dead]]_, this spell can't save creatures slain by death effects.
