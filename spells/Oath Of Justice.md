  "This spell seals a solemn vow between two creatures. When this spell is cast, the targets must clasp hands and swear their oath in Kols's name.

This spell seals a solemn vow between two creatures. When this spell is cast, the targets must clasp hands and swear their oath in Kols's name. The spell functions like _[[spells/Mark of Justice|mark of justice]]_, except as noted above and rather than being cursed, the oath-breaker gains a mark on the face indicating to all dwarves who see it that the target has _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sacred|sacred]]_ oath, which gives the oath-breaker a -4 penalty to influence dwarves. The mark can be removed as described in the mark of justicespell, or the other target can forgive the oath- breaker, which causes the mark to _[[spells/Vanish|vanish]]_.
