  "You suppress magical sound-dampening effects within the area. _Disrupt _silence_ temporarily negates magical _silence_ within its area, so that normal sounds can be heard within the overlapping areas of effect. Additionally, _disrupt _silence_ can automatically counter or dispel any magical _silence_ effect of equal or lower level cast upon the same target, such as _silence_. If you cast _disrupt _silence_ on the target of a higher-level _silence_ effect, it functions as _dispel magic_ instead of its normal function."
