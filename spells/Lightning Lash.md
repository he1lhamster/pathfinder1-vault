  "You create a crackling lash of unholy lightning that flickers and flashes in your hand like a whip, shifting color in response to your mood and will. Once per round, you can make a melee touch attack with the _lightning lash_ against a target within 15 feet. If the attack is successful, it deals 1d6 points of electricity damage and 1d6 points of damage from divine power (similar to _flame_ strike), and allows you to attempt a trip combat maneuver check as a free action against your target (using your caster level as your CMB)."
