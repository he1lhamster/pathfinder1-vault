  "This spell grants the target magic item temporary intelligence by siphoning off a tiny portion of your own mind to infuse the object.

  When you cast _impart mind_ on a magic item, the item gains an Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma score of 10 and gains your alignment.

If the item gains the ability to cast a spell, determine the spell it can cast randomly from spells you know of the appropriate level.

Roll once on Tables 15-25 and 15-26 on page 534 of the _Core Rulebook_ to determine what the item's special purpose and dedicated powers are. These d% rolls are not modified by your caster level or any additional powdered gems you used to cast the spell.
  Once this spell ends, the item reverts to its previous nature-if you cast this spell on the item again, it gains entirely different powers as determined by a new set of rolls."
