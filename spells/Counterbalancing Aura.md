Third, the spell protects warded creatures from possession and influence by such creatures (otherwise as _protection from_ evil). Finally, if a chaotic neutral, lawful neutral, neutral evil, or neutral good creature successfully hits a warded creature with a melee attack, the attacker is sickened for 1d6 rounds (Fortitude negates).
