 #### Description
You create a suit of armor made of ice. While cold to the touch, it does not _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ the wearer, especially if worn over normal clothing (though it can hasten the effects of exposure in cold environments). It offers the same protection as a _[[items/Armor/Breastplate|breastplate]]_, except it has hardness 0 and 30 hit points. If the intended wearer is immersed in water when you cast this spell, you may form the armor around the wearer (who may be you); otherwise the wearer must don the armor normally. Attacks against the wearer that create _[[universal monster rules/Heat|heat]]_ or fire degrade the armor, reducing its armor bonus by 1 for every 5 points of fire damage the wearer takes; when the armor's bonus to AC reaches 0, the armor is destroyed and the spell ends. Because the ice is slightly buoyant, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Swim checks, except when swimming downward. Druids can wear _[[spells/Ice Armor|ice armor]]_ without penalty.
