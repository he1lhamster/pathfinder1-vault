  "This spell functions like _fog cloud_, but in addition to obscuring sight, the _solid fog_ is so thick that it impedes movement.
  Creatures moving through a _solid fog_ move at half their normal speed and take a -2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls.

A creature or object that falls into _solid fog_ is slowed so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces the falling damage by 1d6. A creature cannot take a 5-foot-step while in _solid fog_. _Solid fog_, and effects that work like _solid fog_, do not stack with each other in terms of slowed movement and attack penalties.
  Unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.
  _Solid fog_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell. A permanent _solid fog_ dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes."

 #### Description
This spell functions like _[[spells/Fog Cloud|fog cloud]]_, but in addition to obscuring sight, the _[[spells/Solid Fog|solid fog]]_ is so thick that it impedes movement.
  Creatures moving through a _solid fog_ move at half their normal speed and take a -2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into _solid fog_ is slowed so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces the falling damage by 1d6. A creature cannot take a 5-foot-step while in _solid fog_. _Solid fog_, and effects that work like _solid fog_, do not stack with each other in terms of slowed movement and attack penalties.
  Unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.
  _Solid fog_ can be made permanent with a _[[spells/Permanency|permanency]]_ spell. A permanent _solid fog_ dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.
