  "You preserve the remains of a dead creature so that they do not decay. Doing so effectively extends the time limit on raising that creature from the dead (see _raise dead_). Days spent under the influence of this spell don't count against the time limit.
  Additionally, this spell makes transporting a slain (and thus decaying) comrade less unpleasant.
  The spell also works on severed body parts and the like."
