Any creature that passes through the wall must save or become permanently blinded or deafened (as blindness/deafness). The wall must be vertical and either rectangular or a ring. It need not touch the ground. The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or creature when it is cast, the spell fails."
