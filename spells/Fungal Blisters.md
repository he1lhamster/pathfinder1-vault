  "When you cast this spell, horrible, fungal growths sprout forth all over your body. You develop 1d2+1 of these blisters per 2 caster levels. Each time you are dealt more than 5 points of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from a single attack, one of these blisters bursts, releasing a cloud of harmful spores in a 5-foot-radius burst centered on you. These spores enter the lungs of all living creatures within the cloud that need to breathe and deal 1d6+1 points of damage for every 2 caster levels you have (Fortitude negates). This is a disease effect, and you and plants aren't affected by the spores. It is possible for more than one blister to burst in a single round. If you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, all remaining blisters burst, and the resulting spores deal the cumulative amount of damage. You are not able to cast this spell while wearing heavy armor. If you don heavy armor during the spell's duration, all remaining blisters burst as if you had been reduced to 0 or fewer hit points."
