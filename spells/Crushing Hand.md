  "This spell functions as _interposing hand_, except that it can also grapple one opponent as _grasping hand_. Its CMB and CMD for grapple checks use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +12 bonus for its Strength score (35) and a +1 bonus for being Large (its Dexterity is 10, granting no bonus to the CMD). A _crushing hand_ deals 2d6+12 points of damage on each successful grapple check against an opponent. The _crushing hand_ can instead be directed to bull rush a target (as _forceful hand_), using the same bonuses outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as _interposing hand_ does."
