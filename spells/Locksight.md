  "The target can observe for 1 full round a lock that he is aware of (or object that includes a lock, such as a chest or door) that is within 60 feet to automatically determine whether it is open, closed, or jammed. If the target creature is trained in Disable Device, by concentrating on a lock for 3 rounds, he can also determine the quality of the lock (simple, average, good, or superior). This spell does not enable the target to see hidden locks, such as those on secret doors."
