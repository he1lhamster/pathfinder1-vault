  "_Trap the soul_ forces a creature's life force (and its material body) into a gem. The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, which allows the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane, it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.
  Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one of two ways.
  _Spell Completion_: First, the spell can be completed by speaking its final word as a standard action as if you were casting a regular spell at the subject. This allows spell resistance (if any) and a Will save to avoid the effect. If the creature's name is spoken as well, any spell resistance is ignored and the save DC increases by 2. If the save or spell resistance is successful, the gem shatters.
  _Trigger Object_: The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the trap.
  To use this method, both the creature's name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enspelled.
  A _sympathy_ spell can also be placed on the trigger object. As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of spell resistance or a save."

 #### Description
_[[spells/Trap the Soul|Trap the soul]]_ forces a creature's life force (and its material body) into a gem. The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or until the gem is _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ and the life force is released, which allows the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane, it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is _broken_.
  Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one of two ways.
  Spell Completion: First, the spell can be completed by speaking its _[[items/Weapon/Final Word|final word]]_ as a standard action as if you were casting a regular spell at the subject. This allows _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ (if any) and a Will save to avoid the effect. If the creature's name is spoken as well, any _spell resistance_ is ignored and the save DC increases by 2. If the save or _spell resistance_ is successful, the gem shatters.
  Trigger Object: The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the trap.
  To use this method, both the creature's name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enspelled.
  A _[[spells/Sympathy|sympathy]]_ spell can also be placed on the trigger object. As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of _spell resistance_ or a save.
