  "You instill the target with an intense, instinctual fear of a condition or circumstance, more powerful than the _phobia_ lesser madness (see page 182). You can name an energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), a hazard (such as an avalanche or earthquake), or a single creature of the animal type or all vermin (applying when the target sees a swarm or a single Small or larger creature). Alternatively, you can name the following specific environments: darkness (darker than dim light, and you can't apply this _phobia_ to a creature with natural racial darkvision, see in darkness, blindsight, or similar senses), enclosed spaces (places that require the creature to squeeze),heights (10 times the target's height, and you can't apply this _phobia_ to creatures with a natural fly speed), or water (you can't apply this _phobia_ to aquatic creatures or creatures with a natural swim speed). When the target takes damage of the energy type (for an energy type _phobia_), or perceives the presence of the creature, environment, or hazard, it must attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it fails, it becomes panicked, but even if it succeeds, it becomes shaken and feels intensely uncomfortable; a creature shaken in this way does not need to roll further saving throws against its _phobia_ until its shaken condition ends, even if it continues to be exposed to its _phobia_. A creature panicked by _phobia_ can begin to act normally 1 minute after it ceases being able to perceive its _phobia_ or after taking the energy damage if the _phobia_ is an energy type, though the shaken condition ends immediately after the creature can no longer perceive its _phobia_. _Break enchantment_, _heal_, _limited _wish_, _miracle_, or _wish_ can remove a _phobia_ spell."

 #### Description
You instill the target with an intense, instinctual _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ of a condition or circumstance, more powerful than the _[[spells/Phobia|phobia]]_ lesser madness (see page 182). You can name an energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), a hazard (such as an avalanche or _[[spells/Earthquake|earthquake]]_), or a single creature of the animal type or all vermin (applying when the target sees a swarm or a single Small or larger creature). Alternatively, you can name the following specific environments: _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_ (darker than dim light, and you can't apply this _phobia_ to a creature with natural racial _[[spells/Darkvision|darkvision]]_, _[[universal monster rules/See in Darkness|see in darkness]]_, _[[universal monster rules/Blindsight|blindsight]]_, or similar senses), enclosed spaces (places that require the creature to _[[spells/Squeeze|squeeze]]_),heights (10 times the target's height, and you can't apply this _phobia_ to creatures with a natural fly speed), or water (you can't apply this _phobia_ to aquatic creatures or creatures with a natural swim speed). When the target takes damage of the energy type (for an energy type _phobia_), or perceives the presence of the creature, environment, or hazard, it must attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it fails, it becomes _[[conditions/Panicked|panicked]]_, but even if it succeeds, it becomes _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ and feels intensely uncomfortable; a creature _shaken_ in this way does not need to roll further saving throws against its _phobia_ until its _shaken_ condition ends, even if it continues to be exposed to its _phobia_. A creature _panicked_ by _phobia_ can begin to act normally 1 minute after it ceases being able to perceive its _phobia_ or after taking the energy damage if the _phobia_ is an energy type, though the _shaken_ condition ends immediately after the creature can no longer perceive its _phobia_. _[[spells/Break Enchantment|Break enchantment]]_, _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_, _[[spells/Limited Wish|limited wish]]_, _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_, or _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ can remove a _phobia_ spell.
