  "_Interposing hand_ creates a Large magic hand that appears between you and one opponent. This floating, disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two of you, regardless of where you move or how the opponent tries to get around it, providing cover (+4 AC) for you against that opponent. Nothing can fool the hand-it sticks with the selected opponent in spite of _darkness,_ invisibility, polymorphing, or any other attempt at hiding or disguise. The hand does not pursue an opponent, however.
  An _interposing hand_ is 10 feet long and about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has as many hit points as you do when you're undamaged, and is AC 20 (-1 size, +11 natural). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that don't cause damage do not affect it.
  The hand never provokes attacks of opportunity from opponents.
  It cannot push through a _wall of force or_ enter an _antimagic field_, but it suffers the full effect of a _prismatic wall_ or _prismatic sphere._ The hand makes saving throws as its caster.
  _Disintegrate_ or a successful _dispel magic_ destroys it.
  Any creature weighing 2,000 pounds or less that tries to push past the hand is slowed to half its normal speed. The hand cannot reduce the speed of a creature weighing more than 2,000 pounds, but it still affects the creature's attacks.
  Directing the spell to a new target is a move action."

 #### Description
_[[spells/Interposing Hand|Interposing hand]]_ creates a Large magic hand that appears between you and one opponent. This floating, disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two of you, regardless of where you move or how the opponent tries to get around it, providing cover (+4 AC) for you against that opponent. Nothing can fool the hand-it sticks with the selected opponent in _[[spells/Spite|spite]]_ of _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_, _[[spells/Invisibility|invisibility]]_, polymorphing, or any other attempt at hiding or disguise. The hand does not pursue an opponent, however.
  An _interposing hand_ is 10 feet long and about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has as many hit points as you do when you're undamaged, and is AC 20 (-1 size, +11 natural). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that don't cause damage do not affect it.
  The hand never provokes attacks of opportunity from opponents.
  It cannot push through a _[[spells/Wall Of Force|wall of force]]_ or enter an _[[spells/Antimagic Field|antimagic field]]_, but it suffers the full effect of a _[[spells/Prismatic Wall|prismatic wall]]_ or _[[spells/Prismatic Sphere|prismatic sphere]]_. The hand makes saving throws as its caster.
  _[[spells/Disintegrate|Disintegrate]]_ or a successful _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ destroys it.
  Any creature weighing 2,000 pounds or less that tries to push past the hand is slowed to half its normal speed. The hand cannot reduce the speed of a creature weighing more than 2,000 pounds, but it still affects the creature's attacks.
  Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.
