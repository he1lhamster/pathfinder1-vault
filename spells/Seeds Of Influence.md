  "You leave a magical trace in the mind of a creature with an attitude of at least indifferent toward you. The target takes a cumulative -2 penalty on its Will save to negate the spell for each step by which its attitude is better than indifferent. The target takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against divination spells you cast. You can target that creature with mind-affecting spells of a spell level lower than _seeds of influence_ as if those spells were modified by Enlarge Spell (the modified spell doesn't take longer to cast and doesn't use a higher-level spell slot). Whenever the target succeeds at a saving throw against a divination or mind-affecting spell you cast, _seeds of influence_ ends for that target. A creature can be subject to only one _seeds of influence_ spell at a time; later castings of _seeds of influence_ remove any previous casting."

 #### Description
You leave a magical trace in the mind of a creature with an attitude of at least indifferent toward you. The target takes a cumulative -2 penalty on its Will save to negate the spell for each step by which its attitude is better than indifferent. The target takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against _[[spells/Divination|divination]]_ spells you cast. You can target that creature with mind-affecting spells of a spell level lower than _[[spells/Seeds Of Influence|seeds of influence]]_ as if those spells were modified by _[[feats/Enlarge Spell|Enlarge Spell]]_ (the modified spell doesn't take longer to cast and doesn't use a higher-level spell slot). Whenever the target succeeds at a saving throw against a _divination_ or mind-affecting spell you cast, _seeds of influence_ ends for that target. A creature can be subject to only one _seeds of influence_ spell at a time; later castings of _seeds of influence_ remove any previous casting.
