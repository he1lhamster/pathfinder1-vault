  "Glands along your neck, back, or wrists swell and exude a viscous injury poison (_save_ Fort DC 14; _frequency_ 1/round for 4 rounds; _effect_ 1d2 Str; _cure_ 1 _save_). You are not immune to this poison, and unless you have the poison use class feature or a similar ability, you are at risk of poisoning yourself. You can apply this poison to a weapon as a move action, and each dose you apply reduces the remaining duration of this spell by 1 minute. If doing so would reduce the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends, and any applied poisons retain their potency only until the end of your turn. When you apply the poison, you can choose to reduce the spell's remaining duration by 2 or more additional minutes (maximum = your caster level) in order to enhance that dose of poison. For every 2 minutes of duration expended, the poison's _save_ DC increases by 1, the number of rounds it lasts increases by 1/2 (round down), and the number of _save_s required to _cure_ it increases by 1/4 (round down). If you have the toxic skin alternate racial trait (_Advanced Race Guide_ 190), you can expend one daily use as a free action to enhance this spell's poison's damage to 1d3 Strength and its starting _save_ DC to 15."

You are not immune to this poison, and unless you have the poison use class feature or a similar ability, you are at risk of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Poisoning|poisoning]]_ yourself. You can apply this poison to a weapon as a move action, and each dose you apply reduces the remaining duration of this spell by 1 minute. If doing so would reduce the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends, and any applied poisons retain their potency only until the end of your turn. When you apply the poison, you can choose to reduce the spell's remaining duration by 2 or more additional minutes (maximum = your caster level) in order to enhance that dose of poison. For every 2 minutes of duration expended, the poison's save DC increases by 1, the number of rounds it lasts increases by 1/2 (round down), and the number of saves required to cure it increases by 1/4 (round down). If you have the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Toxic|toxic]]_ skin alternate racial trait (Advanced Race Guide 190), you can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ one daily use as a free action to enhance this spell's poison's damage to 1d3 Strength and its starting save DC to 15.
