  "This spell functions like _minor image_, except it always creates an animated illusion of you presenting to a vampire a material, object, or sound that it is averse to, such as garlic, a holy symbol, or bells ringing. You specify what aversion the illusion depicts when you cast the spell. The vampire reacts to the illusion as if it were real; it can overcome the effect by succeeding at a disbelief save or a normal Will save against the illusion's DC (instead of the normal DC 25 to overcome its revulsion). The illusion is only quasi-real and cannot otherwise affect creatures."
