  "This spell functions like _nondetection_, except it blocks the effects of only divination spells and effects that target an area, rather than you or an object in your possession specifically. For example, lesser _nondetection_ doesn't ward you against a spellcaster who is attempting to scry on you with the _scrying_ spell or find an object in your possession with _locate object_, but it does protect you against effects that target an area you happen to be in, such as detect spells or _clairaudience/clairvoyance_."
