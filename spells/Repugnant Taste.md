  "The target creature begins sweating a foul liquid that makes it repugnant to most living creatures. When a creature deals damage to the affected creature with a bite attack or the swallow whole ability, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or become nauseated until the end of its next turn. After a creature has become nauseated by this spell, each subsequent failed saving throw against the spell instead gives it the sickened condition until the end of its next turn."
