 #### Description
You can observe a creature at any distance. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, the spell fails. The difficulty of the save depends on how well your knowledge of the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature.
  Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, it gets a +5 bonus on its Will save.

  If the save fails, you can see and hear the subject and its surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject).

In addition, the following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating through the sensor: _[[spells/Detect Chaos|detect chaos]]_, _[[spells/Detect Evil|detect evil]]_, _[[spells/Detect Good|detect good]]_, _[[spells/Detect Law|detect law]]_, _[[spells/Detect Magic|detect magic]]_, and _[[spells/Message|message]]_.
