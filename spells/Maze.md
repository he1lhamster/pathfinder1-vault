 #### Description
You banish the subject into an extradimensional labyrinth. Each round on its turn, it may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the labyrinth as a full-round action. If the subject doesn't escape, the _[[spells/Maze|maze]]_ disappears after 10 minutes, freeing the subject.
  On escaping or leaving the _maze_, the subject reappears where it had been when the _maze_ spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space.
  Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as teleport and _[[spells/Dimension Door|dimension door]]_, do not help a creature escape a _maze_ spell, although a _[[spells/Plane Shift|plane shift]]_ spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell. Minotaurs are not affected by this spell.
