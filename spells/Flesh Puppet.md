 #### Description
You animate one corpse that has been dead no more than 48 hours. It rises as a zombie (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 288) that is magically tethered to you and obeys your commands. As noted in _[[spells/Animate Dead|animate dead]]_, you can't control more than 4 HD per caster level worth of undead in total, nor can a single casting create more than 2 HD per caster level. This spell disguises the zombie's appearance and allows you to control it. The zombie's outward appearance, movement, and voice appear the same as if it were still alive. The zombie's normal _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ condition doesn't apply (though it can still be _staggered_ by other means). Successfully detecting the _[[spells/Flesh Puppet|flesh puppet]]_ as a zombie without magic requires an opposed Perception check against your Disguise check, and you add your caster level as a bonus on this Disguise check. An ephemeral string connects you to the zombie. Through this string, you have a mental link to the zombie and can _[[spells/Command|command]]_ it as a swift action. The zombie uses its own actions to complete your commands. The zombie can speak up to 25 words in 1 round, but you must mentally impart what you intend it to say as a swift action. It is incapable of articulating speech on its own. The zombie can be ordered to perform very simple tasks it knew in life but can't make attacks, cast spells, or perform complex or difficult tasks requiring constant concentration. The string connecting you and the zombie is nearly _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_. A DC 30 Perception check is required to detect it. It has hardness 0 and 1 hp. The length of string you can create is 100 feet + 10 feet per caster level you have. The string snaps if you and the zombie move farther apart than this length, though the zombie won't move out of range unless forced to do so or unless you _command_ it to do so. If the string to the zombie is severed, the spell immediately ends. The ephemeral string can pass through physical barriers, but not barriers of magical force, and it can be damaged as though it were a physical object. When this spell ends, the zombie immediately reverts back to a normal corpse. The spell ends automatically if you cast _flesh puppet_ or _[[spells/Flesh Puppet Horde|flesh puppet horde]]_ on a new corpse.
