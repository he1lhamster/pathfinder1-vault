Acrobatics checks in the area take a penalty equal to your caster level (maximum +10).

If they attempt to move while _entangled_, they must make a second Reflex save or fall _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_. Creatures with the stability racial trait (like dwarves) may apply it as a bonus on their saving throws.

Creatures that are _entangled_ or _prone_ in the spell's area are carried along with the _shifting sand_ in the same direction if possible. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
