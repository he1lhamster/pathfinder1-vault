  "This spell functions as _darkness_, except that objects radiate _darkness_ in a 60-foot radius and the light level is lowered by two steps.

This functions like _darkness_, but even creatures with darkvision cannot see within the spell's confines.
  This spell does not stack with itself. **Deeper** _darkness_ can be used to counter or dispel any light spell of equal or lower spell level."
