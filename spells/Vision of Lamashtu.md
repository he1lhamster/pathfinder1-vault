The target is allowed to save against the second spell if a save is allowed. For example, a cleric of Lamashtu could send _bestow curse_ along as part of a _vision of Lamashtu_, but not _blade barrier_ (affects an area), _destruction_ (too high level), or _inflict moderate wounds_ (deals hit point damage)."

 #### Description
This spell functions exactly as the spell _[[spells/Nightmare|nightmare]]_. In addition to the effects of that spell, you can cause a second spell to be delivered when the target wakes at the _nightmare_'s conclusion.
  You must have this second spell prepared, and it must be cast immediately after _[[spells/Vision of Lamashtu|vision of Lamashtu]]_ (effectively adding the two spells' casting times). This second spell "rides along" with the _nightmare_, affecting the target as soon as it wakes from its fitful sleep. Any spell can be sent along with the _nightmare_, so long as it is of 6th level or lower, affects one target (which is always the _nightmare_'s recipient), and does not deal hit point damage. The second spell's range is irrelevant for the purposes of _vision of Lamashtu_, and even touch attacks can be delivered in this manner (you must still make a successful touch attack in order to affect the target, though, with the act of touching occurring within the context of the victim's _nightmare_). The target is allowed to save against the second spell if a save is allowed. For example, a _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ of Lamashtu could send _[[spells/Bestow Curse|bestow curse]]_ along as part of a _vision of Lamashtu_, but not _[[spells/Blade Barrier|blade barrier]]_ (affects an area), _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ (too high level), or _[[spells/Inflict Moderate Wounds|inflict moderate wounds]]_ (deals hit point damage).
