  "You rapidly catalog and collate all available data on a person, place, thing, or event, calling to mind scraps of memory and assembling clues in a logical and systematic order. Immediately after casting the spell, you can begin spending the necessary time to perform an Intelligence check, a Linguistics check to detect a forgery or decipher a hidden message, or a Knowledge check. If the check requires at least 3 rounds, you can perform it five times as quickly (minimum 1 round). If the check required fewer than 3 rounds, you can perform it instantly. Either way, you gain an insight bonus on the check equal to your caster level (maximum bonus +10), but this bonus can't raise your result above what you could have achieved on a natural 20."

 #### Description
You rapidly catalog and collate all available data on a person, place, thing, or event, calling to mind scraps of memory and assembling clues in a logical and systematic order. Immediately after casting the spell, you can begin spending the necessary time to perform an Intelligence check, a Linguistics check to detect a forgery or decipher a hidden _[[spells/Message|message]]_, or a Knowledge check. If the check requires at least 3 rounds, you can perform it five times as quickly (minimum 1 round). If the check required fewer than 3 rounds, you can perform it instantly. Either way, you gain an insight bonus on the check equal to your caster level (maximum bonus +10), but this bonus can't raise your result above what you could have achieved on a natural 20.
