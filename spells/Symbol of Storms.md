  "This spell functions as symbol of death, except that when triggered, a 30-foot-radius centered on the symbol fills with hurricane-force winds (75 mph). Each round, a bolt of lightning that deals 10d6 points of electricity damage strikes a random creature within the area. A successful Reflex save halves this damage. Unlike symbol of death, symbol of storms has no hit point limit.

Once triggered, a symbol of storms remains active for 1 minute per caster level."
