  "You inflict a curse similar to the spell burn spellblight (_Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic_ 97) on a creature. Each time a spellcaster who is afflicted with this curse casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, her skin seems to burn as though she were on fire. With a successful concentration check (DC = 15 + double the spell level of the spell cast or spell-like ability used), the spellcaster can ignore the pain of the effect, but if she fails, she loses the spell or spell slot and is staggered for a round. Unlike with the spell burn spellblight, the burning sensation is a tangible effect, visible during the act of spellcasting as an incorporeal, violet flame surrounding the caster."

 #### Description
You inflict a curse similar to the spell _[[universal monster rules/Burn|burn]]_ spellblight (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 97) on a creature. Each time a spellcaster who is afflicted with this curse casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, her skin seems to _burn_ as though she were on fire. With a successful concentration check (DC = 15 + double the spell level of the spell cast or spell-like ability used), the spellcaster can ignore the pain of the effect, but if she fails, she loses the spell or spell slot and is _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for a round. Unlike with the spell _burn_ spellblight, the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Burning|burning]]_ sensation is a tangible effect, visible during the act of spellcasting as an _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_, violet flame surrounding the caster.
