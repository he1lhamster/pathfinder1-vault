  "You curse your target with a withering aura that degrades its armor and shield (if any). This reduces the hardness, armor bonus, and enhancement bonus of any armor or shield worn by the target by 1. For every hour the target wears a suit of armor or a shield, the hardness, armor bonus, and enhancement bonus are reduced by an additional 1. If the armor or shield's hardness is reduced to 0, anytime the target of the curse is struck while wearing that item, there is a 20% chance that it gains the broken condition. If the enhancement bonus of magic suit of armor or shield is reduced to 0, the armor or shield loses any other special abilities it had. If the target removes the suit of armor or shield (even if it's broken or has been drained of all enhancement bonuses), the armor or shield regains its hardness, armor bonus, and enhancement bonus at the rate of 1 per 2 hours. A suit of armor or shield broken by this curse that regains its full hardness ceases to be broken. A magic suit of armor or shield that lost its special abilities regains them when its enhancement bonus is fully restored."

 #### Description
You curse your target with a withering aura that degrades its armor and _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ (if any). This reduces the hardness, armor bonus, and enhancement bonus of any armor or _shield_ worn by the target by 1. For every hour the target wears a suit of armor or a _shield_, the hardness, armor bonus, and enhancement bonus are reduced by an additional 1. If the armor or _shield_'s hardness is reduced to 0, anytime the target of the curse is struck while wearing that item, there is a 20% chance that it gains the _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ condition. If the enhancement bonus of magic suit of armor or _shield_ is reduced to 0, the armor or _shield_ loses any other special abilities it had. If the target removes the suit of armor or _shield_ (even if it's _broken_ or has been drained of all enhancement bonuses), the armor or _shield_ regains its hardness, armor bonus, and enhancement bonus at the rate of 1 per 2 hours. A suit of armor or _shield_ _broken_ by this curse that regains its full hardness ceases to be _broken_. A magic suit of armor or _shield_ that lost its special abilities regains them when its enhancement bonus is fully restored.
