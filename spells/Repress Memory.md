This knowledge disappears utterly from your mind, and you might not realize you forgot something. The magic of the spell patches omissions in your memory with indistinct haze _[[spells/Repress Memory|Repress memory]]_ protects against _[[spells/Detect Thoughts|detect thoughts]]_, _[[spells/Discern Lies|discern lies]]_, _[[spells/Zone of Truth|zone of truth]]_, and similar spells, though careful questioning may reveal the gaps in your memory, or that your memory has been affected by the spell. A repressed memory can be restored only by _[[spells/Break Enchantment|break enchantment]]_, _[[spells/Psychic Surgery|psychic surgery]]_, _[[spells/Limited Wish|limited wish]]_, _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_, or _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_. If you use this spell to negate the memory of a magical compulsion, it doesn't remove the compulsion, nor does it remove procedural memories that might affect your skills or class abilities.
