  "This spell was developed by an Aldori Academy student after several weeks of observing (and occasionally joining) Restov barroom brawls. You draw on your mind's hidden reserves, instantaneously mastering advanced combat techniques. When you cast this spell, choose a combat feat. You must meet all prerequisites for this feat, treating your magus level as your base attack bonus for this purpose. For the duration of this spell, you are treated as if you had the chosen feat. Once you cast this spell, you cannot change the chosen feat (or any decisions related to that feat) for additional castings of this spell on the same day. A creature can benefit from only one _tactical adaptation_ spell at a time."
