Whether or not the target saves, it takes 1 point of cold damage per caster level each round it is _helpless_ or _entangled_ in the ice. The ice has hardness 0 and 3 hit points per inch of thickness; if _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_, the creature is freed. A creature can break the ice as a full-round action with a successful Strength check (DC 15 + your caster level).
