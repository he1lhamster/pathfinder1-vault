  While projecting your shadow, you gain a shadow's darkvision, defensive abilities, fly speed, racial stealth modifier, and strength damage attack. You do not gain the creature's _create spawn_ ability, nor its skill ranks or Hit Dice.

  Your _shadow projection_ has the undead type and may be turned or affected as undead.
