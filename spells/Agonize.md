  "You afflict a creature you have conjured via _planar ally_ (or a similar spell) with bolts of vicious energy. These foul energies inflict terrible pain upon the summoned creature, torturing it to make it more pliant to your will.

However, beings tortured by this spell quickly come to resent you, making them more likely to try to pervert your orders to malicious ends or try to seek retribution after their release. This spell has no effect on creatures that are immune to nonlethal damage."
