A target that isn't willing to have his tattoo removed or to receive the transferred tattoo can resist this spell with a Fortitude save-if successful, the transfer fails and the caster of this spell is staggered for 1 round by the backlash of magical energy. A tattoo can be transferred from a dead creature in this manner to a living host, provided the body has been dead no longer than one hour per caster level."
