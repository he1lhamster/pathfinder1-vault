  "This abjuration grants a creature limited _protection_ from damage of whichever one of five energy types you select: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The subject gains _resist energy_ 10 against the energy type chosen, meaning that each time the creature is subjected to such damage (whether from a natural or magical source), that damage is reduced by 10 points before being applied to the creature's hit points. The value of the energy resistance granted increases to 20 points at 7th level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level. The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well.
  _Resist energy_ absorbs only damage. The subject could still suffer unfortunate side effects.
  _Resist energy_ overlaps (and does not stack with) _protection_ from energy_. If a character is warded by _protection_ from energy_ and _resist energy_, the _protection_ spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted."

 #### Description
This abjuration grants a creature limited protection from damage of whichever one of five energy types you select: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The subject gains _[[spells/Resist Energy|resist energy]]_ 10 against the energy type chosen, meaning that each time the creature is subjected to such damage (whether from a natural or magical source), that damage is reduced by 10 points before being applied to the creature's hit points. The value of the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Energy Resistance|energy resistance]]_ granted increases to 20 points at 7th level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level. The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well.
  _Resist energy_ absorbs only damage. The subject could still suffer unfortunate side effects.
  _Resist energy_ overlaps (and does not stack with) _[[spells/Protection from Energy|protection from energy]]_. If a character is warded by _protection from energy_ and _resist energy_, the protection spell absorbs damage until its power is _[[conditions/Exhausted|exhausted]]_.
