  "With a touch, you enchant a shield and enable it to protect its wielder from hostile spells. The shield grants spell resistance 10 + your caster level against spells so long as the shield can be interposed between the wielder and the spell effect. A _spell shield_ does not provide spell resistance against area effect spells such as _fireball_, but does provide a +5 bonus on Reflex saving throws against such spells."
