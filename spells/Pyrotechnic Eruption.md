Each round, the damage dealt is reduced to half as many d6; the spell expires when it would deal no damage. If the target moves, the _[[spells/Pyrotechnic Eruption|pyrotechnic eruption]]_ follows, even if the target teleports. Anyone attempting to touch the target takes damage, using the same amount of dice as the last time the target attempted a save (Reflex half).
