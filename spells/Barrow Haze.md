  "_Barrow haze_ creates a bank of fog similar to that created by _fog cloud_, except that the vapors are black and they have a necromantic link to you. The vapors do not interfere with your vision. Because of your link to the haze, if any part of it is within 30 feet of you, any creatures within the haze count as in range for the purpose of using any of your hexes that have a maximum range of 30 feet.
  For example, suppose you have the slumber hex, you are 25 feet from one edge of the haze, and an opponent is 40 feet farther away at the other extreme of the cloud. You can use your slumber hex on that opponent even though it is actually 65 feet away from you."

 #### Description
_[[spells/Barrow Haze|Barrow haze]]_ creates a bank of fog similar to that created by _[[spells/Fog Cloud|fog cloud]]_, except that the vapors are black and they have a necromantic link to you. The vapors do not interfere with your _[[spells/Vision|vision]]_. Because of your link to the haze, if any part of it is within 30 feet of you, any creatures within the haze count as in range for the purpose of using any of your hexes that have a maximum range of 30 feet.
  For example, suppose you have the slumber hex, you are 25 feet from one edge of the haze, and an opponent is 40 feet farther away at the other extreme of the cloud. You can use your slumber hex on that opponent even though it is actually 65 feet away from you.
