Aroden's _spellbane_ otherwise functions like _antimagic field_, except its emanation only prevents the functioning of the selected spells.

  Aroden's _spellbane_ can even negate an _antimagic field_, another Aroden's _spellbane_, or any spell that specifies immunity to _antimagic field_ (such as _wall of force_, _prismatic_ sphere_, and _prismatic_ wall). Multiple _spellbane_ effects can overlap.
  Their effects stack, preventing the functioning of every spell targeted by any of the multiple _spellbane_ emanations. Spell effects created by artifacts or deities cannot be suppressed by Aroden's _spellbane_."

 #### Description
One of many spells originally created by the Last Azlanti before he became a god, _[[spells/Aroden's Spellbane|Aroden's spellbane]]_ creates an area within which spells selected by you simply do not function.
  Select one spell per five caster levels at the time of casting.
  The spells selected cannot be changed after the spell is cast. _Aroden's spellbane_ otherwise functions like _[[spells/Antimagic Field|antimagic field]]_, except its emanation only prevents the functioning of the selected spells. Only the exact spells mentioned are affected-a spellbane set to prevent the casting of _[[spells/Summon Nature's Ally II|summon nature's ally II]]_ would not prevent castings of _[[spells/Summon Nature's Ally I|summon nature's ally I]]_ or _[[spells/Summon Nature's Ally III|summon nature's ally III]]_. If you move into an area where a previously cast spell you have selected as a banned spell is in effect, that spell is affected as if by _antimagic field_. If the spell affects a summoned creature that has _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_, you must make a caster level check against the creature's _spell resistance_ to make it wink out.
  _Aroden's spellbane_ can even negate an _antimagic field_, another _Aroden's spellbane_, or any spell that specifies _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to _antimagic field_ (such as _[[spells/Wall Of Force|wall of force]]_, _[[spells/Prismatic Sphere|prismatic sphere]]_, and _[[spells/Prismatic Wall|prismatic wall]]_). Multiple spellbane effects can overlap.
  Their effects stack, preventing the functioning of every spell targeted by any of the multiple spellbane emanations. Spell effects created by artifacts or deities cannot be suppressed by _Aroden's spellbane_.
