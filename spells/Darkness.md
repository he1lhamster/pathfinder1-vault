  "This spell causes an object to radiate _darkness_ out to a 20-foot radius. This _darkness_ causes the illumination level in the area to drop one step, from bright light to normal light, from normal light to dim light, or from dim light to _darkness_. This spell has no effect in an area that is already dark. Creatures with light vulnerability or sensitivity take no penalties in normal light. All creatures gain concealment (20% miss chance) in dim light. All creatures gain total concealment (50% miss chance) in _darkness_.
  Creatures with darkvision can see in an area of dim light or _darkness_ without penalty. Nonmagical sources of light, such as torches and lanterns, do not increase the light level in an area of _darkness_. Magical light sources only increase the light level in an area if they are of a higher spell level than _darkness_.
  If _darkness_ is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell's effect is blocked until the covering is removed.
  This spell does not stack with itself. _Darkness_ can be used to counter or dispel any light spell of equal or lower spell level."
