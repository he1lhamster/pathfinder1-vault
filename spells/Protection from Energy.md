  "_Protection from energy_ grants temporary immunity to the type of energy you specify when you cast it (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). When the spell absorbs 12 points per caster level of energy damage (to a maximum of 120 points at 10th level), it is discharged.
  _Protection from energy_ overlaps (and does not stack with) _resist energy_._ If a character is warded by _protection_ from energy_ and _resist energy_, the _protection_ spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted."
