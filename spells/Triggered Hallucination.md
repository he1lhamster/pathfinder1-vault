  "This spell functions as _audiovisual_ hallucination_ (see page 204), except that this spell's phantasm has no apparent effect until a specific condition occurs. You must overcome the target's spell resistance to plant the _triggered hallucination_, but the target doesn't attempt a Will save to disbelieve the illusion until the condition occurs (at which point it receives an automatic Will save, as with _audiovisual_ hallucination_). The phantasm can include auditory, olfactory, visual, tactile, and thermal elements, including intelligible speech. You set the triggering condition (such as hearing a certain word or seeing a type of creature) when casting the spell. The event that triggers the illusion can be as general or detailed as desired but must be based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual trigger. The trigger can't be based on any quality not normally obvious to the senses, such as alignment. _Triggered hallucination_ uses the target's senses to notice triggers."

 #### Description
This spell functions as _[[spells/Audiovisual Hallucination|audiovisual hallucination]]_ (see page 204), except that this spell's phantasm has no apparent effect until a specific condition occurs. You must overcome the target's _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ to plant the _[[spells/Triggered Hallucination|triggered hallucination]]_, but the target doesn't attempt a Will save to disbelieve the illusion until the condition occurs (at which point it receives an automatic Will save, as with _audiovisual hallucination_). The phantasm can include auditory, olfactory, visual, tactile, and thermal elements, including intelligible speech. You set the triggering condition (such as hearing a certain word or seeing a type of creature) when casting the spell. The event that triggers the illusion can be as general or detailed as desired but must be based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual trigger. The trigger can't be based on any quality not normally obvious to the senses, such as alignment. _Triggered hallucination_ uses the target's senses to notice triggers.
