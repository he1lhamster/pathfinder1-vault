  "Whenever you cast this spell, you can assume the form of any type of Large naga (including most nagas, but not royal nagas), though not the form of a specific individual. In effect, you transform into a Large serpent, gaining a +4 size bonus to your Strength, a -2 penalty to your Dexterity, and a +4 natural armor bonus. Unlike with _beast shape II_, however, you keep your own head when using this spell and can cast spells with verbal and somatic components, even though the naga form doesn't have hands.
