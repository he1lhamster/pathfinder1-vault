  "This spell functions as _heroism_, except that you can reverse the spell by issuing a special command as a standard action if you are within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) of the target. The target loses the bonuses and instead takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until the spell's duration ends (no save). Attempts to identify hollow _heroism_ with a skill check incorrectly identify it as _heroism_ (see the ruse descriptor on page 192)."
