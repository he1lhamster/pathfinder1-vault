 #### Description
You call into being around you an _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ barrier of force within which magic cannot persist. Within the area of the spell, effects are suppressed and creatures are affected as by _[[spells/Antimagic Field|antimagic field]]_. An immobile sphere of impenetrable force surrounds the field, equivalent in all ways to a spherical _[[spells/Wall Of Force|wall of force]]_, including its _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ and _[[curses/Vulnerability|vulnerability]]_ to a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Sphere of Annihilation|sphere of annihilation]]_ or _[[items/Rod/Rod of Cancellation|rod of cancellation]]_. The barrier has hardness 40 and 20 hit points per caster level, and can be damaged by both mundane attacks and spells cast from outside the field. If the bubble of force is destroyed, the spell's duration ends.
  Spells cannot be cast within, into, or out of the enclosure, and teleportation effects that ignore a _wall of force_ (such as _[[spells/Dimension Door|dimension door]]_ or teleport) are thwarted by the enclosure's field of antimagic.
  _[[spells/Echean's Excellent Enclosure|Echean's excellent enclosure]]_ has the same effect on summoned creatures of any type and _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ undead that an _antimagic field_ does, causing them to wink out of existence for the duration of _Echean's excellent enclosure_ unless their _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_, if any, allows them to remain where they are within the field.
