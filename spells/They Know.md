 #### Description
You instill a target with the _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ that the nearest other intelligent creature knows her darkest secret. If she is in the midst of another situation as vital as protecting her darkest secret, such as combat, this doesn't cause her to cease participating, but otherwise, she becomes compelled to use her abilities and skills to determine exactly how much the other individual knows. Even if she isn't around other creatures or otherwise avoids confronting her _[[spells/Paranoia|paranoia]]_ for a time, the nagging _fear_ causes the target to become _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for the duration of the spell (though this doesn't stack with other _fear_ effects to make the target _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_ or _[[conditions/Panicked|panicked]]_). The subject's _paranoia_ increases over time, forcing her to take additional steps to protect herself from the other creature. Depending on her personality (or subject to the GM's discretion), she might _[[spells/Confess|confess]]_, publicly _[[spells/Demand|demand]]_ to know what the other creature knows, attack the other creature to _[[spells/Silence|silence]]_ it, or offer the other creature a bribe. The spell fails if the target truly feels she has nothing to hide.
