  "A _protective spirit_ is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that hovers about you, defending you against unexpected attacks. When a creature makes an attack of opportunity against you, the _protective spirit_ makes an immediate attack using your base attack bonus plus your Dexterity modifier. On a successful hit, the spirit does no damage, but it causes the attack of opportunity to automatically miss. A _protective spirit_ can defend against a number of attacks of opportunity equal to your Dexterity bonus (minimum 1) per round.
  A _protective spirit_ occupies your space, and moves with you. It cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but _dispel magic_, _disintegrate_, _a sphere of annihilation_, or a _rod of cancellation_ affects it. A _protective spirit_'s AC against touch attacks is 10 + your Dexterity modifier."
