 #### Description
An ally made of pure force appears in a single 5-foot square within range. The ally takes the form of a servant of your god.
  The _[[spells/Spiritual Ally|spiritual ally]]_ occupies its space, though you and your allies can move through it, since it is your ally. The _spiritual ally_ carries a single weapon, one favored by your deity (as for _[[spells/Spiritual Weapon|spiritual weapon]]_), which has the same threat range and critical modifiers as a real weapon of its form. Each round on your turn, starting with the turn that you cast this spell, your _spiritual ally_ can make an attack against a foe within its reach that you designate. The _spiritual ally_ threatens adjacent squares and can flank and make attacks of opportunity as if it were a normal creature. The _spiritual ally_ uses your base attack bonus (gaining extra attacks if your base attack bonus is high enough) plus your Wisdom bonus when it makes a melee attack. When the _spiritual ally_ hits, it deals 1d10 points of force damage + 1 point of damage per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). It strikes as a spell, not a weapon, so it bypasses DR and can affect _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ creatures.
  Each round after the first, you can move the _spiritual ally_ as a swift action. It has a speed of 30 feet, and a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect maneuverability). Being a construct of force, the _spiritual ally_ cannot be harmed by any physical attacks, but _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_, _[[spells/Disintegrate|disintegrate]]_, a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Sphere of Annihilation|sphere of annihilation]]_, or a _[[items/Rod/Rod of Cancellation|rod of cancellation]]_ affects it. A _spiritual ally_'s AC against touch attacks is 10.
  If an attacked creature has _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that _spell resistance_ the first time the _spiritual ally_ strikes it. If the ally is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.
