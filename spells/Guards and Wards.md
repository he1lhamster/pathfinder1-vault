  "This powerful spell is primarily used to defend a stronghold or fortress by creating a number of magical wards and effects. The ward protects 200 square feet per caster level. The warded area can be as much as 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area.
  _Fog: Fog_ fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no.
  _Arcane Locks_: All doors in the warded area are _arcane locked._
  Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no.
  _Webs: Webs_ fill all stairs from top to bottom. These strands are identical with those created by the _web_ spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the _guards and wards_ spell lasts. Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text for _web_. Spell Resistance: no.
  _Confusion:_ Where there are choices in direction-such as a corridor intersection or side passage-a minor _confusion-type_ effect functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This is a mind-affecting effect. Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: yes.
  _Lost Doors_: One door per caster level is covered by a _silent image_ to appear as if it were a plain wall. Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with). Spell Resistance: no.
  In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects.
   1. _Dancing lights_ in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that causes the lights to repeat as long as the _guards and wards_ spell lasts. Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no.
   2. A _magic mouth_ in two places. Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no.
   3. A _stinking cloud_ in two places. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while the _guards and wards_ spell lasts. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates; see text for _stinking cloud_. Spell Resistance: no.
   4. A _gust of wind in_ one corridor or room. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates. Spell Resistance: yes.
   5. A _suggestion_ in one place. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature who enters or passes through the area receives the _suggestion_ mentally. Saving Throw: Will negates.
  Spell Resistance: yes.
  The whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration school. A _dispel magic_ cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. A successful mage's disjunction destroys the entire _guards and wards_ effect."

The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area.
  Fog: Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including _[[spells/Darkvision|darkvision]]_, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance).

Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text for web. _Spell Resistance_: no.
