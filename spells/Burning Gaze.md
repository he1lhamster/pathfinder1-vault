  "Your eyes burn like hot coals, allowing you to set objects or foes alight with a glance.
  As a standard action as long as this spell's effects persist, you may direct your _burning gaze_ against a single creature or object within 30 feet of your location. Targeted creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of fire damage. Unattended objects do not get a save. Creatures damaged by the spell must make a Reflex save or catch fire.
  Each round, burning creatures may attempt a Reflex save to quench the flames; failure results in another 1d6 points of fire damage. Flammable items worn by a creature must also save or take the same damage as the creature. If a creature or object is already on fire, it suffers no additional effects from _burning gaze_.
  Note that this spell does not grant an actual gaze attack- foes and allies are not in danger of catching on fire simply by meeting your gaze."
