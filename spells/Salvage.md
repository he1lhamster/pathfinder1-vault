  At the end of the duration, an _[[spells/Air Bubble|air bubble]]_ forms around the repaired ship. If submerged, the ship shoots to the surface, erupting with a great splash before settling on the water.
  Though the spell requires time to repair the ship, its effects are instantaneous. A salvaged ship cannot be dispelled to return it to a shipwreck. However, before the spell's duration ends and while the ship is still being repaired, _[[spells/Salvage|salvage]]_ can be dispelled to interrupt the repair process. The ship remains in the condition it was in when the spell was interrupted until a new _salvage_ spell is cast (but continues to age normally and suffers the effects of its environments). A new _salvage_ spell's duration is modified by any repairs already begun.
