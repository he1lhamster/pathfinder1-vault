  "You gift the target with the ability to perfect its actions via mental clarity. On the next attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or sk_ill_ check the target attempts, it rolls twice and takes the more favorable result. For every 5 caster levels you have, the target can roll twice on an additional attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or sk_ill_ check (to a maximum of 5 rolls at 20th level). _Hermean potential_ is countered and dispelled by _ill_ omenAPG, but does not itself counter or dispel _ill_ omen."
