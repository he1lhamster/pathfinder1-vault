Each time a creature starts its turn while impaled by the javelin, it takes another 1d6 points of damage.

The _holy javelin_ glows like a torch, and this light clearly indicates the impaled creature's location, even if it turns invisible. Since this light is not a light effect, just the glow of a conjured javelin, darkness spells always suppress it, even if they are lower level."

 #### Description
You create a shimmering _[[items/Weapon/Javelin|javelin]]_ of holy energy to hurl at an enemy as a ranged touched attack. The _javelin_ deals 1d6 points of damage to an evil creature on a successful attack; it dissipates harmlessly against creatures of any other alignment. Each time a creature starts its turn while impaled by the _javelin_, it takes another 1d6 points of damage. For every 4 caster levels you have, the _javelin_ remains in the creature for an additional round (to a maximum of 5 rounds at 18th level). While the creature remains impaled, it takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and skill checks. As a move action, the creature (or another adjacent creature) can attempt to _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ the _javelin_ out (causing it to immediately disappear) with a DC 12 Strength check. The _[[spells/Holy Javelin|holy javelin]]_ glows like a _[[items/Mundane/Torch|torch]]_, and this light clearly indicates the impaled creature's location, even if it turns _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_. Since this light is not a light effect, just the glow of a conjured _javelin_, _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_ spells always suppress it, even if they are lower level.
