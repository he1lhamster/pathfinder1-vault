  "A glamered bubble surrounds the target's space, rendering her completely invisible underwater by hiding both the target and any water she displaces. Because of the bubble's size limit, this spell works only on Medium or smaller targets. Other objects and creatures within the bubble's space are also invisible while they stay in the space, which could reveal the spell's existence to a canny observer who notices fish disappearing into the bubble and reappearing on the other side. Creatures inside the bubble can see each other, which allows foes who can pinpoint the bubble's location (such as dragons) to stick their heads into the bubble in order to see the target. Any creature on the inside of the bubble that takes any action that would break _invisibility_ pops the bubble and ends the spell early. On land, the bubble is clearly visible, acting much as _invisibility_ does in the water. Unlike with _invisibility_, the inside of the bubble blocks light from escaping the bubble, meaning that light sources inside the bubble don't illuminate past its edges, but also don't reveal a telltale glow."

 #### Description
A _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Glamered|glamered]]_ bubble surrounds the target's space, rendering her completely _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_ by hiding both the target and any water she displaces. Because of the bubble's size limit, this spell works only on _[[classes/Medium|Medium]]_ or smaller targets. Other objects and creatures within the bubble's space are also _invisible_ while they stay in the space, which could reveal the spell's existence to a canny observer who notices fish disappearing into the bubble and reappearing on the other side. Creatures inside the bubble can see each other, which allows foes who can pinpoint the bubble's location (such as dragons) to stick their heads into the bubble in order to see the target. Any creature on the inside of the bubble that takes any action that would break _[[spells/Invisibility|invisibility]]_ pops the bubble and ends the spell early. On land, the bubble is clearly visible, acting much as _invisibility_ does in the water. Unlike with _invisibility_, the inside of the bubble blocks light from escaping the bubble, meaning that light sources inside the bubble don't illuminate past its edges, but also don't reveal a telltale glow.
