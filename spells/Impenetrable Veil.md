  "You enchant the target so it is nearly impossible to detect by both magical and mundane means, granting it the following benefits. The target gains a bonus on Stealth checks equal to half your caster level, and can use Stealth to hide from all creatures attempting to perceive it, even when it lacks concealment or cover. It can attempt a Stealth check to avoid detection from creatures using blindsight, blindsense, or any ability that functions as either (such as lifesense or tremorsense).

If a creature attempts to discern the target's presence or location using divination magic (including magic items with a divination aura such as a _crystal_ ball), that creature must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to the target's Stealth bonus to discern any information about the target, and on a failed check cannot do so for the spell's duration."

 #### Description
You enchant the target so it is nearly impossible to detect by both magical and mundane means, granting it the following benefits. The target gains a bonus on Stealth checks equal to half your caster level, and can use Stealth to hide from all creatures attempting to perceive it, even when it lacks concealment or cover. It can attempt a Stealth check to avoid detection from creatures using _[[universal monster rules/Blindsight|blindsight]]_, _[[universal monster rules/Blindsense|blindsense]]_, or any ability that functions as either (such as _[[universal monster rules/Lifesense|lifesense]]_ or _[[universal monster rules/Tremorsense|tremorsense]]_). Furthermore, the target leaves no trail and cannot be tracked unless it chooses to leave a trail. If a creature attempts to discern the target's presence or location using _[[spells/Divination|divination]]_ magic (including magic items with a _divination_ aura such as a crystal ball), that creature must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to the target's Stealth bonus to discern any information about the target, and on a failed check cannot do so for the spell's duration.
