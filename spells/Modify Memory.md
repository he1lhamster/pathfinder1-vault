  "You reach into the subject's mind and modify as many as 5 minutes of its memories in one of the following ways.
  
  * Eliminate all memory of an event the subject actually experienced. This spell cannot negate _charm, geas/quest, suggestion,_ or similar spells.

  * Change the details of an event the subject actually experienced.
  * Implant a memory of an event the subject never experienced.
  
  Casting the spell takes 1 round.

If your concentration is disturbed before the visualization is complete, or if the subject is ever beyond the spell's range during this time, the spell is lost.
  A modified memory does not necessarily affect the subject's actions, particularly if it contradicts the creature's natural inclinations. An illogical modified memory is dismissed by the creature as a bad dream, too much wine, or another similar excuse."
