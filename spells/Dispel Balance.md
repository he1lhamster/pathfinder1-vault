 #### Description
Pulsing bronze energy surrounds you, bestowing three effects. First, you gain a +3 _[[spells/Deflection|deflection]]_ bonus to AC against attacks by chaotic neutral, lawful neutral, neutral evil, and neutral good creatures. Against attacks by creatures whose alignment is neutral with no other alignment components, this _deflection_ bonus is instead +5. Second, upon making a successful melee touch attack against a creature from another plane with a neutral component to its alignment, you can banish that creature back to its home plane. The creature's _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ applies to this attempt, and the creature can negate this effect with a successful Will save. If the creature's alignment is neutral with no other alignment components, the creature takes a -2 penalty on this saving throw. This use discharges and ends the spell. Third, with a touch, you can automatically dispel any one enchantment spell cast by a creature with a neutral component to its alignment. Spells that can't be dispelled by _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ also can't be dispelled by _[[spells/Dispel Balance|dispel balance]]_. **Saving Throw**s and _spell resistance_ do not apply to this effect. This use discharges and ends the spell.
