  "This spell enables you to make a _snare_ that functions as a magic trap. The _snare_ can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When you cast _snare_ upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings (DC 23 Perception check for a character with the trapfinding ability to locate). One end of the _snare_ is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle.
  If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the _snare_ can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend, straightening when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens around the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be entangled.
  The _snare_ is magical. To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength check that is a full-round action. The _snare_ has AC 7 and 5 hit points. A successful escape from the _snare_ breaks the loop and ends the spell."

 #### Description
This spell enables you to make a _[[spells/Snare|snare]]_ that functions as a magic trap. The _snare_ can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When you cast _snare_ upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings (DC 23 Perception check for a character with the trapfinding ability to locate). One end of the _snare_ is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle.
  If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the _snare_ can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend, straightening when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens around the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_.
  The _snare_ is magical. To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength check that is a full-round action. The _snare_ has AC 7 and 5 hit points. A successful escape from the _snare_ breaks the loop and ends the spell.
