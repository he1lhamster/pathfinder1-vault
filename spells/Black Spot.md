  "The _black spot_ is a specific and feared pirate curse. An intangible, illusory _black spot_ manifests above the target's head and remains until the target dies or the curse is lifted. The _black spot_ cannot be covered or hidden by any means, including other illusions.
  The _black spot_ radiates a cursed aura in a 10-foot radius around its target. Anyone within the aura gains a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against the target. In addition, the target has a -4 penalty on saving throws against death effects.
  Every day in which a creature bears a _black spot_, it must make a Fortitude save. On a failed save, the creature takes 1 point of Constitution damage. The damage cannot be healed until the _black spot_ is removed. If the creature's Constitution reaches 0, it dies. Pirates killed by this spell often return as ghosts, but that is not a direct effect of this spell.
  The _black spot_ cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with _break enchantment_, _limited _wish_, _miracle_, _remove curse_, or _wish_."
