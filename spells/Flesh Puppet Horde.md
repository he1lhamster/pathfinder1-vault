  "This spell functions as _flesh puppet_, but can animate multiple zombies.

A separate string attaches to each zombie in your horde. Severing a zombie's string reverts that zombie to a corpse, but doesn't end the spell for other zombies. Because commanding a _flesh puppet_ requires a swift action, you can issue commands to only one zombie per round, though zombies you previously commanded continue to follow their orders. Likewise, you can command only one zombie to speak per round. Unlike with _flesh puppet_, you can command a zombie to attack. If you do, all your zombies immediately gain the staggered quality and no longer appear to be alive. This spell ends automatically if you cast _flesh puppet_ or _flesh puppet_ horde on a new corpse."

 #### Description
This spell functions as _[[spells/Flesh Puppet|flesh puppet]]_, but can animate multiple zombies. As noted in _[[spells/Animate Dead|animate dead]]_, you can't control more than 4 HD per caster level worth of undead in total, nor can a single casting create more than 2 HD per caster level. A separate string attaches to each zombie in your horde. Severing a zombie's string reverts that zombie to a corpse, but doesn't end the spell for other zombies. Because commanding a _flesh puppet_ requires a swift action, you can issue commands to only one zombie per round, though zombies you previously commanded continue to follow their orders. Likewise, you can _[[spells/Command|command]]_ only one zombie to speak per round. Unlike with _flesh puppet_, you can _command_ a zombie to attack. If you do, all your zombies immediately gain the _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ quality and no longer appear to be alive. This spell ends automatically if you cast _flesh puppet_ or _[[spells/Flesh Puppet Horde|flesh puppet horde]]_ on a new corpse.
