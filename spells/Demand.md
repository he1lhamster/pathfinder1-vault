  "This spell functions like _sending_, but the message can also contain a _suggestion_ (see the _suggestion_ spell), which the subject does its best to carry out. A successful Will save negates the _suggestion_ effect but not the contact itself. The _demand_, if received, is understood even if the subject's Intelligence score is as low as 1. If the message is impossible or meaningless according to the circumstances that exist for the subject at the time the _demand_ is issued, the message is understood but the _suggestion_ is ineffective.
  The _demand's_ message to the creature must be 25 words or less, including the _suggestion_. The creature can also give a short reply immediately."
