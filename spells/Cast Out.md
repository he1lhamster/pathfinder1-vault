 #### Description
With a melee touch attack you blast a single creature and disrupt any magic controlling it. The target takes 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). In addition, you make a dispel check against any _[[spells/Magic Jar|magic jar]]_ effect (including a _[[monsters/Ghost|ghost]]_'s malevolence ability) or enchantment (compulsion) spells on the target creature, starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells. Treat this as a targeted _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ spell, except _[[spells/Cast Out|cast out]]_ can dispel one such spell for every four caster levels you possess. A successful Will save halves the damage and limits the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Dispelling|dispelling]]_ to a single spell or effect.
