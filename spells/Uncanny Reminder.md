This spell creates an _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Animated|animated]]_ replica of the target drawn from the target's subconscious. This living memory is an _animated_ form of the target's negative thoughts and emotions and is intent on destroying the target entirely. The living memory appears to be an exact replica of the target creature, but upon inspection it is obviously a construct. It uses the statistics of a clockwork angel except that it has an Intelligence of 10 and does not have the clockwork trait, the enhance weapon ability, or _[[curses/Vulnerability|vulnerability]]_ to electricity. If the living memory is destroyed, it vanishes entirely, including any replicas of equipment.You do not control the living memory. The living memory constantly attacks the target. The nature of the living memory causes the target to become unsettled. Roll on the following table to determine how the target acts while the living memory is in sight. If the result offers a saving throw, the DC is equal to that of this spell. The result remains in effect for as long as the living memory is in sight.
