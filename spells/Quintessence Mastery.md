  "This spell grants the caster limited control over the quintessence of an Outer Plane. The control granted by _quintessence mastery_ can take one of two forms_, _depending on the version of the spell_ cast. Both versions can be cast only on one of the nine Outer Planes, for it is these planes, not the Transitive or Inner Planes, that are comprised of quintessence. **Planewarp**: This allows the caster to _create_ various objects or effects. When this spell is cast, you can replicate a number of effects from one or more of the following spells: _control water_, _diminish plants_, _fog cloud_, _major creation_, _move earth_, _plant growth_, _secure shelter_, _soften earth and stone_, _spike growth_, _spike stones_, _stone shape_, _transmute mud to rock_, _transmute rock to mud_, _wall of stone_, or _wall of thorns_. The total spell levels of effects to be _create_d must not exceed 8. For example, you could use this spell to replicate the effects of _fog cloud_, _secure shelter_, and _soften earth and stone_ (since these three spells have levels that add up to 8) or _diminish plants_ and _spike stones_ (since these two spells have levels that add up to 7), but not _move earth_ and _plant growth_ (since these two spells have levels that add up to 9). If a spell appears on different spell lists at different levels, use the lowest level-_control water_, for example, counts as a 4th-level spell even though it's a 6th-level spell for sorcerers and wizards. This list need not be exhaustive; at the GM's discretion, this list may be expanded to include similar spells from other sources or similarly themed effects that do not mimic specific spells. This version of the spell has a casting time of 1 round and lasts for 1 hour per caster level or until its effects are expended. **Shape Realm**: This functions similarly to _create_ demiplane, except that it alters an equivalent area of the plane the caster is on rather than creating a self-contained realm on the Astral or Ethereal Plane. You cannot grant the affected area an alignment or essence trait opposed by the plane's traits (such as granting the lawful-aligned trait to a portion of Elysium), and the area is not self-contained. At the GM's discretion, additional restrictions beyond those listed in the _create_ demiplane spell may limit this spell's effects, and additional options for customizing the affected area may be available. This version of the spell has a casting time of 4 hours and lasts for 1 day per caster level. This version of _quintessence mastery_ can be made permanent in the same way and for the same cost as _create_ demiplane. This version of _quintessence mastery_ does not function within the boundaries of a divine realm."

 #### Description
This spell grants the caster limited control over the _[[spells/Quintessence|quintessence]]_ of an Outer Plane. The control granted by _[[spells/Quintessence Mastery|quintessence mastery]]_ can take one of two forms, depending on the version of the spell cast. Both versions can be cast only on one of the nine Outer Planes, for it is these planes, not the Transitive or Inner Planes, that are comprised of _quintessence_. **Planewarp**: This allows the caster to create various objects or effects. When this spell is cast, you can replicate a number of effects from one or more of the following spells: _[[spells/Control Water|control water]]_, _[[spells/Diminish Plants|diminish plants]]_, _[[spells/Fog Cloud|fog cloud]]_, _[[spells/Major Creation|major creation]]_, _[[spells/Move Earth|move earth]]_, _[[spells/Plant Growth|plant growth]]_, _[[spells/Secure Shelter|secure shelter]]_, _[[spells/Soften Earth and Stone|soften earth and stone]]_, _[[spells/Spike Growth|spike growth]]_, _[[spells/Spike Stones|spike stones]]_, _[[spells/Stone Shape|stone shape]]_, _[[spells/Transmute Mud to Rock|transmute mud to rock]]_, _[[spells/Transmute Rock to Mud|transmute rock to mud]]_, _[[spells/Wall Of Stone|wall of stone]]_, or _[[spells/Wall Of Thorns|wall of thorns]]_. The total spell levels of effects to be created must not exceed 8. For example, you could use this spell to replicate the effects of _fog cloud_, _secure shelter_, and _soften earth and stone_ (since these three spells have levels that add up to 8) or _diminish plants_ and _spike stones_ (since these two spells have levels that add up to 7), but not _move earth_ and _plant growth_ (since these two spells have levels that add up to 9). If a spell appears on different spell lists at different levels, use the lowest level-control water, for example, counts as a 4th-level spell even though it's a 6th-level spell for sorcerers and wizards. This list need not be exhaustive; at the GM's discretion, this list may be expanded to include similar spells from other sources or similarly themed effects that do not _[[monsters/Mimic|mimic]]_ specific spells. This version of the spell has a casting time of 1 round and lasts for 1 hour per caster level or until its effects are expended. **Shape Realm**: This functions similarly to _[[spells/Create Demiplane|create demiplane]]_, except that it alters an equivalent area of the plane the caster is on rather than creating a self-contained realm on the Astral or Ethereal Plane. You cannot grant the affected area an alignment or essence trait opposed by the plane's traits (such as granting the lawful-aligned trait to a portion of Elysium), and the area is not self-contained.
