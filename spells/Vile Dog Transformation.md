 #### Description
You transform one or more dogs into evil, monstrous creatures. Each _[[monsters/Dog|dog]]_ can attempt a Will save to negate the _[[spells/Transformation|transformation]]_, but if the _dog_ trusts you (it has been trained by you for a purpose, or has been in your care for at least 30 days and generally treated well), it takes a -4 penalty on this saving throw. Each transformed _dog_ has the same stats as a _[[monsters/Hell Hound|hell hound]]_ (Bestiary 173) except that it doesn't have fire _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ and cold _[[curses/Vulnerability|vulnerability]]_ and instead has acid, cold, and fire _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ 5. Additionally, each transformed _dog_ deals an extra 1d6 points of acid damage with its bite attack (instead of fire damage), and its _[[universal monster rules/Breath Weapon|breath weapon]]_ is replaced with a vaporous cloud that spreads out in front of the creature in a 10-foot cone, dealing 2d4 points of acid damage. The creature can't understand Infernal but understands any languages you know. The _dog_ is normally neutral evil, but is chaotic evil if you are chaotic or lawful evil if you are lawful. For every 3 caster levels you have, you can transform one _dog_ (to a maximum of five dogs at 15th level). At the end of the spell's duration, the dogs immediately dissolve into a stinking pile of gore and bones. You can _[[spells/Command|command]]_ the creature in the same way you would a creature you summoned via a _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ monster spell. If you buy dogs to use with this spell, they cost 15 gp for a lap _dog_, 25 gp for a _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_ _dog_, or 150 gp for a riding _dog_ (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 82). Any kind of _dog_ can be transformed by this spell and has the same statistics.
