 #### Description
You instantly change the appearance of the subjects and then maintain that appearance for the spell's duration. You can make the subjects appear to be anything you _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_. The subjects look, feel, and smell just like the creatures the spell makes them resemble. Affected creatures resume their normal appearances if slain. You must succeed on a Disguise check to duplicate the appearance of a specific individual. This spell gives you a +10 bonus on the check.
  Unwilling targets can negate the spell's effect on them by making Will saves or with _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_. Those who interact with the subjects can attempt Will disbelief saves to see through the glamer, but _spell resistance_ doesn't help.
