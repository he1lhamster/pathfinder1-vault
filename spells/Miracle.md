  "You don't so much cast a _miracle_ as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede.
  A _miracle_ can do any of the following things.
  
  * Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower.
  * Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.
  * Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as _feeblemind_ or _insanity._
  * Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.
  
  Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting such a _miracle_ costs the cleric 25,000 gp in powdered diamond because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful _miracle_s of this sort could include the following:
  
  * Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.
  * Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to a specific locale through planar barriers with no chance of error.
  * Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.
  
  In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's (or alignment's) nature is refused.
  A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a _miracle_ spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component."

 #### Description
You don't so much cast a _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_ as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede.
  A _miracle_ can do any of the following things.
  
  * Duplicate any _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ spell of 8th level or lower.
  * Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.
  * Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as _[[spells/Feeblemind|feeblemind]]_ or _[[spells/Insanity|insanity]]_.
  * Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.
  
  Alternatively, a _cleric_ can make a very powerful request. Casting such a _miracle_ costs the _cleric_ 25,000 gp in powdered diamond because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful miracles of this sort could include the following:
  
  * Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising _[[monsters/Fallen|fallen]]_ allies to continue fighting.
  * Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to a specific locale through _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Planar|planar]]_ barriers with no chance of error.
  * Protecting a city from an _[[spells/Earthquake|earthquake]]_, _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Volcanic|volcanic]]_ eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.
  
  In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's (or alignment's) nature is refused.
  A duplicated spell allows saving throws and _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a _miracle_ spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.
