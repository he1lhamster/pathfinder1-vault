  "You place a magical command upon a creature to seek out and destroy a single enemy that has inflicted some perceived or actual harm to the target.

  If you designate one of the target's friends or loved ones as the enemy, the target gains another saving throw to overcome the spell as soon as it enters combat with the enemy."
