 #### Description
The _[[spells/Shambler|shambler]]_ spell creates 1d4+2 shambling mounds with the advanced template (see the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). The creatures willingly aid you in combat or battle, perform a specific mission, or serve as bodyguards. The creatures remain with you for 7 days unless you dismiss them. If the shamblers are created only for _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_ duty, however, the duration of the spell is 7 months. In this case, the shamblers can only be ordered to _guard_ a specific site or location. Shamblers summoned to _guard_ duty cannot move outside the spell's range, which is measured from the point where each first appeared. You can only have one _shambler_ spell in at one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled. The shamblers have _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ to fire as normal shambling mounds do only if the terrain where they are summoned is rainy, marshy, or damp.
