  "This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible.

  If an _arcane mark_ is placed on a living being, the effect gradually fades in about a month.
  _Arcane mark_ must be cast on an object prior to casting _instant summons_ on the same object (see that spell description for details)."
