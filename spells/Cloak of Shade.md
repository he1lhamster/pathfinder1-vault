  "(harmless) This spell provides the subject with some degree of protection from the harmful effects of the sun. The cloaked subject treats environmental heat due to sun exposure as one level less: severe heat is considered very hot conditions, while very hot is considered average temperature (see page 444 of the _Core Rulebook_ for heat dangers). The _cloak of shade_ also reduces any penalties from sunlight by 1. The spell does not, however, eliminate the effects of direct sunlight on creatures vulnerable to sunlight. _Cloak of shade_ has no effect on environmental heat from sources other than the sun."
