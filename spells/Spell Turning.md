  "Spells and spell-like effects targeted on you are turned back upon the original caster. The abjuration turns only spells that have you as a target. Effect and area spells are not affected. _Spell turning_ also fails to stop touch range spells. From seven to ten (1d4+6) spell levels are affected by the turning. The exact number is rolled secretly.
  When you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount of _spell turning_ you have left, that spell is partially turned. Subtract the amount of _spell turning_ left from the spell level of the incoming spell, then divide the result by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect gets through. For damaging spells, you and the caster each take a fraction of the damage. For nondamaging spells, each of you has a proportional chance to be the one who is affected. If you and a spellcasting attacker are both warded by _spell turning_ effects in operation, a resonating field is created. Roll randomly to determine the result.

 #### Description
Spells and spell-like effects targeted on you are turned back upon the original caster. The abjuration turns only spells that have you as a target. Effect and area spells are not affected. _[[spells/Spell Turning|Spell turning]]_ also fails to stop touch range spells. From seven to ten (1d4+6) spell levels are affected by the turning. The exact number is rolled secretly.
  When you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount of _spell turning_ you have left, that spell is partially turned. Subtract the amount of _spell turning_ left from the spell level of the incoming spell, then divide the result by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect gets through. For damaging spells, you and the caster each take a fraction of the damage. For nondamaging spells, each of you has a proportional chance to be the one who is affected. If you and a spellcasting attacker are both warded by _spell turning_ effects in operation, a _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Resonating|resonating]]_ field is created. Roll randomly to determine the result.
