 #### Description
You reshape the substance of a willing undead creature to resemble a living, breathing creature of the same size. This is a physical change to the undead creature's bone, flesh, or _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ ectoplasm, adding new flesh or bone and even hair, teeth, and blood, all of which demonstrate false signs of life that _[[monsters/Mimic|mimic]]_ a living creature's breathing and other physiological processes. An _incorporeal_ undead creature using _[[spells/Daywalker|daywalker]]_ ceases to be _incorporeal_ for the duration of the spell, gaining a physical corpse body. Creatures interacting with the undead can attempt a Perception check (DC = 30 or DC = 21 + the undead's Disguise modifier, whichever is higher) to realize that the signs of life are false, and a close examination with a _[[spells/Heal|Heal]]_ check always reveals the truth of the dead flesh. If the undead has the _[[universal monster rules/Frightful Presence|frightful presence]]_, _incorporeal_, _[[universal monster rules/Light Blindness|light blindness]]_, _[[universal monster rules/Light Sensitivity|light sensitivity]]_, _[[universal monster rules/Stench|stench]]_, _[[universal monster rules/Sunlight Powerlessness|sunlight powerlessness]]_, or _[[universal monster rules/Unnatural Aura|unnatural aura]]_ abilities, the spell suppresses them. An undead creature whose touch normally deals damage, ability drain, or _[[universal monster rules/Energy Drain|energy drain]]_ doesn't do so while under the spell's effects. The target of this spell may end its duration at any time as a standard action.
