 #### Description
You create a luminescent sphere of orbiting energy that harms _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ creatures and dispossesses them of any stolen bodies. An _incorporeal_ creature must succeed at a Will save to enter a space overlapping with the sphere; failure means the creature cannot pass through the sphere, as though it were a _[[spells/Wall Of Force|wall of force]]_. If the _incorporeal_ creature succeeds, it may pass through the sphere at will, though if it ends its turn within the sphere, it takes a number of points of force damage equal to 1d6 + 1 per caster level (maximum +10).
  If a creature possessing another creature's body (via either _[[spells/Magic Jar|magic jar]]_ or a similar effect) enters a _[[spells/Sphere Of Warding|sphere of warding]]_, that creature is immediately ejected from its host body, the host's spirit returns to its body if it's able, and the _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_ immediately ends. When ejected, the body enters the sphere, while the possessing creature takes the appropriate amount of force damage (no save) and is shunted to the exterior of the sphere.
