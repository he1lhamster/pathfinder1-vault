  "This spell allows you to channel holy power into your sword, or any other melee weapon you choose. The weapon acts as a _+5 holy weapon_ (+5 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, extra 2d6 damage against evil opponents). It also emits a _magic circle_ against evil_ effect (as the spell).

  You cannot have more than one _holy sword_ at a time.

This spell is not cumulative with _bless weapon_ or any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way. This spell does not work on artifacts. A masterwork weapon's bonus to attack does not stack with an enhancement bonus to attack."
