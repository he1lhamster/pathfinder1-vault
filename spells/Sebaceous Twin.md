 #### Description
By touching a living target, you cause a half-formed, parasitic _[[spells/Clone|clone]]_ of the target to burst from its midsection. The twin dangles from the target's body, making it difficult for the target to move easily and imparting a -2 penalty on Acrobatics and _[[universal monster rules/Climb|Climb]]_ checks. In addition, for the spell's duration, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw at the start of its turn each round, or else it takes 1 point of Constitution damage and is _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ for that round as the twin siphons off its blood. Each time the target receives any healing (magical or otherwise), the duration of this spell is extended by 1 round. Each attack that deals damage to the target reduces the duration of this spell by 1 round. If the duration reaches 0 rounds in this manner, the twin is violently excised from the body, and the target takes 1d6 points of _[[universal monster rules/Bleed|bleed]]_ damage (which can be healed as normal). The effect of _[[spells/Sebaceous Twin|sebaceous twin]]_ counts as a disease effect with a DC equal to the spell's saving throw DC.
