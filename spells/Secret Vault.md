  "This spell functions like _secret chest_, except it affects a small structure, vault, or oversized chest. Living creatures within a _secret vault_ don't cause the spell to fail. While the vault is stored on the Ethereal Plane, living creatures within the vault don't need to eat, drink, or breathe, but they can't leave the vault except via magic such as _plane shift_. The vault used as a focus for _secret vault_ must cost at least 25,000 gp, and its replica costs 250 gp. A _secret vault_ has only a 1% cumulative chance per day of becoming irretrievably lost after 360 days."
