  "You create a semi-living intelligent draconic servant that loyally obeys and serves you.

Your _draconic ally_ can use its breath weapon once per day. Once conjured, the creature is not limited to the spell's range, and can go a considerable distance to carry out missions at your command. The _draconic ally_ speaks one language of your choice that you know. You cannot have more than one _draconic ally_ at a time. As long as a previous ally exists, you cannot successfully cast this spell again. If you have a breath weapon, you can cast this spell as a standard action by expending one use of your breath weapon as a free action when you cast the spell. Clerics, inquisitors, oracles, and warpriests who worship Apsu or Dahak add _draconic ally_ to their spell lists as a 3rd-level spell."
