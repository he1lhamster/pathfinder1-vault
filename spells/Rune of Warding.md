  "You inscribe a series of runes upon the surface of a door or around the border of an entryway. They function as a _glyph of warding_ (blast glyph), though unlike a _glyph of warding_, these runes are always visible. The runes count as a _glyph of warding_ for the purpose of what spells can defeat it, placing multiple glyphs in the same area, and so on."
