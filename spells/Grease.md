  "A _grease_ spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery _grease_. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. A creature can walk within or through the area of _grease_ at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this check and are not considered flat-footed.
  The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item.
  Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature requires its bearer to make a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the _grease_d item. A creature wearing _grease_d armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple, and to their CMD to avoid being grappled."

 #### Description
A _[[spells/Grease|grease]]_ spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery _grease_. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. A creature can walk within or through the area of _grease_ at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this check and are not considered _[[conditions/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]_.
  The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item.
  Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature requires its bearer to make a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased item. A creature wearing greased armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple, and to their CMD to avoid being _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_.
