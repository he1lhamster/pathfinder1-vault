The creature is paralyzed and held in place, but may attempt a new saving throw each round to end the effect. While held by the golden chains, a creature cannot use any sort of extradimensional travel, such as _astral projection_, _blink_, _dimension door_, _ethereal jaunt_, _etherealness_, _gate_, _maze_, _plane shift_, _shadow walk_, _teleport_, and similar spells and spell-like abilities. The spell does not affect creatures that are already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast."
