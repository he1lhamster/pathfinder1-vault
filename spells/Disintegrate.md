  "A thin, green ray springs from your pointing finger. You must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any creature struck by the ray takes 2d6 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6). Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected.
  When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted.
  The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as _forceful hand_ or a _wall of force_, but not magical effects such as a _globe of invulnerability_ or an _antimagic field_.
  A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is entirely disintegrated.
  Only the first creature or object struck can be affected; that is, the ray affects only one target per casting."

 #### Description
A thin, green ray springs from your pointing finger. You must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any creature struck by the ray takes 2d6 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6). Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected.
  When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted.
  The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as _[[spells/Forceful Hand|forceful hand]]_ or a _[[spells/Wall Of Force|wall of force]]_, but not magical effects such as a _[[spells/Globe Of Invulnerability|globe of invulnerability]]_ or an _[[spells/Antimagic Field|antimagic field]]_.
  A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is entirely disintegrated.
  Only the first creature or object struck can be affected; that is, the ray affects only one target per casting.
