  "You create a spherical magnetic field that surrounds you to a range of 30 feet and follows you for the duration of the spell.
  Unattended metal objects in range-including weapons, armor, and anything made primarily out of metal-are pulled violently toward you, stopping just short of your space and falling harmlessly to the ground. Objects secured to a nonmetallic fixture remain where they are unless a forceful tug would be enough to detach them. Loose objects weighing more than 500 pounds are not affected. If the magnetic field would cause a dangerous metal object such as a sword or anvil to intersect a square occupied by a creature, that creature must succeed at a Reflex save or take damage as if from an improvised weapon of the object's size (or smaller or larger, at the GM's discretion).
  A creature in the area wearing metal armor, wielding a metal weapon, or holding a metal object must succeed at a Reflex save or be dragged 5 feet closer to you in a straight line, as if affected by the pull universal monster rule (_Bestiary_ 303). A creature can drop a metal object it's holding as a free action to avoid the effect if it's not wearing metal armor; a creature being dragged by its shield can loosen it as a move action and drop it as a free action. Creatures made entirely or mostly of metal take a -2 penalty on their Reflex saves. Creatures that fail their saves by 5 or more are pulled an additional 5 feet closer for every increment of 5 by which they failed their saves."

 #### Description
You create a spherical _[[spells/Magnetic Field|magnetic field]]_ that surrounds you to a range of 30 feet and follows you for the duration of the spell.
  Unattended metal objects in range-including weapons, armor, and anything made primarily out of metal-are pulled violently toward you, stopping just short of your space and falling harmlessly to the ground. Objects secured to a nonmetallic fixture remain where they are unless a forceful tug would be enough to detach them. Loose objects weighing more than 500 pounds are not affected. If the _magnetic field_ would cause a dangerous metal object such as a sword or _[[items/Mundane/Anvil|anvil]]_ to intersect a square occupied by a creature, that creature must succeed at a Reflex save or take damage as if from an improvised weapon of the object's size (or smaller or larger, at the GM's discretion).
  A creature in the area wearing metal armor, wielding a metal weapon, or holding a metal object must succeed at a Reflex save or be dragged 5 feet closer to you in a straight line, as if affected by the _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ universal monster rule (Bestiary 303). A creature can drop a metal object it's holding as a free action to avoid the effect if it's not wearing metal armor; a creature being dragged by its _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ can loosen it as a move action and drop it as a free action. Creatures made entirely or mostly of metal take a -2 penalty on their Reflex saves. Creatures that fail their saves by 5 or more are pulled an additional 5 feet closer for every increment of 5 by which they failed their saves.
