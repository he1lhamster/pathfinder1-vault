  "This spell imbues an area with negative energy. The DC to resist negative channeled energy within this area gains a +3 profane bonus. Every undead creature entering a _desecrate_d_ area gains a +1 profane bonus on all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws.
  An undead creature created within or summoned into such an area gains +1 hit points per HD. If the _desecrate_d_ area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity or aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are doubled (+6 profane bonus to negative channeled energy DCs, +2 profane bonus and +2 hit points per HD for undead created in the area).
  Furthermore, anyone who casts _animate dead_ within this area may create as many as double the normal amount of undead (that is, 4 HD per caster level rather than 2 HD per caster level).
  If the area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture of a deity, pantheon, or higher power other than your patron, the _desecrate_ spell instead curses the area, cutting off its connection with the associated deity or power.
