 #### Description
With a single touch, you reduce a creature to a fumbling clown.
  The target takes a penalty to its Dexterity equal to 1d6+1 per two caster levels (maximum 1d6+5). This penalty cannot drop the target's Dexterity score below 1.
  In addition, if the subject moves more than half its speed, it falls _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_. If the subject flies, its maneuverability is reduced by one step (perfect maneuverability becomes good, good becomes average, and so on).
  A successful Fortitude save halves the penalty to Dexterity and negates the possibility of falling _prone_ or the reduction to fly maneuverabilities.
