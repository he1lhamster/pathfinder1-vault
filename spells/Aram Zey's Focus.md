  "Aram Zey created this spell for use by his students, both to increase their confidence in their skills and to ensure more of them survived encounters with deadly traps. If you don't have the trapfinding class ability, this spell grants you the trapfinding ability of a rogue of half your character level.
  If you have the trapfinding ability granted by class levels, however, this spell grants you a +5 competence bonus on all Disable Device checks made to disarm mechanical (but not magical) traps. While under the effects of Aram Zey's focus, whenever you trigger a trap by rolling poorly on a Disable Device check, you may roll a second Disable Device check. This new roll uses the same modifiers as the first roll. If your second roll is high enough to avoid accidentally springing the trap, you avoid setting it off, but still fail to disarm it. Each time you take advantage of this feature, the remaining duration of the spell is reduced by 1 minute-if less than a minute's worth of duration remains, the spell ends as soon as you reroll your Disable Device check."

 #### Description
Aram Zey created this spell for use by his students, both to increase their confidence in their skills and to ensure more of them survived encounters with _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ traps. If you don't have the trapfinding class ability, this spell grants you the trapfinding ability of a _[[classes/Rogue|rogue]]_ of half your character level.
  If you have the trapfinding ability granted by class levels, however, this spell grants you a +5 competence bonus on all Disable Device checks made to disarm mechanical (but not magical) traps. While under the effects of _[[spells/Aram Zey's Focus|Aram Zey's focus]]_, whenever you trigger a trap by rolling poorly on a Disable Device check, you may roll a second Disable Device check. This new roll uses the same modifiers as the first roll. If your second roll is high enough to avoid accidentally springing the trap, you avoid setting it off, but still fail to disarm it. Each time you take advantage of this feature, the remaining duration of the spell is reduced by 1 minute-if less than a minute's worth of duration remains, the spell ends as soon as you reroll your Disable Device check.
