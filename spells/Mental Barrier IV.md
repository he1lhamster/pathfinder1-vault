  "This spell functions as _mental barrier _II_I_, but if you are struck by a critical hit or sneak attack, there is a 25% chance that the additional damage is negated (as _light_ fortification). This does not stack with similar effects that negate the additional damage from a critical hit or sneak attack. In addition, you are immune to _mind thrust I_ and _II_, and you take half damage from _mind thrust I_II_, _I_V_, and _V_ (reduced to one-quarter on a successful Will save). This spell can be undercast."
