 #### Description
You are able to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within the size limit) to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension (to about 1/4,000 the original volume and mass). This change effectively reduces the object's size by four categories. Optionally, you can also change its now shrunken composition to a clothlike one.
  Objects changed by a _[[spells/Shrink Item|shrink item]]_ spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of _[[spells/Command|command]]_ from the original caster. Even a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Burning|burning]]_ fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this spell. Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and composition ends the spell.
  _Shrink item_ can be made permanent with a _[[spells/Permanency|permanency]]_ spell, in which case the affected object can be shrunk and expanded an indefinite number of times, but only by the original caster.
