  "A scarf you are wearing frays at the end into hook-like shapes and can extend to incredible lengths. Although your scarf retains its weight, its frayed ends function as a grappling hook that can be thrown with a range increment of 20 feet. Your scarf elongates to 100 feet the first time it is thrown during the spell duration. Regardless of its apparent material, the scarf is as strong and easy to climb as a knotted silk rope. At the end of the duration, the scarf detaches and returns to its former shape, fluttering down from its position if you haven't already retrieved it."
