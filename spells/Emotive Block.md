 #### Description
You create an emotional block in the target's mind, adding an emotion component to each spell or spell-like ability he uses. This is in addition to any other components the spell already requires, and doesn't replace the somatic component. The target's _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ require this emotion component, even though they normally don't need spell components. As usual with emotion components, the target can't cast spells (or use _spell-like abilities_, in this case) while affected by a non-harmless emotion or _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effect.
