 #### Description
You speak a short _[[spells/Message|message]]_ (up to 10 words per caster level), implanting both it and the identity of the _message_'s intended recipient in the mind of a willing creature. The creature is aware of the _message_ and who the recipient is.
  Any attempt to speak, write, or otherwise communicate the _message_ to anyone other than its intended recipient causes the target to forget the _message_ for 1d6 minutes. Attempts to read the target's mind (such as with _[[spells/Detect Thoughts|detect thoughts]]_) or to force the target to reveal the _message_ (such as with torture or magical compulsion) likewise cause temporary _[[spells/Amnesia|amnesia]]_ regarding the _message_.
  The target can communicate the _message_ only to someone it believes is the intended recipient, which means that disguises, illusions, and _[[spells/Polymorph|polymorph]]_ effects might fool the target into delivering the _message_. Once the target communicates the _message_, the _message_ is permanently erased from the target's memory.
