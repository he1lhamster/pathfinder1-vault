  "When you cast this spell, you can assume the form of any _Small_ or _Medium_ corporeal creature of the undead type, which must be vaguely humanoid-shaped (like a ghoul, skeleton, or zombie). You gain a bite attack (1d6 for _Medium_ forms, 1d4 for _Small_ forms), two claw or slam attacks (1d6 for _Medium_ forms, 1d4 for _Small_ forms), and darkvision 60 feet. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: climb 30 feet, fly 30 feet (average maneuverability), swim 30 feet, low-light vision, and scent.
  In this form, you detect as an undead creature (such as with _detect undead_, but not with magic that reveals your _true_ form, such as _true_ seeing) and are treated as undead for the purposes of channeled energy, _cure_ spells, and _inflict_ spells, but not for other effects that specifically target or react differently to undead (such as _searing_ light).
  _Small_ undead: If the form you take is that of a _Small_ undead, you gain a +2 size bonus to your Dexterity and a +1 natural armor bonus.
  _Medium_ undead: If the form you take is that of a _Medium_ undead, you gain a +2 size bonus to your Strength and a +2 natural armor bonus."
