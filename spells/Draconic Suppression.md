  "A dragon that fails its saving throw cannot use its breath weapon for the duration of the spell and is treated as one age category younger for determining which special abilities it can use. For example, an ancient green dragon would revert to the special abilities of a very old dragon and lose access to its miasma ability and its _dominate person_ spell-like ability. This spell has no effect on a dragon's armor class, feats, frightful presence, hit points, physical attacks, saving throws, senses, size, skills, spellcasting, or statistics."
