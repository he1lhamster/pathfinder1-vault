  special:
  - flurry of blows
  - quivering palm (1/day, DC 27)
  - stunning fist (20/day, DC 27)
tactics:
  Before Combat: The monk drinks his potions of barkskin and bear's endurance.
  During Combat: The monk expends a point from his ki pool at the beginning of combat
    to increase his speed. He then closes with a single opponent to deliver an Improved
    Vital Strike combined with Stunning Fist. If successful, he makes a full attack
    with his flurry of blows in the next round, attempting to finish the hampered
    opponent. He uses this tactic whenever possible, using flurry of blows or Power
    Attack only against targets that have already had their AC compromised from being
    stunned or tripped. Otherwise, he uses his mobility and high Acrobatics skill
    to move in and out of melee. When fighting four or more opponents, the monk activates
    his feather token (whip) and targets spellcasters first with Stunning Fist combined
    with Medusa's Wrath.
  Base Statistics: Without barkskin and bear's endurance, the monk's statistics are
    AC 32, touch 27, flat-footed 29; hp 113; Fort +16; Con 10.
