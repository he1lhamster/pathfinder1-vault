desc_long: |-
  Burglars are prowlers of cities and towns, dancing catlike along rooftops and slipping quietly into homes and shops by night.

  Changing Skill Focus (Perception) to Skill Focus (Disable Device) turns a burglar into an expert safecracker, while replacing Deft Hands and Skill Focus (Perception) with Point Blank Shot and Weapon Focus (shortbow) makes a skulking sniper. Replacing Skill Focus (Perception) with Skill Focus (Acrobatics), and changing the quick disable rogue talent to ledge walker or stand up creates a thief-acrobat. Changing a burglar's rogue talent is a good way to customize further.

  Burglars usually work alone but will sometimes hire a pickpocket as a lookout (CR 3). A trio of burglars might cooperate to rob a large house or bank, with three street thugs for muscle and a pickpocket lookout (CR 7). A burglar may also work in concert with a barkeep and barmaid (CR 5) to rob patrons' rooms of valuables.
