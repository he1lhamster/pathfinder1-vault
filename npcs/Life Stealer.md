tactics:
  Before Combat: The barbarian uses stealth and deception to get close to enemies
    without them noticing, and uses his chime of opening to break into locked strongholds.
  During Combat: The barbarian tries to disarm opponents at the beginning of combat,
    using poison against a target's weakest ability score if he knows his target in
    advance. He triggers his mighty swing on a sword critical that might slay his
    target, and uses his rage-enhanced senses to find creatures trying to hide or
    flee. He uses his buckler when faced with many foes, but against lone targets
    uses his nine lives stealer for two-handed Power Attacks.
  Base Statistics: When not raging, the barbarian's statistics are AC 22, touch 13,
    flat-footed 19; hp 155; Fort +14, Will +7; no bonus vs. spells and spell-like
    or supernatural abilities, no bonus vs. enchantments; Melee nine lives stealer
