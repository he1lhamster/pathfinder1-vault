  birth, but all seek to trade blood for gold and glory. Many emphasize quickness
  and defense over brute strength, sizing up their foe before leaping into a blood
  fury with sword and shield. Gladiators can be used as bodyguards, riot police in
  a city, or elite military skirmishers. Replacing Dodge with Exotic Weapon Proficency
  creates an exotic weapon master. Outside the arena, gladiators are rarely found
  without a pair of drunkards to help celebrate their latest victory (CR 6).
