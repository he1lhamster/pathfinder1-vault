  Well-rounded in her training, the princess is a demure lady of the court who handles herself quite well in a fight. She has a stubborn streak and a taste for adventure, and doesn't like commoners telling her what she can and can't do.

  Most of her remaining wealth is in the form of fine jewelry, such as rings, necklaces, a tiara, or a scepter. These items are quite recognizable as belonging to the royal family and sure to cause suspicion if they are found in the hands of anyone else.
