tactics:
  Before Combat: Well in advance of battle, the fighter activates her bronze griffon
    and saddles and armors it. Before the fighting starts, she mounts her griffon,
    takes to the air, and quaffs her potion of heroism.
  During Combat: The fighter flies above the battlefield taking passes with her lance,
    never flying lower than 10 feet above the ground. If outmatched in melee, she
    retreats to higher altitude and uses her bow. A griffon rider loves to unseat
    other mounted combatants, particularly if they're flying. She keeps a plentiful
    supply of alchemist's fire in case any flammable targets present themselves.
  Base Statistics: Without heroism, the fighter's statistics are Senses Perception
    +13; Fort +9, Ref +5, Will +4; Melee mwk lance +16/+11 (1d8+4/×3) or flail +12/+7
    (1d8+2); Ranged mwk composite longbow +14/+9 (1d8+3/×3); CMB +12; Skills Handle
    Animal +8, Perception +13, Ride +17.
