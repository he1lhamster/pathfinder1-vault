tactics:
  Before Combat: The monk conceals her shuriken as the metal cymbals inside her tambourine,
    applying 2 doses of black adder venom or drow poison to the weapons before combat.
    She performs, bluffs, or connives her way to her target.
  During Combat: If the monk finds herself outnumbered, she uses flurry of blows with
    her poisoned shuriken. She shifts and feints through a melee. If her feint is
    successful, she trips that foe. Once the foe is on the ground, she slams down
    with a Stunning Fist. A poisonous performer does not hesitate to abandon combat
    if outmatched or seriously injured, drinking her potion of invisibility and fleeing
    the field to a place where she can drink a potion of disguise self, blend in,
    and disappear.
