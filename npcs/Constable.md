desc_long: |-
  A gruff, no-nonsense sort, a constable prefers a stern warning to violence, but doesn't hesitate to crack a belligerent nuisance over the head.

  Depending on the size of the town she protects, the constable's minions may include guards (warriors 3), a larger number of recruits (warriors 1), and perhaps a tavern champion (warrior 5). In a smaller community, she may only be able to gather a group of pig farmers (commoners 2) and perhaps some miners (commoners 4) to serve as a militia. Unless dealing with monsters, the constable's job is to arrest and detain, not kill.
