  typically make up the majority of a pirate ship's crew of sailors, as they possess
  both the skill and brawn necessary for day-to-day raids and heists. These colorful,
  adventurous characters chafe at society's laws and restrictions, and the exciting
  life of the buccaneer is well suited to pirates' ferocious independence.
