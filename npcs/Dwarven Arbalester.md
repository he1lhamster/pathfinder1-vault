tactics:
  Before Combat: The fighter applies oil of greater magic weapon to his heavy crossbow,
    then drinks potions of barkskin and heroism.
  During Combat: For as long as he can, the fighter stays mounted and takes shots
    from long range. He takes most shots with magical ammunition, tailoring the bolt
    to the foe. He uses Greater Vital Strike unless he has trouble hitting, in which
    case he switches to Pinpoint Targeting. He nearly always uses Deadly Aim.
