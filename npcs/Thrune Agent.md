  II herself. Though the Chelish government has few qualms against performing evil
  acts in the name of maintaining the law and the nation's place in the Inner Sea
  region, some actions are performed less in Cheliax's best interest than they are
  in the interest of for family that rules the nation. Whether acting as spies among
  rival noble houses or suspected rebel groups, serving as enforcers of the will of
  the House of Thrune, or simply making sure they're seen violently carrying out the
  orders of Her Infernal Majestrix to intimidate the populace, Thrune agents are feared
  throughout Cheliax and beyond. Some claim that to become a trusted agent of the
  House of Thrune, prospective agents must enter into three distinct infernal pacts,
  binding the mind, soul, and body to Abrogail to ensure loyalty.
