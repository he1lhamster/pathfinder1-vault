tactics:
  Before Combat: The monk drinks potions of barkskin and cat's grace.
  During Combat: This monk prefers to use improvised weapons like ladders, tankards,
    and chisels. If he happens upon a particularly effective and sturdy improvised
    weapon, he applies oil of greater magic weapon before rejoining the fray. In familiar
    terrain, he tries to stun or trip a foe as a standard action and then uses his
    abundant step ability to seek cover where he can hide. The dwarf then pelts his
    adversaries with anything on hand.
