  Filled with bluster and swagger, a recruit lacks the discipline of an experienced soldier and can quickly lose resolve if he finds himself in over his head. A recruit works best in a large group under a strong leader who can keep all the soldiers in line and working together.

  Left to his own devices, a recruit becomes bored and looks for entertainments such as drinking and gambling to pass the time.
