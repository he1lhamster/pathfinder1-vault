npc_boon: A queen can arrange an audience with any noble in her land, including the
  king, and her favor provides a +10 bonus on Diplomacy checks with them. A queen
  who rules in her own name can also grant knighthoods, lordships, and dispense royal
  justice as a king.
desc_long: |-
  A queen may be a monarch in her own right, or may be the wife of a king. Even in the latter case, she shares many of the duties of rulership, including managing affairs of state while the king is absent. A queen is generally wise and thoughtful, carefully considering the health of her nation as well as her royal house.

  In countries or empires with a large number of titled families, a queen could simply be a duchess, baroness, or head of a great noble house, without royal privilege. A queen might also be used as a spymistress or the conniving seductress who holds the reins of power behind the throne.

  Queens are often accompanied by a knight or sellsword bodyguard (CR 11), or four princesses or two nobles serving as their ladies-in-waiting (CR 12). A queen might also have a celebrity bard with her, or a priest and noble as her advisors (CR 12). A queen may often be found with her husband, the king, along with their royal guardsmen, either eight guards or four guard officers (CR 15).
