desc_long: A wise sage's cantankerous manner evaporates when she's expounding on matters
  of scholarly minutia. The sage's breadth of general knowledge allows her to speak
  on most topics, and her precious magic items let her gain enough clues to direct
  her further research. If she reaches her limit on a topic, she may refer the questioner
  to a specialist in that field-or she may not, in order to preserve her pride.
