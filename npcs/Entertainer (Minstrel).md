desc_long: |-
  A minstrel is a professional bard, an accomplished performer used to playing at festivals and lordly tables. He is a versatile performer but specializes in song, story, and especially the playing of the lute, lyre, harp, and other stringed instruments.

  A minstrel down on his luck might play for a barkeep (CR 6). Two minstrels could be the apprentices of a celebrity bard (CR 11), while a troupe of three minstrels might play for a noble (CR 10) or even a king and queen (CR 15).
