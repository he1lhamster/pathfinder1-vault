tactics:
  Before Combat: The monk often tries to reason or treat with potential foes in an
    effort to avoid unnecessary combat, or to quietly study enemies and discern each
    one's strengths and weaknesses. Once combat is unavoidable, he drinks potions
    of barkskin and bull's strength.
  During Combat: The monk trusts his improved evasion, high saves, and spell resistance
    to safeguard him against spellcasters, and focuses on martial opponents, combining
    Spring Attack and Stunning Fist. He uses Lunge against Small or Medium opponents,
    often using ki points to grant himself a bonus to AC and negate the penalty from
    using Lunge. When making a flurry of blows, he attempts a Stunning Fist on the
    first strike. He uses Snatch Arrows to return thrown weapons and Deadly Aim whenever
    he catches a weapon he is proficient with.
  Base Statistics: Without barkskin and bull's strength, the monk's statistics are
    AC 27, touch 25, flat-footed 22; Melee +1 unarmed strike +16/+11 (1d10+2) or +1
    unarmed strike flurry of blows +18/+18/+13/+13/+8 (1d10+1); Str 12; CMB +14; CMD
