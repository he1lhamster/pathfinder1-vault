tactics:
  Before Combat: The fighter uses her scrolls of bear's endurance, bull's strength,
    fly, and heroism.

    then moves in with her bastard sword, using her first attack to disarm. If facing
    a spellcaster, she uses a scroll of silence. If she disarms a particularly powerful
    weapon, she spends a round picking it up and stuffing it in her handy haversack.
