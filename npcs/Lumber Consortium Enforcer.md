  The Lumber Consortium maintains its monopoly on hardwood imports, exports, and manufacturing in much of Andoran by means of political manipulation and influence (both legal and otherwise), but employs gangs of enforcers to maintain its power and authority on a local level. Some Lumber Consortium enforcers are disaffected mercenaries or soldiers from elsewhere who have been recruited by the consortium to keep order in their company mill towns. Others have risen through the ranks of the company, beginning as simple roughnecks on the logging crews but showing an aptitude for pushing others around and informing on those they see as slackers to the company overseers.

  Lumber Consortium enforcers serve a dual role as overseers for the company that manage works crews while nominally offering skilled protection from any threats the forest might offer. In reality, enforcers' responsibilities within the company vary wildly based on the talent of the individuals and the whims of their overseers. Though not necessarily well schooled, some enforcers are selected for their cunning, intuition, and ability to motivate underlings by finding methods that keep people in line.

  Since the Lumber Consortium considers itself the de facto authority in the lands it claims, these enforcers often take on the role of a police force. While a few do their best to maintain order and pursue justice, others spend more time spying on the populace and arresting people for “interfering with company business.” Those living in areas controlled by the consortium are often subjected to threats, intimidation, and even beatings. Occasionally, the enforcers' strong-arm tactics do elicit useful information about people working outside the company's control, but for many enforcers the bullying is its own reward, and a means to maintain a climate of fear and control.
