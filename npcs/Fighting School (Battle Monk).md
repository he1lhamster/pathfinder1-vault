npc_boon: A battle monk can assist the PCs in a single fight (or send several initiates)
  if it serves the interest of her academy or her master. A battle monk could also
  introduce the PCs to the master of her academy or to a diplomat, merchant, or other
  NPC from the land where her martial art originated.
desc_long: |-
  Battle monks are the instructors in fighting schools and monasteries, teaching the arts of agility and swift perfection to their students. They are also the honor guard for their masters, the messengers and emissaries of the school and its methods.

  Battle monks make excellent thief-takers and midlevel bounty hunters, catching and disabling their quarry and bring them back for questioning. A battle monk can also serve as an unarmed, but still dangerous and effective, bodyguard.

  A battle monk often has a trio of initiates with her (CR 6), or two battle monks might accompany a holy warrior affiliated with the school (CR 8).
