desc_long: |-
  Pilgrims are religious mendicants who roam the long roads visiting shrines, temples, and other places sacred to their faith. They are ordinary folk, little trained in formal theology but with a passion for spreading their religion through their travels, being of service to all that they meet, and healing the hurts of a sad and lonely world.

  Pilgrims can serve as lay priests, common healers, or village wise women in settlements too small for a formal temple or full cleric. A pilgrim might also be found on a battlefield, pressed into service to make up for an army's lack of divine healers.

  Replacing one of the pilgrim's commoner levels with a level of adept creates a healer that has at least limited access to healing magic. Hit Dice, hit points, base attacks bonus, and skills don't change, but the pilgrim's Will save increases to +6.

  A pilgrim often works alone, but two or three might staff a remote clinic (CR 5 or 6). Pilgrims can also be found in groups of four, often accompanied by four caravan guards or eight acolytes (CR 8). A single pilgrim may be served by a guard, caravan guard, or pair of acolytes (CR 4). A pilgrim in turn might serve under a shaman (CR 6), while an evil pilgrim may work with a torturer, helping to keep prisoners alive (CR 6).
