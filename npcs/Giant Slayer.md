tactics:
  During Combat: The barbarian switches from a one-handed to a two-handed grip on
    his axe as the situation demands. He uses his shield against multiple foes but
    keeps his bow in hand if in melee against a lone enemy. He uses his rolling dodge
    before exposing himself to missiles, especially giant-hurled boulders, and assumes
    his guarded stance in melee. He charges with Spring Attack to get close to his
    enemies, following it up with full attacks.
