tactics:
  Before Combat: The monk prefers to challenge foes openly. He spends a point from
    his ki pool to increase his speed.
  During Combat: The monk uses Great Cleave and Lunge in tandem, normally spending
    a point from his ki pool to offset the Armor Class penalty of these two feats.
    The monk makes unarmed strikes, attempting to stun or stagger with Stunning Fist
    and then use Improved Bull Rush to push the enemy away. If overwhelmed, the monk
    drinks a potion of mirror image to confuse attackers, uses Spring Attack or Great
    Cleave to attack multiple opponents as a standard action, then moves away quickly.
    The monk always leaves 2 points in his ki pool so he can use abundant step if
    he's severely threatened.
