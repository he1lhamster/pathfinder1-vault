  The members of Rahadoum's elite Pure Legion are among the most vigilant and skilled police force in the Inner Sea region, dedicated to the sole purpose of keeping that nation free of the influence of gods and those who worship them. In the wake of the Oath Wars, which tore northern Garund apart as the churches of Nethys, Norgorber, and Sarenrae fought for control of the region, the nation of Rahadoum was founded upon the belief that all religions were a pox upon the world and that the worship of any divine force could bring about nothing but ill fortune. To stay true to this belief, for the last 21 centuries the Pure Legionnaires have worked ceaselessly to keep priests, lay worshipers, and religious paraphernalia out of their land.

  Based in Azir, the birthplace of the Laws of Man and now known as Port Godless, the Pure Legion inspects all vessels coming into Rahadoum to ensure they contain no religious paraphernalia and convey no would-be proselytizers. Any religious iconography found within the nation is confiscated and destroyed, and those who profess the veneration of any deity are forbidden entry into the land; such residents are deported or worse, depending on the seriousness of their crime. Legionnaires are trained to see through deception, from mundane lies about a visitor's faith to illusions and magical misdirections, and often utilize trusted arcane spellcasters to verify that magical items brought into Rahadoum pose no divine threat to their strictly atheist society.

  Pure Legionnaires fill a variety of roles, from serving as ship inspectors and camel-riding desert caravan guards to city law enforcement and cult-hunters who infiltrate secret sects of illicit deity worshipers within the Rahadoumi population. Smugglers who are tempted to make a steep profit by transporting religious items into the nation often discover that the cost of challenging the Pure Legion is more than they're willing to pay, and much of the Pure Legion's work involves maintaining enough of a reputation to deter hidden priests and closet faithful from publicly violating their nation's most important law. While Pure Legionnaires aren't as bloodthirsty as other nations may portray them, all are zealously devoted to the cause.
