    Wisdom bonus on Perception and Sense Motive checks. Additionally, he gains a bonus
    equal to 1/2 his shieldmarshal level on Perception checks opposed by another creature's
    Disguise or Sleight of Hand checks.
  Gunmarshal (Ex): The shieldmarshal adds 1/2 his shieldmarshal level to his gunslinger
    level for the purpose of gaining deeds. Within the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, the
    shieldmarshal gains a bonus on all Charisma-based skill checks equal to 1/2 his
    shieldmarshal level if he openly displays his shieldmarshal's badge.
  Labyrinthine Cunning (Ex): The shieldmarshal never becomes lost in urban terrain,
    and he never takes penalties to movement for poor visibility in urban terrain,
    even while temporarily blinded. A shieldmarshal can open or close doors as a swift
    action instead of a move action.
  Legal Judgment (Ex): The shieldmarshal can pronounce legal judgment upon his foes
    as a swift action, providing a bonus or ability based on the type of judgment
    made. This functions as an inquisitor's judgment class feature and allows the
    shieldmarshal to use the legal judgment abilities on page 63.
desc_long: Shieldmarshals uphold the law in the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar. Chief among
  their duties is preserving the secrets behind Alkenstar's most advanced weapons.
  Their badges, an emblem of crossed rif les, grant them the authority to enter nearly
  any building in Alkenstar in the course of their investigations.
