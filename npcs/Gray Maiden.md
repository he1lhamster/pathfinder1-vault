  When Queen Ileosa Arabasti first came to power in the Varisian city of Korvosa, she transformed her personal guard into an order of all-female knights who served as her elite soldiers. Known as Gray Maidens both for its members' flawless suits of polished steel full-plate armor and for their generally stern and imposing dispositions, this order was staunchly loyal to the queen throughout her reign and carried out her direct orders.

  Ileosa maintained her control over these skilled warriors through a complex regimen of extreme mental and physical torture, including the brutal and permanent scarring of the knights' faces to ensure that none of the Gray Maidens could rival the queen's beauty. The result warped many of the knights' views of the world, and left many Gray Maidens desensitized to suffering and morally ambivalent toward commands to perform evil tasks in their commander's name.

  When Ileosa fell from power, the Gray Maidens were disbanded. While many removed their masks and now do all they can to pursue a normal life, the most fanatical and psychologically scarred spread throughout Varisia, into some parts of Cheliax, and to more distant lands. Without a leader but knowing little else beyond service and violence, these remaining Gray Maidens seek new names and purposes in a world they no longer feel connected to. In Korvosa itself, Sabina Merrin (LN female human fighter 14)-the order's founder and Queen Ileosa's former consort-works to right the wrongs committed by the Gray Maidens, though many in the city are still understandably wary of her intentions. Elsewhere in Varisia, however, the former Gray Maiden Oriana (CN female human fighter 8) leads a devout group of fellow dishonored maidens who are unrepentant of their actions under Ileosa. Their whereabouts are currently unknown, but Oriana and those faithful to her are believed to be working toward retaking Korvosa in Queen Ileosa's honor, though what means they plan to use remain as shrouded as their scar-marked faces.
