  Sodden scavenger is a term used by many to refer to the destitute and storm-beaten survivors who make the Sodden Lands their homes. The hardy people that eke out their lives in the Sodden Lands group together for survival. Extended families often provide the spine of these communities. Many refer to the collections of sodden scavengers as gangs, which in many ways they are. Though the scavengers see their survival as a triumph, they live in an anarchic land where the laws of one community may not be those of another. These autocratic communities range in population from barely two dozen into the hundreds.

  The gangs residing in the reclaimed cities of windblasted Jula, the tangle of towers remaining of Hyrantam, and sunken Oagon also count among those whom foreigners call the sodden scavengers. The strongest of these gangs is the ironically named Knights of Abendego, whose reach for territory has been expanding in recent years. Other gangs such as the reptile-wrangling Crocodile Raiders, the metal-salvaging Machine Union, the diseased and drug-dealing Possum Gang, the mystical cult known as Three Prong, and the skygazing descendants of the Lirgeni known as the An-Ydak-as well as dozens of others-all stake their claims on the apocalyptic lands of the Abendego Gulf.

  In addition to battling with each other, sodden scavengers frequently compete for resources and territory among themselves-that is, when they're not too busy fighting off the tribes of boggards and lizardfolk who also dwell in the region. The Koboto tribes in the south, said to be the descendants of the lost nation of Yamasa, pose a further threat to the holdings of the sodden scavengers. In the far southern coast of the Sodden Lands, a pirate town known as Greenblood hosts an annual bloodsport event called Green Blood on a Black Rock that brings pirates from the Shackles and beyond to the Sodden Lands, leaving the sodden scavengers with yet more foes in the harsh and daunting region.
