  A journeyman carpenter is skilled with a hammer, but tries to avoid violence except to defend himself and his family. Tools can be rebuilt or replaced, and he will not waste his life protecting mere objects.

  The above stat block can be used for any journeyman whose trade requires skill and strength, such as a blacksmith, stonemason, or teamster. The stat block can also be used for older warriors in orc or hobgoblin tribes who are not as vigorous but are still able to fight.
