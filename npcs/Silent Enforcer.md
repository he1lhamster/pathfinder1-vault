  Based in the Nidalese city of Nisroch, the Silent Enforcers maintain brutal order in the name of Zon-Kuthon and the city's Silent Shroud, the official security force that they're members of. Rather than recruiting from among Nisroch's populace, the enforcers of the Silent Shroud kidnap children from the city's lowest classes, whom they mold to fit their ideals. These children must endure a terrifying regimen of indoctrination and torture, and are rendered mute by the application of a hot poker to the throat. Those who survive emerge nameless and almost devoid of identity, their bodies hardened into living weapons that need neither armor with which to protect themselves nor implements with which to kill. Indoctrinated only to listen and react, to obey and not to think, a fully trained Silent Enforcer is a merciless and imposing agent of the Shrouded One-the mysterious leader of the Silent Shroud, and the only member to retain the ability to speak. The Shrouded One's identity is known only to Nisroch's top city officials, but even she is said to remain nameless, like her enforcers, identifying herself only with a series of hand gestures despite her ability to speak her own name should she wish to do so.

  Silent Enforcers primarily exercise authority over the peasants of Nisroch, but have jurisdiction over any criminal act committed in their sight. For the most part, the punishment for a crime the monks witness is up to each Silent Enforcer's own discretion, and they more often err on the side of the harsh and lethal variety. Should a Silent Enforcer catch a more notable citizen or an inf luential foreigner committing a crime, the perpetrator is expected to be apprehended rather than killed; it is acceptable for such criminals to turn up battered, so long as they're taken alive. Completely devoid of redeeming emotion, Silent Enforcers show mercy not to spare lives, but rather to subject their prisoners to the fearsome justice of Nidal. Most victims prefer a clean death in battle to the unimaginably sadistic tortures that would be exacted upon them should they be taken prisoner by an agent of the Silent Shroud.

  Typically, Silent Enforcers work in pairs or other multiples of two. Partners are assigned randomly each dawn, lest undue attachments form between agents that might compromise their duties. Should a Silent Enforcer be defeated, the lives of any peasants who bear witness to or spread tales of such an embarrassment are forfeit. Even nobles fear to speak of such occurrences, for the protections normally provided for those of their stature are ignored when the flawless reputation and intimidating legend of the Silent Shroud is at stake. Silent Enforcers treat the elimination of those attempting to escape their authority as a paramount duty, though their pursuit rarely extends beyond Nisroch's walls.

Based in the Nidalese city of Nisroch, the Silent Enforcers maintain brutal order in the name of Zon-Kuthon and the city’s Silent Shroud, the official security force that they’re members of.
