    oil of magic vestment, then drinks his potions of barkskin, heroism, and bear's
    endurance and activates his boots of flying.

    hits, then switches to another. He usually opts to inflict stun and bleed, then
    blind and exhaust. He goes after good outsiders, paladins, and clerics of good-aligned
    deities first.
