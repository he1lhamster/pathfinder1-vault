  Cypher Magic: The cyphermage casts spells from scrolls as 1 caster level higher
    than the scroll's caster level, even scrolls she created (all listed scrolls).
    Additionally, she gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks to activate a scroll
    that has a higher caster level than her own.
desc_long: |-
  The cyphermages of the pirate town of Riddleport are students of ancient Thassilonian history and runic lore. Members of the mysterious Order of Cyphers, they pursue lost knowledge and keep their discoveries secret from outsiders-and in their overwhelming ambition to be the first to solve great mysteries, keep secrets even from the other members of their enigmatic order.

  Because all cyphermages are especially attuned to runes- whether the runes are newly scribed or ancient carvings in Thassilonian ruins like Riddleport's Cyphergate- they have unusual skill at using written magic such as scrolls, and can draw extra power from these items.
