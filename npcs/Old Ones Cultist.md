  Stoic: 'The cultist gains a +1 bonus on all saving throws against fear effects.

    effects from that source for 24 hours. (See page 289 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting:

  whose existence is an affront to reality itself. While the practices of any one
  of these cults in particular is likely isolated to certain regions of Golarion,
  those who venerate the Old Cults can be found hidden away in virtually any land,
  making their infiltration of society that much more insidious.
