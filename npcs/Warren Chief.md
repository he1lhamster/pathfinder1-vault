  - stunning fist (17/day, DC 22)
tactics:
  Before Combat: The monk drinks his potions of barkskin and protection from energy
    (fire) if he has had time to study his foes' weaknesses. When fighting in cramped
    or narrow areas, he instead drinks his potion of invisibility and coats an area
    of the floor with his salve of slipperiness. He then waits for foes to enter the
    greased area before attacking.
  During Combat: The monk uses his kama in conjunction with Spring Attack and Improved
    Trip to knock foes prone, potentially using the kama's ki focus special ability
    to channel his Stunning Fist. If he has successfully tripped foes with his salve
    of slipperiness, he activates his slippers of spider climbing so he doesn't have
    to cross the slippery floor, and uses flurry of blows with his shuriken. If outnumbered,
    he uses his elemental gem and flanks with the earth elemental.
  Base Statistics: Without barkskin and protection from energy, the monk's statistics
    are Immune disease, poison; AC 28, touch 24, flat-footed 25.
