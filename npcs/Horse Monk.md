tactics:
  Before Combat: The monk prefers to ambush foes, and uses his diamond body ability
    to poison either his spear or at least two javelins without risk to himself.
  During Combat: The monk prefers to fight from horseback, and uses Ride-By Attack
    and Lunge to hit foes so he faces little risk of retaliation. He often uses Stunning
    Fist on the first pass, and if successful follows with a Spirited Charge. Against
    other mounted foes, he uses Improved Trip to unhorse his opponents if possible.
