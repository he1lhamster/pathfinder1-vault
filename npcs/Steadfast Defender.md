tactics:
  Before Combat: The monk drinks his potions of mage armor and bear's endurance and
    tries to find a choke point where he can stand fast and hold off his enemies.
  During Combat: If he can control an opening such as a doorway, the monk does his
    best not to move or let others past. He uses Vital Strike whenever he cannot use
    flurry of blows. He uses Improved Bull Rush on any opponent that has failed its
    saving throw versus Scorpion Style, trying to remove it from direct combat. He
    trips those adjacent to him so he can make attacks of opportunity when they stand
    up from prone. Against a single opponent, the steadfast defender uses his ki pool
    to add extra attacks to his flurry of blows; against multiple opponents he uses
    it to improve his Armor Class.
  Base Statistics: When not under the effects of bear's endurance and mage armor,
    the monk's statistics are AC 19, touch 18, flat-footed 18; hp 75; Fort +10; Con
    16.
