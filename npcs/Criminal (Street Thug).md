desc_long: |-
  Street thugs are the alleybashers and bullyboys of the streets. They are the crude muscle employed by other criminals to keep rivals at bay and shake down hapless shopkeeps and business owners. Innocent townsfolk live in fear of a street thug slipping out of the shadows to administer a brutal beating.

  In more lawless cities, street thugs can serve as corrupt guardsmen or as a vigilante militia. Street thugs can also be used as bouncers in a tavern or casino. Replacing Two-Weapon Fighting with Intimidating Prowess makes a street thug a better extortionist. Outside of cities and towns, street thugs can also be used as bandits or brigands, or as low-level guards for a merchant caravan.

  A single street thug can be a prostitute's pimp (CR 3) or the intimidating partner of a pickpocket (CR 2). A pair of street thugs might operate with a slaver (CR 5) or torturer (CR 6), or they might work as bodyguards for a dealer acting as a minor crimelord (CR 5). Six street thugs might form a riot-busting brute squad (CR 6).
