tactics:
  Before Combat: The barbarian uses his warhorse for transportation, but if expecting
    combat, he retrieves an animal from his bag of tricks and rides it instead.
  During Combat: The barbarian charges whenever possible, whether mounted or on foot,
    using Mounted Combat and his +1 arrow catching buckler to divert attacks made
    against his mount. If his mount is slain, he draws a replacement from his bag
    of tricks and makes a fast mount. He uses guarded stance and rolling dodge as
    needed, often using them or renewed vigor after a ride-by charge while circling
    around into position for another charge.
  Base Statistics: When not raging, the barbarian's statistics are AC 19, touch 11,
