  Aldori Dueling Mastery: 'The Aldori swordlord gains a +2 bonus on Initiative checks
    whenever she starts combat with an Aldori dueling sword in her hand. As long as
    she wields only a single Aldori dueling sword in one hand, she gains a +2 shield
    bonus to AC; if she wields the sword in two hands, this bonus decreases to +1.
    (See page 284 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide.)'
  Defensive Parry (Ex): When the Aldori swordlord makes a full attack with an Aldori
    dueling sword, she gains a +1 bonus to AC against melee attacks until the beginning
    of her next turn.
  Deft Strike (Ex): The Aldori swordlord can add her Dexterity bonus on damage rolls
    made with an Aldori dueling sword instead of using her Strength bonus. This bonus
    on damage applies whether she is wielding an Aldori dueling sword one-handed or
    two-handed, though she does not apply 1-1/2 times her Dexterity bonus on damage
    rolls while fighting two-handed. She cannot use this ability if she is wielding
    a shield or an off-hand weapon, including armor spikes, unarmed strikes, or natural
    weapons.
  Disarming Strike (Ex): When the Aldori swordlord successfully disarms an opponent
    using an Aldori dueling sword, she also deals normal damage to the target, but
    without the normal Strength (or Dexterity) bonus to damage.
desc_long: Proud and stern, Aldori swordlords represent the pinnacle of Brevoy's sword-dueling
  culture. Swordlords dedicate their lives to mastering a single blade and using it
  to defeat any with the courage to openly oppose them. Their pride and determination
  to constantly challenge themselves makes them ever-eager to prove the superiority
  of their fighting style, which often sets them at odds with others.
