    The Hellknight has access to two disciplines.

    Fearsomeness: Twice per day, the Hellknight can use the Intimidate skill to cause a creature within 10 feet to become frightened instead of shaken.

    Pentamic Faith: The Hellknight gains all granted powers of the Law domain (but not domain spells), treating his Hellknight level as his cleric level.
  Force of Will (Ex): The Hellknight gains a +2 bonus on Will saves against spells
    with the charm descriptor and a +4 bonus against spells with the fear descriptor.
  Hellknight Armor (Ex): The Hellknight wears a special type of masterwork full plate
    called Hellknight plate armor. While wearing this armor, he reduces the armor
    check penalty by 2, increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by 2, and moves
    at full speed.
  Smite Chaos (Su): This functions as the paladin's smite evil ability, but against
    chaotic-aligned creatures. This ability is twice as effective against outsiders
    with the chaotic subtype, chaotic-aligned aberrations, and fey.
desc_long: Hellknights are living embodiments of unyielding law, striving to impose
  order on everyone and believing that justice can only be achieved through the suppression
  of mortals' chaotic tendencies. They are feared wherever they go by criminals and
  law-abiding citizens alike.
