desc_long: Magnimar has few laws for a city its size, but it still employs a sizable
  force of guards, centralized within the towering Arvensoar. Guards walk the streets
  regularly, policing the various quarters and maintaining peace throughout the city,
  though the wealthier districts see noticeably more protection than areas such as
  the Shadow. Magnimar's city guards are trained to detain criminals and keep the
  peace without needless violence, using nonlethal force in all but the most extreme
  cases.
