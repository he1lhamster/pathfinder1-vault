### Special Abilities

**Cold Flesh (Ex)** A winter _witch_ gains _endure elements_ as a constant, spell-like ability, but only against cold temperatures. At 4th level, she gains cold _resistance_ 5, making her comfortable in near-freezing temperatures. This replaces the _witch_’s 4th-level hex.

**_Freeze_ and Thaw (Su)** At 2nd level, a winter _witch_ can _freeze_ water or melt ice and snow with a touch. As a standard action, a winter _witch_ can melt an adjacent 5-foot cube of ice or 10-foot cube of snow. Melting snow produces a volume of water equal to 10% the snow’s volume. Alternatively, a winter _witch_ can _freeze_ 5 cubic feet of water into solid ice. This freezing takes place gradually over 1 round, making it almost impossible to trap a creature unless it’s _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_. This ability cannot affect water within a creature. One cubic foot of ice contains roughly 8 gallons of water and weighs about 60 pounds. This ability works on fresh water and saltwater, but has no affect on water creatures; on liquids (frozen or otherwise) other than water; or on magical water, ice, or snow. A winter _witch_ can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her class level.

**Hyperboreal Patronage** A winter _witch_’s patron reveals an icy aspect. A winter _witch_ adds the following spells to her spell list at the following class levels, but does not automatically learn them: 3rd—_wall of ice_, 5th—_[[spells/Icy Prison|icy prison]]_, 7th—_[[spells/Freezing Sphere|freezing sphere]]_.

**Ice Magic **When a winter _witch_ casts a spell with the cold descriptor, the save DC of the spell increases by 1. A winter _witch_ cannot learn or cast spells with the fire descriptor.
**Sculpt Ice and Snow (Sp) **At 4th level, a winter _witch_ can sculpt ice and snow into any shape that suits her purpose (as _[[spells/Stone Shape|stone shape]]_, except that it works with ice). This ability also works on snow, doubling the volume affected. At 7th level, this ability functions on ice or snow like the _[[spells/Fabricate|fabricate]]_ spell, increasing the volume manipulated and allowing a higher degree of craftsmanship. The winter _witch_ must succeed at appropriate Craft checks to form complex items or ones with fine detail. Items created by the _fabricate_ version of this ability solidify into ultra-hard ice (hardness 5, 10 hit points per inch of thickness) that resists normal melting but takes double damage from fire. The ice remains in this ultra-hard state for 1 hour per class level before returning to normal ice. A winter _witch_ can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her class level.

**Unnatural Cold (Su)** At 3rd level, whenever a winter _witch_’s spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability deals cold damage, treat affected creatures as having half their normal cold _resistance_ when determining damage dealt.

**Winter Witchcraft** Levels of the winter _witch_ prestige class stack with _witch_ levels for determining when the winter _witch_ learns new hexes, the effect of her hexes and other _witch_ class abilities (including archetype abilities), the abilities of her _witch_’s familiar, and the level at which she can select major hexes or grand hexes.

Nearly all of the White Witches ruling Irrisen are winter witches. This one represents a Cold Sister, a member of an organization devoted to hunting down anyone disloyal to the throne of Irrisen. Those the Cold Sisters find, they torture into compliance and devotion, or execute for their crimes against the queen.
