  Generals may command from a rearward vantage point, but when needed, may dive into

  be used as arena champions, masters of fighting schools, or elite warriors trained
  to fight with or against spellcasters. A general is usually accompanied by a knight
  adjutant, with a lance of four cavalry as bodyguards and messengers (CR 12).
