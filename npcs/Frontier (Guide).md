desc_long: |-
  Guides are trailblazers and pathfinders, master trackers and experts at finding their way through the wilderness. They are outriders and scouts par excellence, but they leave the heavy fighting to others, preferring to snipe from long range while keeping well out of harm's way.

  Guides might also be used as highly-skilled longrange messengers, or perhaps members of a specially trained royal courier corps. Guides might also serve as elite dragoons or mounted infantry in a powerful army.

  A single guide may be encountered escorting two pilgrims (CR 8) or a pair of traveling merchants and their sellsword bodyguard (CR 10), or she might lead an entire caravan, with eight caravan guards and eight vagabonds (CR 10). A guide might also partner with a monster hunter or minstrel (CR 8) or two knights hunting evil in the wilderness (CR 9). A wise guide frequently works with a pair of trappers who are intimately familiar with an area (CR 8).
