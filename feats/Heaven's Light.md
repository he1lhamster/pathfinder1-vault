# Heaven's Light (Conduit)

You are a luminous beacon in the _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_, an _[[items/Shield/Icon of Order|icon of order]]_ and kindness through which the light of Heaven itself can shine, even in the most dreadful of realms.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (planes) 1 rank.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can emit an aura of bright light centered on a glowing halo above or behind your head. The illumination provided is equal in intensity to that of a _[[items/Mundane/Torch|torch]]_. If you have at least 5 ranks in Knowledge (planes) the illumination is equivalent to that created by a _[[spells/Daylight|daylight]]_ spell. If you have at least 15 ranks in Knowledge (planes), the light becomes further infused with Heavenly power, and each evil creature within 30 feet of you must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) or become _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ by the light for as long as it remains in range plus 1 additional round after leaving the area. You can use this feat's benefit for a number of rounds per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These rounds need not be consecutive.
