# Feral Heart (Story)

In your chest beasts the heart of a wild beast.

**Prerequisites:** You must have reverted to savage behavior through a traumatic event or extended period in the wilderness, or have the Raised by Beasts background.

**Benefit:** Whenever you receive a morale bonus on Strength or attack rolls (such as from _[[spells/Heroism|heroism]]_ or the _[[classes/Barbarian|barbarian]]_ _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ class feature), you receive a +2 bonus on Dexterity- and Strength-based ability and skill checks and a +1 bonus on Reflex saves until the morale bonus effect ends.

**Goal:** Woo and then marry or otherwise enter into a committed relationship with a person from a civilized culture. This relationship must be forged in love, not bought or coerced.

**Completion Benefit:** Delay the penalties for the _[[conditions/Exhausted|exhausted]]_, _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_, _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_, and _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ conditions for 1 round after first receiving them. If you already have the condition in question and it is applied again, this feat provides no benefit. Despite ignoring the penalties you do still have the condition. For example, if you become _shaken_ again while benefiting from this feat, you become _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_ as normal.
