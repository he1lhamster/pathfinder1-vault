# Emissary's Emboldening (Familiar)

Your familiar lends you divine courage.

**Prerequisites:** Must have a familiar with the emissary archetype (see page 10).

**Benefit:** As long as your familiar is adjacent to you, you gain a +1 morale bonus against _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effects. This bonus increases by 1 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter (to a maximum of +5 at 16th level). At 20th level, you become immune to _fear_ effects as long as your familiar is adjacent to you.
