# Consecrate Spell (Metamagic)

You infuse spells with heavenly power, drastically increasing their effectiveness against would-be heralds of evil.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Aasimar|Aasimar]]_, able to prepare or cast _[[spells/Consecrate|consecrate]]_.

**Benefit:** A consecrated spell is treated as a maximized spell against evil creatures and creatures with the evil subtype. Against all other creatures, this feat does not modify the spell in any way (for example, a consecrated _[[spells/Fireball|fireball]]_ acts as a normal _fireball_ against neutral or good creatures). This feat does not stack with _[[feats/Maximize Spell|Maximize Spell]]_. A consecrated spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.
