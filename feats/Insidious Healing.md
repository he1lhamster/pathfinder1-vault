# Insidious Healing

Your healing spells give you an advantage when you choose to affect those targets with other spells.

**Benefit:** Any creature that chooses not to attempt a saving throw against any healing spell you cast takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against other targeted spells you cast for 24 hours.
