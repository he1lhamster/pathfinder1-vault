# Startoss Style (Combat, Style)

Your thrown weapons become more _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Point-Blank Shot|Point-Blank Shot]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ with the chosen weapon.

**Benefit:** Choose one weapon from the thrown _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_ weapon group. While using this style and the chosen weapon, you gain a bonus on damage rolls made with the weapon equal to 2 + 2 per style feat you possess that lists _[[feats/Startoss Style|Startoss Style]]_ as a prerequisite (maximum +6 damage). You cannot use this ability if you are carrying a weapon or a _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ in your off hand (except for a _[[items/Armor/Buckler|buckler]]_).

**Special:** In addition to the chosen weapon, a character with this feat and the weapon _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ (thrown) class feature can use _Startoss Style_ with any thrown weapons that she wields in one hand.
