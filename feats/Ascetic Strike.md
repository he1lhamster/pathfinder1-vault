# Ascetic Strike (Combat)

Your weapon strikes deal more damage than usual.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Ascetic Form|Ascetic Form]]_; _[[feats/Ascetic Style|Ascetic Style]]_; _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ with the chosen weapon; base attack bonus +7 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 7th.

**Benefit:** You can use the unarmed strike damage of a _monk_ 4 levels lower than your character level (minimum 1st) instead of the base damage for the chosen weapon. _[[feats/Ascetic Strike|Ascetic Strike]]_ functions in all other ways as the _[[classes/Brawler|brawler]]_'s close weapon masteryACG class feature. In addition, you ignore the still mind class feature prerequisite for the Monastic LegacyUC feat.
