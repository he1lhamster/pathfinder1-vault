# Group Shared Spells (Teamwork)

Your allies can cast spells through each other's familiars.

**Prerequisites:** Must have a familiar with the _[[feats/Share Spells|share spells]]_ ability.

**Benefit:** You and any allies with this feat can cast spells with a target of "you" on each other's familiars as touch spells. Both the target familiar and that familiar's master must be willing for the spell to take effect. You can cast spells on each other's familiars even if the spells would not normally affect creatures of the targeted familiar's type.
