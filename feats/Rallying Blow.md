# Rallying Blow

When you _[[feats/Strike True|strike true]]_ in battle, you wash away allies' _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Aura of courage.

**Benefit:** When you confirm a critical hit against an enemy, any _fear_ effect affecting allies within 30 feet is reduced by one step. _[[conditions/Panicked|Panicked]]_ becomes _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_, _frightened_ becomes _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_, and _shaken_ is removed. In addition, any ally suffering other effects from a failed save against a _fear_ effect, such as the _[[universal monster rules/Paralysis|paralysis]]_ from a _[[monsters/Mummy|mummy]]_'s despair aura, receives a new save against the effect at the original DC.
