# Planar Preservationist

You know how to _[[spells/Preserve|preserve]]_ and reconstitute extraplanar monsters as well as normal animals.

**Prerequisites:** Preservationist _[[classes/Alchemist|alchemist]]_ archetype.

**Benefit:** For every _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ nature's ally extract you know, you learn the equivalent _summon_ monster spell as an extract. If you later learn other _summon_ nature's ally extracts, you automatically learn the equivalent _summon_ monster spell as an extract.
