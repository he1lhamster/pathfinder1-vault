# Beast Rider

You gain the service of a _[[feats/Monstrous Companion|monstrous companion]]_ or _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Animal companion or _mount_ class feature, character level 7th, half-orc or _[[monsters/Orc|orc]]_.

**Benefit:** Select one of the following creature types: _[[monsters/Elephant|elephant]]_, pteranodon, _[[monsters/Rhinoceros|rhinoceros]]_, stegosaurus, or triceratops. Add this creature type to your list of possible animal companions or mounts. When summoning a creature of the selected type to serve as a _mount_ or companion, treat your effective _[[classes/Druid|druid]]_ level as if it were two levels higher (to a maximum of your character level). If the creature is large enough for you to ride, it gains the combat _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ general purpose (see Handle Animal) at no cost.
