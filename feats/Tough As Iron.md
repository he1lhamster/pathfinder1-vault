# Tough As Iron

Effects that grant natural armor work even better for you.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Toughness|Toughness]]_, _[[monsters/Duergar|duergar]]_.

**Benefit:** When you gain an enhancement bonus to your natural armor, that bonus increases by 2. This has no effect if your natural armor bonus is +0 or you do not have an enhancement bonus increasing your natural armor bonus.
