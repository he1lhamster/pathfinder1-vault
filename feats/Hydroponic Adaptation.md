# Hydroponic Adaptation

You can change your wings to instead be effective _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Gathlain|Gathlain]]_, racial fly speed.

**Benefit:** Once per day as a full-round action, you can lose your fly speed to gain a swim speed of 30 feet as you reconfigure your symbiotic vines to help you move _underwater_. This effect lasts for 1 hour, or until you end it as a full-round action.
