# Innate Flexibility

Your innate magic is flexible.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Duergar|Duergar]]_, two racial _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ usable once per day.

**Benefit:** You gain a number of additional uses of your once per day racial _spell-like abilities_ equal to the number of such abilities you have. You can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ these additional uses in any combination. Normal _duergar_ _spell-like abilities_ and those granted by _duergar_ racial traits both count for the purpose of this feat. For example, a normal _duergar_ has two once per day _spell-like abilities_ (_[[spells/Enlarge Person|enlarge person]]_ and _[[spells/Invisibility|invisibility]]_), so taking this feat would grant her two additional uses of her once per day _spell-like abilities_; each day she can use either two additional uses of _enlarge person_, two additional uses of _invisibility_, or one additional use of each.

**Special:** You can take this feat multiple times. Its effects stack.
