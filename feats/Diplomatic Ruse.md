# Diplomatic Ruse (Teamwork)

With practiced gestures, you buy enough time to prepare yourself for an inevitable battle.

**Prerequisites:** Diplomacy 3 ranks, human (Keleshite).

**Benefit:** Whenever you're adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you can perform a quick, seemingly courteous gesture when you make an initiative check. As part of the gesture, you can perform a single free action, such as dropping an item or entering _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_. This feat can be used only when combat breaks out after a conversation, such as from failed negotiations.
