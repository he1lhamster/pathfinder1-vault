# Monstrous Companion

You have formed a bond with a creature far more exotic than an animal.

**Prerequisites:** Handle Animal 7 ranks; class feature that functions as the _[[classes/Druid|druid]]_ animal companion ability (including animal companion, divine bond [mount], _[[classes/Hunter|hunter]]_'s bond [animal companion], nature's bond [animal companion], and the _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_ class feature) with an effective _druid_ level of 7.

**Benefit:** You can select a magical beast as a cohort in place of your animal companion class feature (for more information on monster cohorts see Bestiary 316). The following chart determines the effective cohort level for your _[[feats/Monstrous Companion|monstrous companion]]_ based on your effective _druid_ level.

<table><tbody><tr><th>Effective _Druid_ Level</th><th>Effective Cohort Level</th></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>12</td></tr></tbody></table>

If the magical beast's effective cohort level is lower than what is allowed by your effective _druid_ level, the cohort gains class levels equal to the difference. A cohort with 1 class level gains the link and _[[feats/Share Spells|share spells]]_ abilities of an animal companion. A cohort with 3 class levels gains the evasion animal companion ability. A cohort with 6 class levels gains the devotion animal companion ability. If the class feature you use as a prerequisite for this feat does not grant one of those abilities (such as a _[[classes/Cavalier|cavalier]]_'s _mount_, which does not gain _share spells_), your _[[feats/Monstrous Mount|monstrous mount]]_ also does not gain the ability. The magical beast does not gain any abilities not listed here. In addition to the magical beasts listed in the Bestial Cohorts sidebar, this feat can be used to gain an ahuizotlB3, araneaB2, _[[spells/Blink|blink]]_ dogB2, dragon horseB2, dragonneB3, giant _[[monsters/Eagle|eagle]]_, giant owlB3, giant vultureB3, _[[monsters/Griffon|griffon]]_, kirinB3, leucrottaB2, _[[monsters/Manticore|manticore]]_, _[[monsters/Pegasus|pegasus]]_, sea catB4, sheduB3, sleipnirB3, _[[monsters/Worg|worg]]_, or xanthosB4. The rules for using each of these creatures as a monster cohort are presented in the appendices of their respective Pathfinder RPG Bestiary volumes.

**Special:** This feat counts as the _[[feats/Leadership|Leadership]]_ feat for the purposes of prerequisites. A character cannot have both _Leadership_ and _Monstrous Companion_.
