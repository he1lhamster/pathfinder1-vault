# Shadow's Shroud (Conduit)

You can camouflage yourself in shadows and gloom.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (planes) 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** As a swift action, you can shroud yourself in shifting, camouflaging _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|shadow]]_. While shrouded in this fashion, you can attempt Stealth checks as though you had concealment, even in areas of normal or bright light. Creatures that can see normally in supernatural _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_ can still see you normally. You can use this feat's benefit for a number of rounds per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These rounds need not be consecutive.

**Special:** Unlike spells like _[[spells/Shadow Walk|shadow walk]]_, which require you to be on a plane that is coterminous with the _Shadow_ Plane, this feat functions even on planes that do not normally share a border with the _Shadow_ Plane. Like all conduit feats, the effects are suppressed when _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Planar|planar]]_ travel is forbidden.
