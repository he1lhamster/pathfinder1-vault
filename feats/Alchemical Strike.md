# Alchemical Strike (Combat)

By focusing all your attention into a single attack, you vastly increase the effectiveness of thrown alchemical items.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Throw Anything|Throw Anything]]_, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** You can throw a single alchemical item as a full-attack action, increasing the effectiveness of the alchemical agent thrown. When _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Throwing|throwing]]_ a single alchemical item as a full-attack action, you increase the DC of any effects associated with that alchemical item by 2. When your base attack bonus reaches +11 and every 5 points of bonus thereafter, increase the saving throw DC of the alchemical item by an additional 2. This feat does not apply to an _[[classes/Alchemist|alchemist]]_'s bombs.

**Special:** An _alchemist_ can take this feat in place of an _alchemist_ discovery. He does not need to meet its prerequisites. The _alchemist_ uses his class level, rather than the base attack bonus granted by the _alchemist_ class, to calculate his total base attack bonus for the purposes of determining the bonus granted by this feat.
