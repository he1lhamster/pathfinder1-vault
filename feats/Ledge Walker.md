# Ledge Walker

You negotiate tiny ledges like a mountain goat.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, dwarf, _[[npcs/Mountaineer|mountaineer]]_ or stability racial trait.

**Benefit:** You can move at full speed while using Acrobatics to balance on narrow surfaces, and you gain a +4 bonus on Climb checks to catch yourself or another creature while falling. You also gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against effects that would cause you to fall _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ (such as earthquakes). This bonus does not apply to your CMD against bull rush or _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ attacks.
