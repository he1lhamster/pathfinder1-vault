# Racial Heritage

The blood of a non-human ancestor flows in your veins.

**Prerequisites:** Human.

**Benefit:** Choose another humanoid race. You count as both human and that race for any effects related to race. For example, if you choose dwarf, you are considered both a human and a dwarf for the purpose of taking traits, feats, how spells and magic items affect you, and so on.
