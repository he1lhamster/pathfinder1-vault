# Last Rites (Conduit)

You offer a path to the Boneyard for the walking dead and restless spirits.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack against any haunt or against an undead creature with the _[[spells/Resurrection|resurrection]]_ _[[curses/Vulnerability|vulnerability]]_ weakness. This touch attack deals 3d6 points of positive energy damage to the undead creature or haunt (ignoring _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_ and hardness); a creature damaged this way is _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1 round. You must have detected the haunt with a successful skill check or identified the undead creature with a successful Knowledge (religion) check to use this ability. You can use this feat's benefit once per day, plus an additional time per day for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge (planes). In addition, the amount of damage you deal with this ability increases by 1d6 for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge (planes).
