# Gun Twirling (Grit)

You can spin and juggle a small firearm, making it difficult to predict where you will shoot.

**Prerequisites:** Amateur GunslingerUC feat or grit class feature, _[[feats/Dazzling Display|Dazzling Display]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_.

**Benefit:** You can spend 1 grit point to make a feint attempt using a one-handed firearm for which you have _Weapon Focus_ (instead of a melee weapon). The target of this feint must be within 30 feet of you and be able to see you. If you have the _[[feats/Quick Draw|Quick Draw]]_ feat, you can holster a onehanded firearm as a free action as long as you have at least 1 grit point.
