# Swap Trick (Trick)

You can adjust a _[[classes/Mesmerist|mesmerist]]_ trick that has already been implanted in a creature.

**Prerequisites:** _Mesmerist_ tricks class feature.

**Benefit:** Whenever you implant a _mesmerist_ trick in a target, you can designate that trick as a _[[feats/Swap Trick|swap trick]]_. The implanted _mesmerist_ trick functions as normal, except you can trigger the _swap trick_ as a standard action by touching the target. When the _swap trick_ is triggered in this manner, the target "loses" the _swap trick_ and instead becomes implanted with any one _mesmerist_ trick that you know in its place. Implanting a _mesmerist_ trick in a target in this manner doesn't count against your number of daily uses of the _mesmerist_ trick class feature.
