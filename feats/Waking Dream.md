# Waking Dream

You can manipulate the world of dreams, even in your physical form.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 17, _[[feats/Ephemeral Tread|Ephemeral Tread]]_*, Lucid DreamerOA, Knowledge (planes) 10 ranks.

**Benefit:** When in the Dimension of Dreams in your physical body, you gain an additional attempt at an impossible action per day, for a total of two attempts. However, as a result of your meddling with the fabric of the realm, when you travel to the Dimension of Dreams in your physical body, you must succeed at a DC 15 Charisma check or arrive at a disadvantage.
