# Animal Ally

Your respect for nature is so great that you can form a deep and lasting friendship with an animal.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Nature Soul|Nature Soul]]_, character level 4th, must not have an animal companion or _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_ that advances as an animal companion.

**Benefit:** You gain an animal companion as if you were a _[[classes/Druid|druid]]_ of your character level -3 from the following list: _[[monsters/Badger|badger]]_, bird, camel, cat (small), dire rat, _[[monsters/Dog|dog]]_, _[[monsters/Horse, Pony|horse, pony]]_, snake (viper), or _[[monsters/Wolf|wolf]]_. If you later gain an animal companion through another source (such as the Animal domain, divine bond, _[[classes/Hunter|hunter]]_'s bond, _mount_, or nature bond class features), the effective _druid_ level granted by this feat stacks with that granted by other sources.
