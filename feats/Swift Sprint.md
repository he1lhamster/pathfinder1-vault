# Swift Sprint (Combat)

You balance your armor expertly, allowing you to run and sprint without impediment.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, Dex 13, _[[feats/Swift Iron Style|Swift Iron Style]]_, _[[feats/Swift Refuge|Swift Refuge]]_, proficiency with _[[classes/Medium|medium]]_ armor.

**Benefit:** When you're charging, running, or taking no action in your turn other than movement, your armor does not reduce your movement.
