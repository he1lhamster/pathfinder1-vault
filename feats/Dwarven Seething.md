# Dwarven Seething (Combat)

Your hatred drives every swing of your weapon.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Dwarven Hatred Style|Dwarven Hatred Style]]_, base attack bonus +5, defensive _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ and hatred racial traits, _[[classes/Medium|Medium]]_ size.

**Benefit:** While using _Dwarven Hatred Style_, when an opponent hits you with an attack (including a spell that requires an attack roll), you can apply your defensive _training_ or your hatred racial trait bonus (your choice) against that target, regardless of the opponent's type or subtype, as an immediate action. This ability lasts until the opponent dies, the combat ends, you change styles, or you designate a different opponent with this ability, whichever occurs first.
