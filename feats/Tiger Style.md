# Tiger Style (Combat, Style)

Your unarmed fighting style emulates the strength and _[[universal monster rules/Ferocity|ferocity]]_ of a _[[monsters/Tiger|tiger]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +3 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 3rd.

**Benefit:** While using this style, you gain a +2 bonus to your CMD against bull rush, overrun, and _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ maneuvers. You can also deal slashing damage with your unarmed strikes. Whenever you score a critical hit with your slashing unarmed strike, your opponent also takes 1d4 points of _[[universal monster rules/Bleed|bleed]]_ damage at the start of his next two turns.

**Normal:** Unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning damage.
