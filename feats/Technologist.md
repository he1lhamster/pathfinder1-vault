# Technologist

You are familiar with the basic mechanics of technology.

**Benefit:** You are considered to be trained in any skill used against a technology-based subject. If the skill in question requires _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ to use even against non-technological subjects, you must still have ranks in that skill in order to gain the benefit of _[[feats/Technologist|Technologist]]_.

**Normal:** You treat all skill checks made against technology as if they were untrained skill checks. This may mean that you cannot attempt certain skill checks, even if you possess ranks in the skill in question.
