# Experienced Ghost Hunter

You've fought enough specters that doing so has become second nature.

**Prerequisites:** Character level 7th, _[[monsters/Duskwalker|duskwalker]]_, _[[monsters/Ghost|ghost]]_ _[[classes/Hunter|hunter]]_ racial trait.

**Benefit:** You can use your _ghost_ _hunter_ ability to grant your weapons the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]]_ special ability as a swift action. You can activate _ghost_ _hunter_ an additional time each day.
