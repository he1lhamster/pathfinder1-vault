# Arcing Lob

You can hurl a splash weapon high into the air to break atop large opponents, cascading its contents down on your target or using your opponent's bulk to _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ the surrounding area from the spray.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15, _[[feats/Point-Blank Shot|Point-Blank Shot]]_, _[[feats/Precise Shot|Precise Shot]]_, _[[feats/Throw Anything|Throw Anything]]_.

**Benefit:** When you hit a target that is Large or larger with a splash weapon, you can choose to deal splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the target, splash damage to no creatures, or splash damage as normal.

**Normal:** If you hit a target that is Large or larger with a splash weapon, choose one of its squares- the splash damage affects creatures within 5 feet of that square.
