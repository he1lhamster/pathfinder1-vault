# Scribe Spell Equation

You pluck runes and glyphs from your crystalline dust and arrange them into an equation that holds magic for later use.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Scribe Scroll|Scribe Scroll]]_, _[[monsters/Aphorite|aphorite]]_, caster level 5th, crystalline dust racial trait.

**Benefit:** You manipulate the runes and glyphs of your crystalline dust into an equation that describes a specific spell. This process is identical to scribing a scroll, except that the spell is stored as a specific pattern in your crystalline dust, visible only to you. You can activate the spell in the same way you would activate a scroll, except that you need only one hand free to trace the final glyph in the equation, releasing the spell. The cost of materials to store a spell equation is the same price as scribing an equivalent scroll. You can have one spell equation stored at a time, plus one additional spell when your character level reaches 10th, 15th, and 20th levels.
