# Stoic Pose

You can hold yourself as still as a _[[spells/Statue|statue]]_, evading detection.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Svirfneblin|Svirfneblin]]_.

**Benefit:** By spending 5 rounds finding a suitable location, you can hold yourself so still that you appear to be a Small object such as a pile of rocks. This allows you to make a Stealth check without cover or concealment, as long as you do not move or take any other actions.
