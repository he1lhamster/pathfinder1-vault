**Prerequisites:** Str 13, two claw natural weapon attacks, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** If you hit a creature with two claw attacks in the same turn, the second claw attack deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. You can use this feat once per round.
