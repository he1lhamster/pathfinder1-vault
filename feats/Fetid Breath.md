# Fetid Breath

The rotting of your flesh has spread to your lungs and fills them with _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Putrid|putrid]]_ fluids.

**Prerequisites:** Con 15, _[[feats/Corrupted Flesh|Corrupted Flesh]]_, 6 HD, _[[monsters/Ogre|ogre]]_.

**Benefit:** You can exhale a 30-foot cone of vile-smelling, moist air mixed with phlegm and remnants of old meals. Creatures in the area must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Constitution modif ier) or they are _[[conditions/Nauseated|nauseated]]_ for 1d6 minutes. Affected creatures that spend a full-round action gasping for fresh air and scraping off your oral debris may attempt another save to overcome the effect. You can use this _[[universal monster rules/Breath Weapon|breath weapon]]_ twice per day, plus one additional time per day for every 6 HD you possess beyond 6.
