# Demoralizing Lash (Combat)

You cow your enemies with the lash of a _[[items/Weapon/Whip|whip]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +1, Intimidate 1 rank, _[[monsters/Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]]_.

**Benefit:** To use this feat, you must use a _whip_ (or another weapon in the flails _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_ weapon group) to attack a foe demoralized by an Intimidate check. If the attack hits, you extend the duration the creature is _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ by 1 round. This feat has no effect on creatures whose _shaken_ conditions are from sources other than Intimidate checks.
