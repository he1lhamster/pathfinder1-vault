# Innocent Blood (Story)

With their deaths, the pitiful wretches that inhabit this world open your path to greatness.

**Prerequisites:** You must slay at least 50 intelligent noncombatants for either your own personal gain or for no cause at all, or have the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Bloodthirsty|Bloodthirsty]]_, First Kill, or The Kill background.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Intimidate, this bonus increases to +4. Each time you slay an intelligent creature, you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and caster level checks for 1 minute (this bonus does not stack with itself ).

**Goal:** Slay at least 200 more intelligent noncombatants, then slay a challenging foe that seeks to either bring you to justice for your crimes or usurp your position.

**Completion Benefit:** Any _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ creature takes double the normal penalties when attacking you, making saves against your abilities, or resolving skill checks with you as a target.
