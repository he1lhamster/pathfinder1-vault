# Disconcerting Stare (Combat, Stare)

Your painful stare unnerves your target, making it oblivious to its surroundings.

**Prerequisites:** _[[classes/Mesmerist|Mesmerist]]_ level 5th, painful stareOA class feature.

**Benefit:** When you trigger your painful stare, the target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your _mesmerist_ level + your Charisma modifier) or take a -6 penalty on Disable Device and Perception checks and a -2 penalty on Reflex saves for the next minute. If the target has the trap finding or trap sense class ability and fails this save, the target also loses the benefit of that ability (or abilities) for 1 minute.
