# Assisted Ascension (Teamwork)

You and your allies have practiced scaling heights together.

**Prerequisites:** Climb 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** When you succeed at a _Climb_ check, allies within 20 feet who also have this feat can _climb_ 5 feet along the same surface as an immediate action. You gain a +5 bonus on _Climb_ checks to catch any falling ally who also has this feat.
