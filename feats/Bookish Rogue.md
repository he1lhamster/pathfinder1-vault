# Bookish Rogue

Thanks to your preparation, your arcane ability is more varied than most.

**Prerequisites:** Minor magic _[[classes/Rogue|rogue]]_ talent.

**Benefit:** By studying a _[[items/Mundane/Spellbook|spellbook]]_ for 10 minutes, you can change one spell you are able to cast using your minor magic or major magic _rogue_ talent to one sorcerer/wizard spell of the same level contained in the _spellbook_. This change is permanent until you take the time to change it via this feat again.
