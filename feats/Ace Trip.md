# Ace Trip (Targeting, Weapon Mastery)

You can _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ flying opponents with your ranged attacks.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Deadly Aim|Deadly Aim]]_, _[[feats/Ranged Trip|Ranged Trip]]_ (Ranged Tactics Toolbox 9), base attack bonus +6, weapon _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ class feature with a ranged weapon.

**Benefit:** You don't take the -2 penalty for making _trip_ attempts with a ranged weapon using _Ranged Trip_, and you can attempt special _ranged trip_ combat maneuver checks against flying creatures. If the combat maneuver succeeds, the target falls at a rate of up to 100 feet per round (assuming it is conscious and attempting to remain airborne; otherwise, it falls at a rate of 500 feet per round) until it hits the ground. Upon _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Impact|impact]]_, it falls _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ and takes falling damage (half the normal damage if it fell 100 feet per round; otherwise, normal damage for the distance _[[monsters/Fallen|fallen]]_). A falling creature is considered _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_ until it hits the ground, but it can attempt a Fly check at the start of its turn to stop falling before it hits the ground (DC = 15 + your base attack bonus); otherwise, it is unable to move (other than falling) but can act normally.
