# Shaping Focus

Your powers of shapeshifting outstrip your dabbling in the druidic faith.

**Prerequisites:** Wild shape class feature, Knowledge (nature) 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** If you are a multiclassed _[[classes/Druid|druid]]_, your wild shape ability is calculated as though your _druid_ level were four higher, to a maximum level equal to your character level.

**Special:** This feat has no effect if you are not a multiclassed _druid_.
