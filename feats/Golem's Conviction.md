# Golem's Conviction

Others whisper that you're little more than a golem obeying orders. They're wrong, but your dedication is clear.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Iron Will|Improved Iron Will]]_, _[[feats/Iron Will|Iron Will]]_, base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit:** When you fail a Will save against a mind-affecting effect that would cause you to lose control of your actions (such as _[[spells/Dominate Person|dominate person]]_ or _[[spells/Hideous Laughter|hideous laughter]]_), you can instead opt to follow a rudimentary programming. For a number of rounds equal to half your level (minimum 1) you gain the _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ condition and must either attack a designated target within 60 feet or hold position. If you hold position, you take the total defense action instead of taking whatever action the mind-affecting effect would force you to take. If you choose to attack a target, you must either make a ranged attack, make a melee attack, or move closer to the designated target. If the mind-affecting effect has not been resolved by the time the effects of this feat end, then you are subject to the effect as normal.
