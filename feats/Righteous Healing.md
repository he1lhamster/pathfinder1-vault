# Righteous Healing

Your healing spells are more _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ when you have a judgment active.

**Prerequisites:** Judgment class feature.

**Benefit:** If you cast a cure spell while you have a judgment active, each target regains 1 extra hit point from the cure spell + 1 hit point per three _[[classes/Inquisitor|inquisitor]]_ levels you possess.
