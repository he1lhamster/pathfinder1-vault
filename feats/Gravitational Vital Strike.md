# Gravitational Vital Strike (Combat)

You use unusual gravities to adjust your vital strikes.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Vital Strike|Vital Strike]]_; _[[feats/Heavy Gravity Acclimation|Heavy Gravity Acclimation]]_* or _[[feats/Light Gravity Acclimation|Light Gravity Acclimation]]_*.

**Benefit:** When using any _Vital Strike_ feat in an area of light or heavy gravity, roll the weapon's damage dice for the attack one additional time. For example, if using _[[feats/Improved Vital Strike|Improved Vital Strike]]_, you would roll the weapon's damage dice for the attack four times before adding other damage bonuses, instead of three times. You must have the appropriate prerequisite feat associated with the plane's gravity trait to gain this benefit.
