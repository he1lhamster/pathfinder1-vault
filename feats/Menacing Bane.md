# Menacing Bane

You are _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ when you _[[feats/Team Up|team up]]_ with allies against a single foe.

**Prerequisites:** _[[spells/Bane|Bane]]_ class feature.

**Benefit:** You can use your _bane_ class feature to imbue a melee weapon with the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Menacing|menacing]]_ special weapon ability (Advanced Player's Guide 288) instead of _bane_. You can spend a swift action to switch between the two special weapon abilities. Doing so otherwise works according to your _bane_ class feature.

**Special:** If you have the _[[feats/Double Bane|Double Bane]]_ feat, you can imbue each weapon you wield with either _bane_ or _menacing_. No single weapon can have both.
