# Abeyance (Blood Hex)

You can disrupt your opponent's connection to its own magical power.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, Spellcraft 5 ranks, Use Magic Device 1 rank.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can drain the innate magical ability of a creature you've dealt damage to with a metal weapon since the beginning of your last turn. That creature must succeed at a Will save or be unable to access any _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ it can use more than once per day, until it is healed of all hit point damage, or up to a maximum duration of 1 minute.

**Special:** If a _[[classes/Shaman|shaman]]_ or _[[classes/Witch|witch]]_ uses this blood hex, the target is unable to use any of its _spell-like abilities_ for the hex's duration.
