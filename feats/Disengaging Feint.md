# Disengaging Feint (Combat)

You can feint to disengage from combat.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Improved Feint|Improved Feint]]_.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, use Bluff to feint against an opponent. Instead of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Denying|denying]]_ that opponent his Dexterity bonus to AC, a successful feint allows you to move up to your speed without provoking an attack of opportunity from the opponent you feinted for leaving the square you start in.
