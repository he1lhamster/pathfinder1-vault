# Old As Dust

You have been dead for so long you have become quite difficult to kill.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Sleeper|Sleeper]]_, _[[feats/Warren Digger|Warren Digger]]_, creature has been a _[[monsters/Ghoul|ghoul]]_ for at least 500 years.

**Benefit:** When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you are not destroyed-you cannot be killed unless your body is completely destroyed with fire or doused in _[[items/Mundane/Holy water|holy water]]_, or you take damage from a cure spell or channeled positive energy after you've been reduced to 0 hit points. Anytime you are reduced to 0 hit points, you remain _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_ until you are healed or until the following midnight, at which time you regain 1 hit point per Hit Die and _[[spells/Awaken|awaken]]_.
