# Master Sniper (Combat)

Your sniping is quick enough that you can fire a small volley unnoticed.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Expert Sniper|Expert Sniper]]_, _[[feats/Rapid Shot|Rapid Shot]]_, Stealth 6 ranks.

**Benefit:** While hiding, you can make two ranged attacks at your highest attack bonus as a full-round action and then immediately use Stealth again. You take the normal penalties on your Stealth check to remain hidden. Effects that modify sniping apply to this full-round action. These attack rolls take a -2 penalty.

**Normal:** You can fire only once when sniping.
