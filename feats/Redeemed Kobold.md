# Redeemed Kobold

The purity you have found in the teachings of good dragonkind colors your scales and grants you confidence.

**Prerequisites:** Good alignment, _[[monsters/Kobold|kobold]]_.

**Benefit:** Your scales take on a metallic sheen appropriate for that of a good-aligned metallic dragon who shares any existing energy affinity you possess, or whom you have chosen to emulate. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks when interacting with good creatures. In addition, your Charisma is considered 2 points higher for the purposes of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Channeling|channeling]]_ positive energy.
