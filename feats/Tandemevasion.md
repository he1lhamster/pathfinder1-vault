# Tandemevasion (Combat, Teamwork)

You and your allies help each other evade _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ attacks.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Dodge|Dodge]]_.

**Benefit:** When adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you gain evasion against a _[[spells/Dragon's Breath|dragon's breath]]_ weapon and tail sweep special attacks. If you already have evasion, you gain improved evasion instead.
