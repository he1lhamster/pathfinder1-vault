# Deadly Grappler (Combat)

While you're _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_, you become even more dangerous.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_.

**Benefit:** You have learned to leverage a grappling creature's weight against it. While you're _grappled_, attacks you make against the grappler using armor spikes, a light or one-handed weapon, a natural weapon, or an unarmed strike deal damage as if the strike or weapon were one size category larger than it actually is.
