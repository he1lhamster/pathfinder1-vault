# Wolf Savage (Combat, Style)

You can savage vulnerable foes so badly they become supernaturally disfigured.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 17, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Wolf Style|Wolf Style]]_, _[[feats/Wolf Trip|Wolf Trip]]_, Knowledge (nature) 9 ranks.

**Benefit:** Whenever you deal a _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ opponent at least 10 points of damage with a natural weapon or unarmed strike, you can savage your foe as a swift action. Your victim becomes disf igured unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modif ier). The effects of this disf igurement are identical to those of a _[[spells/Bestow Curse|bestow curse]]_ spell (caster level equal to your character level).
