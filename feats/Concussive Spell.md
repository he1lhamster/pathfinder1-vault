# Concussive Spell (Metamagic)

You cause creatures to be disoriented when you affect them with a spell that has the sonic descriptor.

**Benefit:** With sonic damage comes a concussive wave of energy that rattles creatures affected by the spell. A _[[feats/Concussive Spell|concussive spell]]_ causes creatures that take damage from a spell that has the sonic descriptor to take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for a number of rounds equal to the actual spell level of the spell. A _concussive spell_ only affects spells with the sonic descriptor. A _concussive spell_ uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.
