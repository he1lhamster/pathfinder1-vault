# Firesight

Fire no longer blinds you, and smoke conceals nothing from your _[[universal monster rules/Gaze|gaze]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Ifrit|Ifrit]]_.

**Benefit:** You can see through fire and smoke without penalty, ignoring any cover or concealment bonuses from fire and smoke. This does not allow you to see anything you could not otherwise see (for example, _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ creatures are still _invisible_). You are immune to the _[[conditions/Dazzled|dazzled]]_ condition.
