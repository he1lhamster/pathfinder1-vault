# Blinded Blade Style (Combat, Style)

You hold no _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ of blindness, as your other senses improve without the distractions of sight.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Blind-Fight|Blind-Fight]]_, Perception 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** While you are using this style, you gain a number of benefits whenever you are _[[conditions/Blinded|blinded]]_ or unable to see (including when you wear a blindfold or close your eyes). Under such circumstances, you do not take any penalties on Strength- or Dexterity-based skill checks due to blindness. In addition, you gain a +4 bonus on hearing- and smell-based Perception checks and gain the _[[universal monster rules/Scent|scent]]_ special ability with a range of 10 feet; if you already have _scent_, the range of your _scent_ ability increases by 10 feet instead. Having this feat counts as having 10 ranks in Perception for the purpose of satisfying the prerequisites of the Improved Blind-FightAPG feat, as well as any feat that lists Improved Blind-FightAPG as a prerequisite.
