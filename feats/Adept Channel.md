# Adept Channel

Some _[[monsters/Orc|orc]]_ adepts enjoy a greater connection to their gods, and can channel their faith through their _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Unholy|unholy]]_ symbols. You gain the ability to channel energy as a _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to cast divine spells, _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ familiar class ability, caster level 4th, Cha 13.

**Benefit:** You gain the channel energy class feature, as a _cleric_, usable 2 times per day. This ability otherwise functions like the _cleric_'s channel energy ability, except that your effective _cleric_ level is equal to your divine spellcasting class level -3. Unlike a _cleric_, however, the number of times per day you may channel energy is not affected by your Charisma modifier.
