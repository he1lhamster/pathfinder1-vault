# Timely Coordination (Teamwork)

You can precisely time your teamwork.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and skill checks made as part of readied actions triggered by one of your allies who also has this feat. When you and an ally who also has this feat are attempting to overcome separate simultaneous obstacles as part of a heist or infiltration (see page 127), you also gain this +1 bonus on attack rolls and skill checks.
