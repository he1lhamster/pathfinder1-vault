# Thundering Spell (Metamagic)

You can conjure your spells into existence with blaring thunder or fearful shrieks, deafening creatures damaged by their effects.

**Benefit:** You can modify a spell to deafen a creature damaged by the spell. When a creature takes damage from this spell, it becomes _[[conditions/Deafened|deafened]]_ for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the deafening effect. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can make a Fortitude save to negate the deafening effect. If the spell effect also causes the creature to become _deafened_, the duration of this metamagic effect is added to the duration of the spell. A _[[feats/Thundering Spell|thundering spell]]_ uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level. Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.
