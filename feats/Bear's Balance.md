# Bear's Balance (Combat)

Your anger is always available below the surface, but can be carefully directed. Those who would force you to lose control encounter an unpleasant surprise.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Iron Will|Iron Will]]_, _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ class feature.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks when not raging. When you fail a saving throw against a _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effect, you can choose to enter your _rage_ rather than succumb to _fear_. You can not voluntarily end your _rage_ until the _fear_ effect expires or is ended in some other way (such as due to the death of the fear-inducing creature) or you exhaust your rounds of _rage_ for the day. This feat has no effect if you are already raging when exposed to a _fear_ effect.
