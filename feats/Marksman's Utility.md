# Marksman's Utility (Weapon Mastery)

Your mastery of ranged weapons enables you to use them to perform deeds that you would normally need a firearm to accomplish.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +6, weapon _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ class feature with a ranged weapon.

**Benefit:** You can perform the utility shotUC _[[classes/Gunslinger|gunslinger]]_ deed with an appropriate ranged weapon with which you are proficient. If you have both the utility shot deed and this feat, you gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls made as part of a utility shot and you can use the utility shot deed while you have no grit points.

**Special:** A gunslingerUC can ignore the weapon _training_ class feature prerequisite of Marksman's Deed.
