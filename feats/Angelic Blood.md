# Angelic Blood

Your blood is infused with holy power.

**Prerequisites:** Con 13, _[[monsters/Aasimar|aasimar]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against effects with the evil descriptor and on Constitution checks to stabilize when you are reduced to negative hit points (but not dead). Furthermore, each time you take _[[universal monster rules/Bleed|bleed]]_ or _[[universal monster rules/Blood Drain|blood drain]]_ damage, each undead creature or creature with the evil subtype that is currently adjacent to you also takes 1 point of damage.
