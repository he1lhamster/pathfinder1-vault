# Out Of The Sun (Teamwork)

Your allies use the sun's glare to their advantage.

**Prerequisites:** Bluff 3 ranks, Stealth 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** When you hit with a melee attack, you can attempt a Bluff check as a move action to feint. You do not gain the benefits of this feint; instead, if your Bluff check is successful, an ally with this feat who is adjacent to you or your opponent gains the benefits, so that her next melee attack against that opponent does not allow him to use his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). This attack must be made on or before your ally's next turn. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your Bluff check in bright light. This bonus increases to +4 in natural sunlight. You cannot use this feat in dim light or _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_.

**Special:** If you have the _[[feats/Improved Feint|Improved Feint]]_ feat, you can feint with _[[feats/Out Of The Sun|Out of the Sun]]_ as a swift action after you hit with a melee attack.
