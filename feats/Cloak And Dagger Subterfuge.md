# Cloak And Dagger Subterfuge (Combat)

Your increased martial skill allows you to take advantage of distracted foes to easily impose conditions, and even steal items without being noticed.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Cloak And _[[items/Weapon/Dagger|Dagger]]_ Style|Cloak and _Dagger_ Style]]_, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, Improved Dirty TrickAPG, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ with the chosen weapon, base attack bonus +11.

**Benefit:** While you are using _Cloak and _Dagger_ Style_ and wielding your chosen weapon, whenever you make an attack of opportunity against a target, you can attempt a free dirty trickAPG combat maneuver check against the target as a free action as well. Additionally, whenever you successfully perform a dirty trick maneuver against a target, you can immediately attempt a stealAPG combat maneuver check against the target as a free action. If you succeed, the target is unaware you have stolen an item.
