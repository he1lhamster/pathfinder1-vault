# Liberator (Story)

Your time in shackles has forever marked your soul.

**Prerequisites:** You must have been enslaved for at least 6 months, or have the Imprisoned or Kidnapped background.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and skill checks when your actions would directly lead to freeing prisoners or slaves.

**Goal:** Free at least 200 slaves through perilous rescues (not merely buying them at market).

**Completion Benefit:** You gain the ability to inspire others through your dedication to your cause. Allies within 20 feet receive your _[[feats/Liberator|Liberator]]_ feat bonuses when working with you to free prisoners or slaves. In addition, as a standard action you can inspire slaves and former slaves within 120 feet, giving them temporary hit points equal to 1/2 your character level and a +1 bonus on saving throws. These benefits last for 1 hour, and a given creature can receive this benefit only once per day. These are mind-affecting effects, and the inspiring bonus is language-dependent.
