# Bushwhack (Combat)

You can subdue an unsuspecting foe quickly.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_.

**Benefit:** When a _[[conditions/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]_ creature is unaware of your presence and you successfully grapple it, you can attempt a second grapple combat maneuver check to pin the creature as a free action. If you have the _[[feats/Chokehold|Chokehold]]_ feat (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 92), you can instead use this second combat maneuver check to _[[npcs/Initiate|initiate]]_ a _chokehold_.
