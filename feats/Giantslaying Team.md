# Giantslaying Team (Combat, Teamwork)

When a giant attempts to hit your ally, that giant unwittingly reveals an opening in her defenses.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Dodge|Dodge]]_, _[[feats/Mobility|Mobility]]_, base attack bonus +4, defensive _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ racial trait.

**Benefit:** Whenever a foe with the giant subtype you threaten misses with an attack of opportunity against an ally with this feat, you can make a melee attack against that giant as an immediate action.
