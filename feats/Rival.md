# Rival (Story)

You have a _[[feats/Rival|rival]]_, and the two of you try to sabotage, humiliate, or otherwise defeat each other without allowing anyone else to interfere.

**Prerequisites:** You must have at least one enemy who wishes to outdo you. If you have multiple rivals, the GM may keep the specific _rival_ secret, or have many of your enemies work together against you. If your _rival_ is not already a challenging foe, it either advances to become one or allies itself with others one or more creatures who are.

**Benefit:** Your striving pushes you to become ever more skillful. When you gain this feat, and every 2 character levels thereafter, either you gain 1 skill point or your Fame score increases by 1 (if your game uses the reputation and Fame system from Ultimate Campaign).

**Goal:** Thwart your _rival_ without anyone else directly interfering. Achieving your _rival_'s goal before her in a manner that humiliates her or completely steals her glory through your direct actions also qualifies.

**Completion Benefit:** Once per day, you can take 20 on a single skill check as a standard action if the skill check is one that would allow you to take 20.

**Special:** Thwarting you becomes an all-consuming goal for your _rival_. Your _rival_ gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks, saving throws, and skill checks against you. Your _rival_ attempts to steal or _[[feats/Undermine|undermine]]_ accomplishments which you strive to achieve.
