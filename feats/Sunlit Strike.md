# Sunlit Strike

Your melee blows deal extra damage to creatures sensitive to light, making you adept at hunting foul monsters of the night.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Arcane Strike|Arcane Strike]]_, able to prepare or cast sunlight.

**Benefit:** Whenever you successfully hit an enemy that is vulnerable to light (such as by the _[[universal monster rules/Light Blindness|light blindness]]_, _[[universal monster rules/Light Sensitivity|light sensitivity]]_, or _[[universal monster rules/Sunlight Powerlessness|sunlight powerlessness]]_ universal monster rules) with a melee weapon you've imbued with your _Arcane Strike_ feat, you deal an additional 1d6 points of damage to the target of your attack. The struck creature must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + your character level + your Strength modifier) or become _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1 round.
