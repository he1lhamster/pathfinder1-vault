# Manifested Blood

You can use the power of your bloodline to surround yourself in its element.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13; draconic or elemental bloodline.

**Benefit:** Once per day, you can surround yourself with the element associated with your bloodline. For a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), you gain _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ 5 to that energy type, and all creatures that attempt a natural weapon attack or an unarmed strike against you take 2 points of damage of that same energy type. If you already have _resistance_ to that energy type, the _resistance_ increases by 5.

**Special:** You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you gain an additional daily use of this feat.
