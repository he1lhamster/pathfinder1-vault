# Legendary Influence

Each legend grants you more of its power in return for greater inf luence.

**Prerequisites:** Lesser spirit powerOA class feature.

**Benefit:** Immediately select one feat (other than an item creation feat) for each spirit you can channel. Whenever you perform a seance to channel a spirit, you can allow the spirit to gain 1 point of inf luence over you to gain access to that spirit's Legendary Inf luence feat for as long as you channel that spirit. You can use this bonus feat as a prerequisite for any feats granted by a spirit power (such as the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Champion|champion]]_'s legendary _champion_ ability), but not for any other feats.
