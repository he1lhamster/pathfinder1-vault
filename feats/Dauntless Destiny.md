# Dauntless Destiny

Your ability to avert disaster is impressive.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, _[[feats/Fearless Curiosity|Fearless Curiosity]]_, Intimidate 10 ranks, human.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on saving throws against effects with the emotion descriptor; this bonus stacks with those granted by _Fearless Curiosity_ and _[[feats/Intimidating Confidence|Intimidating Confidence]]_. In addition, once per day you may reroll a natural 1 on a saving throw or an attack roll. If your reroll results in a successful saving throw or attack roll, as a free action you can make an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of your attack or the creature that forced you to make a saving throw, as long as the creature is within 30 feet and can see and hear you. This effect does not apply on saving throws against traps or other objects. This does not stack with other effects that allow you to reroll a saving throw or an attack roll. You may only make one reroll.
