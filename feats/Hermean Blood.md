# Hermean Blood

You are the descendant of someone recruited to Hermea or the bastard result of a Hermean's illicit pairing with someone foreign to that land.

**Prerequisites:** You may only gain this feat at 1st level.

**Benefit:** Though you may not know it, the blood of greatness flows in your veins. Pick two skills that share the same associated ability score. Those skills are always considered class skills for you. It's possible that Hermean agents may come looking for you, either to evaluate you for an invitation or to cover up an embarrassing dalliance, as determined by the GM's whim.
