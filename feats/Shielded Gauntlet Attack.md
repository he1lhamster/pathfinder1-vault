# Shielded Gauntlet Attack (Combat)

Your _[[items/Weapon/Gauntlet|gauntlet]]_ helps you take advantage of weakness.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Shield _Gauntlet_ Style|Shield _Gauntlet_ Style]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_gauntlet_ or _[[items/Weapon/Spiked gauntlet|spiked gauntlet]]_), proficiency with bucklers and light shields.

**Benefit:** While using _Shield _Gauntlet_ Style_, you can calculate the damage of your _gauntlet_ or _spiked gauntlet_ using the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sacred|sacred]]_ weapon damage value of a warpriestACG with a level 4 less than your base attack bonus. The style also allows you to take one attack of opportunity each round that does not count toward your maximum number of attacks of opportunity. This must be used to make an attack with your _gauntlet_ (or _spiked gauntlet_), or a disarm or stealAPG combat maneuver. You do not provoke an attack of opportunity for performing either combat maneuver, and you are able to attempt a steal combat maneuver with this attack of opportunity despite the maneuver normally requiring a standard action.
