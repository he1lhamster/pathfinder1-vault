# Tenacious Spell (Metamagic)

Your magic is difficult to unravel.

**Benefit:** Increase the DC of caster level checks to counter or dispel a _[[feats/Tenacious Spell|tenacious spell]]_ by 2. If a _tenacious spell_ is dispelled or dismissed, it lasts for 1d4 further rounds (to a maximum of the spell's normal duration) before ending (this does not occur if _[[spells/Antimagic Field|antimagic field]]_ or a similar spell or effect suppresses or ends the spell's effect without _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Dispelling|dispelling]]_ or dismissing it). The lingering auras of tenacious spells detectable with _[[spells/Detect Magic|detect magic]]_ last for twice as long as usual after the spells end. A _tenacious spell_ uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.
