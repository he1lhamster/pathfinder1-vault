# Bloodmarked Flight

Your attunement to your werebat ancestry has allowed you to master a crude form of _[[universal monster rules/Flight|flight]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +5, werebat-kin.

**Benefit:** As an additional bestial feature, you can use your _[[universal monster rules/Change Shape|change shape]]_ ability to gain a fly speed of 30 feet with poor maneuverability if carrying a light load and wearing no armor or light armor, or a fly speed of 20 feet with clumsy maneuverability if carrying a _[[classes/Medium|medium]]_ or heavy load or wearing _medium_ or heavy armor.
