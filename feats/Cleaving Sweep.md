# Cleaving Sweep (Combat)

You can sweep multiple foes to the ground with a single blow of your axe.

**Prerequisites:** Str 15, _[[feats/Cleave|Cleave]]_, _[[feats/Improved Trip|Improved Trip]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_[[items/Weapon/Greataxe|greataxe]]_), base attack bonus +11.

**Benefit:** When using a full-attack action with a two-handed weapon, you can give up your regular attacks and instead attempt a _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ combat maneuver at your highest base attack bonus against each opponent within reach. You must attempt a separate combat maneuver check against each opponent.
