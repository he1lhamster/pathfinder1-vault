# Greater Eldritch Heritage

Your discovered bloodline power reaches its zenith.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 17, _[[feats/Eldritch Heritage|Eldritch Heritage]]_, _[[feats/Improved Eldritch Heritage|Improved Eldritch Heritage]]_, character level 17th.

**Benefit:** You gain an additional power from the bloodline you selected with the _Eldritch Heritage_ feat. You gain a 15th-level (or lower) _[[classes/Sorcerer|sorcerer]]_ bloodline power that you do not already have. For purposes of using that power, treat your character level as your _sorcerer_ level for all your _sorcerer_ bloodline powers granted by this feat, _Eldritch Heritage_, and _Improved Eldritch Heritage_.
