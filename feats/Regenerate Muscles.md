# Regenerate Muscles

You use your powerful metabolism to temporarily increase the strength of your muscles, but doing so costs you your _[[universal monster rules/Regeneration|regeneration]]_ powers.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, _regeneration_, _[[monsters/Troll|troll]]_.

**Benefit:** As a free action, you can make your _regeneration_ stop working for 1 minute and gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your Strength. You lose your _regeneration_ ability while you benef it from this bonus to Strength and for 1 minute afterward. You can end this ability early as a free action. You can activate this ability only if your _regeneration_ is functioning.
