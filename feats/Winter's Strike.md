# Winter's Strike (Combat)

Your attacks afflict your foes with the relentless fatigue of a winter storm.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Nature Magic|Nature Magic]]_ or the ability to cast _[[classes/Druid|druid]]_ or _[[classes/Ranger|ranger]]_ spells; _[[feats/Vital Strike|Vital Strike]]_, Knowledge (nature) 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** A number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), when you use _Vital Strike_ (or _[[feats/Improved Vital Strike|Improved Vital Strike]]_ or _[[feats/Greater Vital Strike|Greater Vital Strike]]_), your strike saps the strength of your opponent. The creature hit must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier) or become _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_ for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). You can choose to use this ability as a free action after you hit the target with the attack. This is a supernatural ability.
