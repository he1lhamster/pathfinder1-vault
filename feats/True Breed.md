# True Breed

Your dual heritage makes you something more than merely a mix of your parent races.

**Prerequisites:** Two subtypes, elf blood or _[[monsters/Orc|orc]]_ blood racial trait.

**Benefit:** For the purposes of any effect related to subtype (such as a _[[classes/Ranger|ranger]]_'s favored enemy and _[[spells/Bane|bane]]_ weapons), you count as neither of your subtypes, and you no longer count as either of your parent races for the purposes of effects related to race.
