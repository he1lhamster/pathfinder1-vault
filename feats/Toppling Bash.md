# Toppling Bash (Shield Mastery)

Your _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ bash throws your enemies off balance.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved _Shield_ Bash|Improved _Shield_ Bash]]_, _[[feats/Shield Focus|Shield Focus]]_, _[[feats/Stumbling Bash|Stumbling Bash]]_, base attack bonus +11 or _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_ level 8th.

**Benefit:** As a swift action when you hit a creature with a _shield_ bash, you can attempt a _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ combat maneuver against that creature at a -5 penalty. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity, and if your attempt fails by 10 or more, you are not knocked _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_.
