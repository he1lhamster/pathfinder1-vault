# Expert Driver

When driving a chosen type of vehicle, you exhibit incredible control, maneuvering the vehicle with greater ease and stopping with uncanny precision.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Skilled Driver|Skilled Driver]]_ with the selected vehicle type.

**Benefit:** You can make an accelerate, decelerate, or turn action as a move action instead of a standard action. Furthermore, when stopping a vehicle, you subtract 10 feet from the roll to determine how many feet the vehicle moves forward before it stops.
