# Pattern Message

You've become skilled at inserting secret messages into your pattern illusions.

**Prerequisites:** Caster level 3rd.

**Benefit:** When you cast a spell from the pattern subschool, you can embed a short _[[spells/Message|message]]_ within the effect. You designate any number of the spell's targets to receive this encoded _message_, regardless of language, but only a creature failing its save against your pattern spell can receive your _message_. This _message_ is delivered visually, and there is no verbal component that other creatures might overhear. During each round you concentrate to maintain a pattern spell, you can change the embedded _message_ and the targets that receive it.
