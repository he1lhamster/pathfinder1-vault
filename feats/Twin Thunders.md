# Twin Thunders (Combat)

When you fight giants, your powerful blows combine with skills learned from generations of your people to quickly even the odds.

**Prerequisites:** Dwarf or gnome, defensive _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ racial trait, _[[feats/Two-Weapon Fighting|Two-Weapon Fighting]]_ or flurry of blows class feature, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ with both wielded weapons.

**Benefit:** Once per round, when wielding a bludgeoning weapon in each hand against a creature with the giant subtype, if you hit the creature with your off-hand weapon after you hit with your primary weapon, roll the damage dice for your off-hand weapon twice and add the results together before adding any bonuses. Such extra weapon damage dice are not multiplied on a critical hit.
