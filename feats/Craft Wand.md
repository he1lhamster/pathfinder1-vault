# Craft Wand (Item Creation)

You can create magic wands.

**Prerequisites:** Caster level 5th.

**Benefit:** You can create a wand of any 4th-level or lower spell that you know. Crafting a wand takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a wand, you must use up raw materials costing half of this base price. A newly created wand has 50 charges. See the magic item creation rules in Chapter 15 for more information.
