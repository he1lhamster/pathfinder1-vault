# Intimidating Bane

Your _[[spells/Bane|bane]]_ weapon strikes _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ into your enemies.

**Prerequisites:** _Bane_ class feature, _[[feats/Dazzling Display|Dazzling Display]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_, character level 8th.

**Benefit:** Whenever you use _Dazzling Display_ while your _bane_ feature is active, you gain a +2 bonus on the Intimidate check that _Dazzling Display_ allows against creatures of the type your _bane_ weapon currently affects. Such creatures remain _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ while your _bane_ feature is still active and effective against their creature type.
