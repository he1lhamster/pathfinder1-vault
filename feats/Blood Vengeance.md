# Blood Vengeance

Seeing an ally fall in combat fills you with a murderous fury.

**Prerequisites:** Half-orc or _[[monsters/Orc|orc]]_, non-lawful.

**Benefit:** Whenever one of your worthy allies is brought to negative hit points or killed, you may enter a state similar to but less powerful than a _[[classes/Barbarian|barbarian]]_'s _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ as a free action on your turn. If you have the _rage_ class feature and are already raging, your morale bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by +2 for the duration of your _rage_. If you do not have the _rage_ class feature, or you have no more _rage_ rounds left, this weaker _rage_ gives you all the benefits and penalties of a _rage_, except your morale bonus to Strength and Constitution is only +2, and this state lasts for 4 rounds. As with a _barbarian_'s _rage_, when this weaker _rage_ ends, you are _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_; if another ally falls before this duration ends, the weaker _rage_ lasts for 4 more rounds after that. This feat does not allow you to enter a _rage_ if you are _fatigued_. You may only use this feat if the _[[monsters/Fallen|fallen]]_ ally had at least as many Hit Dice as you.
