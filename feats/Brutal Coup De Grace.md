**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Dazzling Display|Dazzling Display]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_, base attack bonus +5, proficiency with the selected weapon.

**Benefit:** When you deliver a coup de _[[spells/Grace|grace]]_ with the selected weapon and kill the target, enemies within 30 feet of you who can see or hear you must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma bonus) or become _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_.
