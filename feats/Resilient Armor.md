# Resilient Armor

When you enhance your armor or _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_, you gain a measure of _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Divine bond (armor or _shield_) or _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sacred|sacred]]_ armor class feature.

**Benefit:** While your armor or _shield_ is under the effect of your divine bond or your _sacred_ armor ability, you gain an amount of _damage reduction_ equal to your armor's enhancement bonus (including the bonus from your divine bond or _sacred_ armor) against the first attack to strike you in each round. An adamantine weapon overcomes this _damage reduction_, but any attack against you made with such a weapon does not count against this effect's duration.
