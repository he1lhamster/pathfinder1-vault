# Mobile Bulwark Style (Combat, Style)

You are able to swing your _[[items/Shield/Tower shield|tower shield]]_ around quickly.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Shield Focus|Shield Focus]]_, _[[feats/Tower _[[spells/Shield|Shield]]_ Proficiency|Tower _Shield_ Proficiency]]_, base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** While using a _tower shield_, add the _shield_'s bonus to AC (including its enhancement bonus) to your CMD against bull rush and overrun combat maneuvers. While using this style, you can use a _tower shield_ to grant you total cover along one edge of your space (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook 153) as a move action.
