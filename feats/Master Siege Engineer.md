# Master Siege Engineer (Combat)

You are significantly faster at loading a siege engine, as well as a better shot.

**Prerequisites:** Siege Weapon Engineer, Knowledge (engineering) 10 ranks.

**Benefit:** If you are the crew lead on a siege engine, your crew can use move actions to load a siege engine. When you spend actions to aim a siege engine, you and your crew can use move actions instead of full-round actions to aim the siege engine (page 160).

**Normal:** Full-round actions are required to load and aim siege engines.
