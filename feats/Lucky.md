# Lucky

Your luck-based abilities seem limitless.

**Prerequisites:** Black CatARG or _[[feats/Lucky|Lucky]]_ Half lingARG; must have a racial trait with "luck" in its name.

**Benefit:** Choose one of the following feats: _[[feats/Black Cat|Black Cat]]_, _Lucky_ Half ling, or any feat that lists one of these feats as a prerequisite and is usable once per day. Add two to the number of times per day that you can use the chosen feat. You must have the chosen feat in order to select it with _Lucky_.

**Special:** This feat can be selected multiple times. You cannot add more than six uses to a single feat in this manner. A character with the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Defiant|Defiant]]_ LuckARG feat can ignore this feat's prerequisites, but she must choose _[[feats/Defiant Luck|Defiant Luck]]_ or a feat that lists _Defiant Luck_ as a prerequisite and is usable once per day.
