# Seize Advantage (Combat)

You can take advantage of your foes when they overcommit on their attacks.

**Prerequisites:** Opportune parry and riposte deed.

**Benefit:** When your foe is using _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_ and you successfully use the opportune parry and riposte deed to parry its attack and then respond with a riposte, you add your foe's current bonus on damage rolls from _Power Attack_ to your own damage roll, but you do not take the penalty to hit from your foe's _Power Attack_.
