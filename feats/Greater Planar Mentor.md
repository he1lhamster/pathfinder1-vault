# Greater Planar Mentor

Your mentor begins to look upon you as an equal and can even answer your call.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Planar|Planar]]_ Mentor|Improved _Planar_ Mentor]]_*, _[[feats/Planar Mentor|Planar Mentor]]_*, character level 13th.

**Benefit:** You can benefit from your _Planar Mentor_ feat one additional time per day. You add the following to the list of _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ you can cast using _Improved _Planar_ Mentor_ for their respective alignments, each of which affects only a single target within 30 feet: _[[spells/Blasphemy|blasphemy]]_ (evil), _[[spells/Dictum|dictum]]_ (lawful), _[[spells/Holy Word|holy word]]_ (good), _[[spells/Slay Living|slay living]]_ (neutral), and _[[spells/Word Of Chaos|word of chaos]]_ (chaotic). Once per week you can cast greater _[[spells/Planar Ally|planar ally]]_ as a spell-like ability, but only to conjure your _planar mentor_. Your mentor requires only half the normal payment for its services.
