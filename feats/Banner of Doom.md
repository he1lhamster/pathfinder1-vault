# Banner of Doom (Combat)

The mere sight of your fiendish _[[items/Mundane/Banner|banner]]_ is enough to send ripples of _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ through your enemies.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +8, _banner_ class feature, _[[monsters/Tiefling|tiefling]]_.

**Benefit:** As long your _banner_ is clearly visible, all enemies within 60 feet take a -2 penalty on saving throws against _fear_. This penalty does not stack with other effects that provide enemies with penalties on saving throws against _fear_.
