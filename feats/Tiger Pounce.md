# Tiger Pounce (Combat)

Your unarmed strikes are as precise as they are powerful, but they leave you open and you can pursue foes with _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Blinding|blinding]]_ speed.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, _[[feats/Tiger Claws|Tiger Claws]]_, _[[feats/Tiger Style|Tiger Style]]_, base attack bonus +9 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 8th.

**Benefit:** While using the _Tiger Style_ feat, you can apply the penalty from _Power Attack_ to your AC instead of attack rolls. Additionally, once per round as a swift action, you can move up to half your speed closer to a target you hit with an unarmed strike or made a successful combat maneuver against on this turn or your last turn.
