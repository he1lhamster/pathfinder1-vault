# Radiant Charge

When you charge, you do so with the power of faith.

**Prerequisites:** Lay on hands class feature.

**Benefit:** When you hit with a charge attack, you can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ all of your remaining uses of lay on hands to deal extra damage equal to 1d6 per use of lay on hands expended + your Charisma bonus. This damage comes from holy power and is not subject to _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_, energy immunities, or energy resistances.
