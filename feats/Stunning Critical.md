# Stunning Critical (Combat, Critical)

Your critical hits cause opponents to become _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Critical Focus|Critical Focus]]_, _[[feats/Staggering Critical|Staggering Critical]]_, base attack bonus +17.

**Benefit:** Whenever you score a critical hit, your opponent becomes _stunned_ for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save reduces this to _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. The effects of this feat do not stack. Additional hits instead add to the duration.

**Special:** You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess _[[feats/Critical Mastery|Critical Mastery]]_.
