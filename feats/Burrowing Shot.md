# Burrowing Shot (Weapon Mastery)

You lodge your ranged weapons within your target's body.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Deadly Aim|Deadly Aim]]_, base attack bonus +9, weapon _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ class feature with a ranged weapon.

**Benefit:** When you successfully hit a creature with a ranged attack, as a swift action, you can have the weapon (or its ammunition, for projectile weapons) lodge itself within the creature's body, causing the creature to take a -2 penalty on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks as a result of the _[[feats/Intense Pain|intense pain]]_. Penalties from multiple lodged weapons do not stack. If the creature is a spellcaster, it gains a 25% spell failure chance with all spells it casts that include somatic components. This penalty can be removed with the treat _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ wounds use of the _[[spells/Heal|Heal]]_ skill or by removing the lodged weapon as a standard action, which ends the penalties and causes the creature to take an amount of damage equal to the weapon's base damage (without any bonuses).
