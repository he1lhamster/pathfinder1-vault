# Cloak And Dagger Tactics (Combat)

You devastate enemies that you _[[feats/Catch Off-Guard|catch off-guard]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Cloak And _[[items/Weapon/Dagger|Dagger]]_ Style|Cloak and _Dagger_ Style]]_, _[[feats/Cloak And _Dagger_ Subterfuge|Cloak and _Dagger_ Subterfuge]]_, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, Improved Dirty TrickAPG, _[[feats/Vital Strike|Vital Strike]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ with the chosen weapon, base attack bonus +16.

**Benefit:** While you are using _Cloak and _Dagger_ Style_ and wielding your chosen weapon, whenever you hit an opponent that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC or that you are flanking, or make an attack using _Vital Strike_ (or its improved or greater versions), you can attempt a dirty trickAPG combat maneuver check against that opponent as a free action. If you succeed, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier) or take an additional penalty from the dirty trick selected from the following list: anchored in place and unable to move from that square, _[[conditions/Confused|confused]]_, _[[conditions/Exhausted|exhausted]]_, or _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_. This additional penalty lasts only 1 round, regardless of how long the dirty trick's normal penalty lasts, and can be removed by the target with a standard action. You can only attempt one free dirty trick combat maneuver check per round using this feat.
