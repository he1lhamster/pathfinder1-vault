# City-Locked (Story)

Your soul craves travel through wild places, but you are stuck in a sedentary urban life by legal matters, honor-bound duties, or other responsibilities.

**Prerequisites:** You must permanently dwell in a settlement at least as large as a large town. You must also have a fey ancestor somewhere in your family line, or have The Wanderer background (Ultimate Campaign 45).

**Benefit:** When interacting with NPCs who live in your settlement, you gain a +1 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive checks.

**Goal:** Complete the tasks to satisfy the terms of the law, matter of honor, or other responsibility, freeing you to leave the settlement without shame.

**Completion Benefit:** Your newfound _[[spells/Freedom|freedom]]_ inspires your body and mind. You gain a +1 bonus on Dexterity- and Intelligence-based ability checks and skill checks and on Will saving throws.
