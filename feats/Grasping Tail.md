# Grasping Tail

Your tail becomes more useful, and can be used to _[[universal monster rules/Grab|grab]]_ or hold small items.

**Prerequisites:** You must have a tail.

**Benefit:** You can use your tail to _grab_ stowed items. While you cannot wield weapons with your tail, you can use it to retrieve small, stowed objects carried on your person as a swift action.

**Special:** If you have the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Prehensile|prehensile]]_ tail _[[monsters/Tiefling|tiefling]]_ racial trait (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide 169), you can use your tail to _grab_ unattended items within 5 feet or stowed objects carried on your person as a swift action; you can hold such objects with your tail, though you cannot manipulate them with it (other than to put them in your hand).
