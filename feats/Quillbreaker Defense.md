# Quillbreaker Defense (Combat)

You know how to put armor spikes to defensive use by thrusting them into the path of an oncoming attack just in time.

**Prerequisites:** Proficiency with armor spikes.

**Benefit:** If you are wearing armor spikes, as an immediate action when you take damage from a nonmagical attack, you can give your armor spikes the _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ condition to reduce the amount of damage you take by 5. If your armor spikes are already _broken_, they are destroyed when you take the damage. If you are wearing masterwork armor spikes, you instead reduce the damage taken by 10.
