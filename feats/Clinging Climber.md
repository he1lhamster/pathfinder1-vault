# Clinging Climber (Combat)

Using leverage and pure brawn, you can cling to a cliff, rope, or _[[items/Mundane/Ladder|ladder]]_ with your legs to free both of your hands.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, Climb 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** As a move action while climbing, you can cling to your climbing surface with your legs by succeeding at a _Climb_ check (DC = the DC to _climb_ the surface as a move action). If successful, you can make attacks with a two-handed ranged weapon and reload ranged weapons until you resume climbing. The GM may rule that this feat doesn't work on certain climbing surfaces.
