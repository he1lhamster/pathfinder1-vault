# Sun Striker (Combat, Critical)

Called by the Dawnf lower to strike down the undead, your _[[items/Weapon/Scimitar|scimitar]]_ becomes an agent of her _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Burning|burning]]_ will.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Critical Focus|Critical Focus]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_scimitar_), character level 7th, worshiper of Sarenrae.

**Benefit:** Whenever you confirm a critical hit against an undead creature, your attack bypasses all DR, deals full damage to _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ creatures, and acts as though it has the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Flaming Burst|flaming burst]]_ weapon special ability.
