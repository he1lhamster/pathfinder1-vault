# Inexplicable Luck

Others are often dumfounded by your luck.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Defiant Luck|Defiant Luck]]_, human.

**Benefit:** Once per day, as a free action before a roll is made, you gain a +8 bonus on any single d20 roll. You can also use this ability after the roll is made, but if you do, this bonus is reduced to +4.
