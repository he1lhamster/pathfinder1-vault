# Blood For The Empire (Teamwork)

When fighting alongside your allies, the sight of a bloodied foe inspires you to greatness, while a martyred comrade compels you to _[[feats/Vengeance|vengeance]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against a target that was damaged by an ally with this feat within the last round. When an ally with this feat dies within 30 feet of you, you gain the effects of _[[spells/Haste|haste]]_ for 1 round.
