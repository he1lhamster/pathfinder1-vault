# Shadow Dodge

You use shadows to confound your enemies' senses.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, worshiper of Norgorber.

**Benefit:** You can use the light around you to move back and forth from _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|shadow]]_ to light again, and your sudden shifting confuses your enemies' eyes. Each time you move a distance equal to or greater than your speed in areas of normal light or dim light, you gain a +3 _[[feats/Dodge|dodge]]_ bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. Enemies who do not use sight in order to perceive you or are using _[[spells/True Seeing|true seeing]]_ or a similar effect ignore this AC bonus. This feat is ineffective in areas of _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_ or bright light, where one cannot readily shift between light and _shadow_.
