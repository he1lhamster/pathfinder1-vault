# Godless Healing

You have mastered a specialized and complex technique to ignore pain by focusing your belief on the self rather than relying on faith.

**Prerequisites:** Cannot have a patron deity.

**Benefit:** Once per day when you have half your total hit points or fewer, you may _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ yourself of an amount of damage equal to 1d8 plus your total Hit Dice as a move action. This is a supernatural ability.

**Special:** You can take this feat more than once. Each time you do, you may _heal_ yourself one additional time per day.
