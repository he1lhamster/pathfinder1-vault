# Serpent Lash

You are skilled at using rapid lashes of your _[[items/Weapon/Whip|whip]]_ to _[[feats/Snatch|snatch]]_ at targets and draw them to you.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Weapon Finesse|Weapon Finesse]]_, proficient in _whip_.

**Benefit:** When you successfully _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ a creature with your _whip_, you get an immediate extra attack with the _whip_ against another opponent. You cannot take a 5-foot step before making this extra attack. The extra attack is at the same bonus as the attack that tripped the previous creature. You can use this ability once per round. You may use a _whip_ to _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ an opponent closer to you. Make a _trip_ attack as normal. If you win, you _pull_ the target 5 feet closer to you; as a move action you can _pull_ the target even closer (an additional 5 feet for each 5 points by which your check result exceeds the target's check result). The moving defender provokes attacks of opportunity. If you lose, the defender may immediately react and make a Strength check opposed by your Dexterity or Strength check to try to _trip_ you; you may drop the _whip_ to avoid being tripped. You can use this ability to attempt to _snatch_ an object with your _whip_ and _pull_ it toward yourself. If the object is in the _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_ of another creature, make a disarm check. If successful, the item is on the ground in the target's square (the normal result). If you beat their check by 5 or more, the item is on the ground in your square. If you beat their check by 10 or more and you have a free hand, you may automatically catch the item when it enters your square before it lands on the ground.

**Special:** A _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_ may take _[[feats/Serpent Lash|Serpent Lash]]_ as one of his bonus feats.
