# Entreating Critical (Combat, Critical)

Your critical hit allows you a chance to make your foes brief ly see reason.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 15, _[[feats/Call Truce|Call Truce]]_, _[[feats/Critical Focus|Critical Focus]]_, _[[feats/Persuasive|Persuasive]]_, base attack bonus +11, Diplomacy 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** Whenever you confirm a critical hit, the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Shock|shock]]_ of the attack momentarily opens an opportunity to end hostilities with a quick entreaty. As an immediate action immediately after confirming the critical hit, you can attempt a Diplomacy check to improve the target's attitude as though you had spent 1 full round using the _Call Truce_ feat. All other conditions and limitations of the _Call Truce_ feat apply.
