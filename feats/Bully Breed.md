# Bully Breed

Your animal companion can terrify as well as fight.

**Prerequisites:** Handle Animal 4 ranks, Intimidate 4 ranks, animal companion or _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_ class feature.

**Benefit:** Your animal companion or _mount_ gains Intimidate as a class skill. It can attempt to demoralize an opponent using the Intimidate skill as a move action on the same round that it damages an opponent with a natural attack.

**Special:** Your animal companion can select the _[[feats/Dazzling Display|Dazzling Display]]_ and _[[feats/Shatter Defenses|Shatter Defenses]]_ feats if it meets the prerequisites. This feat does not allow your animal companion to use Intimidate to make a target friendly or gain their assistance. Normal: Animal companions and mounts with an Intelligence score of 2 or less must select feats from a limited list.
