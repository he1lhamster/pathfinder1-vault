# Greater Mesmerizing Feint (Combat)

You can feint against nearly any creature.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Mesmerizing Feint|Mesmerizing Feint]]_, Bluff 10 ranks, hypnotic stare class feature, _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ inception bold stare.

**Benefit:** You can feint against mindless creatures at a -4 penalty. Such a creature must be a subject of your hypnotic stare, and the creature has a 50% chance of ignoring the effects of your feint.

**Normal:** Feinting against a creature that is mindless is impossible.
