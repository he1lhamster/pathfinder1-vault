# Stone To Fleshsavant

You can use your mercies to transform _[[conditions/Petrified|petrified]]_ victims back to flesh.

**Prerequisites:** _[[classes/Paladin|Paladin]]_ level 12th, lay on hands class feature, mercy class feature.

**Benefit:** You gain a unique mercy, which aids victims of petrification. Whenever you use your lay on hands ability to _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ damage, you can emulate _[[spells/Stone to Flesh|stone to flesh]]_ on the target, using your _paladin_ level as your caster level. This functions only on a creature that has been _petrified_, and it has no effect on other stone.
