# Scouting Summons (Metamagic)

Your experiments with the connection between summoners and the creatures they _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ have taught you to see through the eyes of a summoned creature for a short time.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Spell Focus|Spell Focus]]_ (conjuration), ability to cast _[[spells/Magic Jar|magic jar]]_.

**Benefit:** When casting a conjuration (summoning) spell that summons a single creature, you can possess the creature as per _magic jar_ (but with no receptacle necessary). If the creature takes damage while you possess it, you must succeed at a concentration check (DC equal to the amount of damage taken) or be ejected from the creature immediately. If the creature takes enough damage to reduce it to 0 hit points or fewer, you are immediately ejected from the creature and take an amount of damage equal to double the level of the spell slot used to _summon_ that creature. A _[[feats/Scouting Summons|scouting summons]]_ spell takes up a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell's actual level.
