# Snatch And Drop (Combat)

You have mastered the ability to _[[universal monster rules/Grab|grab]]_ foes while you fly by them, carry them into the air, and drop them from extreme heights.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Flyby Attack|Flyby Attack]]_, _[[feats/Powerful Wings|Powerful Wings]]_.

**Benefit:** When you succeed at a grapple combat maneuver check as part of a _flyby attack_, you can move yourself and your target up to half your remaining fly speed. You must drop your target before the end of your turn, or both you and your target crash to the ground immediately and take 2d6 points of falling damage each. A dropped creature takes falling damage as normal. You can't use this feat on creatures whose weight would exceed the amount you can carry as a heavy load.
