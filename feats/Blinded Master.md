# Blinded Master (Combat)

Your skill at arms while unable to see is astounding.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Blind-Fight|Blind-Fight]]_, _[[conditions/Blinded|Blinded]]_ Blade Precision, _[[feats/Blinded Blade Style|Blinded Blade Style]]_, Greater Blind-FightAPG, Improved Blind-FightAPG, Perception 15 ranks.

**Benefit:** While you are using _Blinded Blade Style_ and you are _blinded_ or unable to see, your ability to pinpoint creatures' locations using _[[feats/Blinded Competence|Blinded Competence]]_ improves to function like _[[universal monster rules/Blindsight|blindsight]]_ rather than _[[universal monster rules/Blindsense|blindsense]]_, and the range increases to 30 feet. In addition, you add half your character level to the DCs of Bluff checks to feint you in combat.
