# Raging Deathblow

Every killing blow gives you a surge of vitality, further fueling your _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Greater _rage_ class feature.

**Benefit:** While raging, whenever your attack reduces an opponent of a CR greater than or equal to your character level to -1 or fewer hit points, you gain 1 extra round of _rage_ for that day. If that attack was a critical hit, you gain 1 additional extra round of _rage_ for that day. Whenever you rest to renew your total number of rounds of _rage_ per day, any extra rounds you still have from this feat are lost.
