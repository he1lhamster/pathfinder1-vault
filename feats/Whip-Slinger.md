# Whip-Slinger (Combat)

You can use your _[[items/Weapon/Sling|sling]]_ as a _[[items/Weapon/Sap|sap]]_ to make attacks of opportunity.

**Prerequisites:** Proficient with _sling_.

**Benefit:** When wielding a _sling_, double _sling_, or _[[items/Weapon/Halfling _sling_ staff|halfling _sling_ staff]]_, you threaten areas around you as normal and can make attacks of opportunity with the _sling_ into these threatened areas. The _sling_ deals 1d4 nonlethal bludgeoning damage (1d6 for a _[[classes/Medium|Medium]]_ wielder), threatens a critical hit on a 20, and deals x2 damage on a critical hit. If the _sling_ isn't loaded with ammunition when you make an attack of opportunity, you take a -4 penalty on the attack roll.

**Normal:** Slings and double slings are ranged weapons, do not threaten areas, and cannot make attacks of opportunity. A _halfling _sling_ staff_ can be used as a simple melee weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a _[[items/Weapon/Club|club]]_ its size; as a melee weapon, it threatens areas normally and its wielder can make attacks of opportunity with it.
