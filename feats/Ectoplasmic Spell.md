# Ectoplasmic Spell (Metamagic)

Your spells breach the gulf between dimensions, _[[spells/Sending|sending]]_ ghostly emanations into the ether.

**Benefit:** An _[[feats/Ectoplasmic Spell|ectoplasmic spell]]_ has full effect against _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ or ethereal creatures. An _ectoplasmic spell_ uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
