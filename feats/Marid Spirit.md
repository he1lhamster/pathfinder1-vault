While denied your Dexterity bonus to AC you are also denied this _resistance_. Creatures that take cold damage from your _Elemental Fist_ attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modif ier) or become _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_ in ice for 1d4 rounds.
