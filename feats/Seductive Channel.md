# Seductive Channel

Even your healing is seductive.

**Prerequisites:** Channel positive energy class feature, worshiper of Calistria.

**Benefit:** When you channel positive energy, those you _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ can choose to take additional healing equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1), but in return they take a -2 penalty on Will saves against your charms, compulsions, and emotion effects and on Sense Motive checks against your Bluff checks. This penalty lasts for 24 hours. A creature cannot benefit from this feat again for the duration of this penalty.
