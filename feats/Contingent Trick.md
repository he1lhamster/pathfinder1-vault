# Contingent Trick (Trick)

You implant a flexible _[[classes/Mesmerist|mesmerist]]_ trick in the target, triggering the more beneficial trick when the time is right.

**Prerequisites:** Any two trick feats.

**Benefit:** You can implant a _[[feats/Contingent Trick|contingent trick]]_ in a target's mind, following the same rules and limitations for implanting _mesmerist_ tricks. A _contingent trick_ acts as a _mesmerist_ trick in all ways, except that when you are implanting a _contingent trick_, you choose any two _mesmerist_ tricks you know (including masterful tricks) and implant both in your target. You can't choose the same trick twice. When you trigger a _contingent trick_, it acts only as the _mesmerist_ trick that corresponds to the condition you used to trigger the trick.
