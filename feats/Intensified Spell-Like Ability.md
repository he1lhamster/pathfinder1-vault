# Intensified Spell-Like Ability (Monster)

Your spell-like ability deals more damage.

**Prerequisites:** Spell-like ability at caster level 4th or higher.

**Benefit:** Choose one of your _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as an _[[feats/Intensified Spell-Like Ability|intensified spell-like ability]]_ three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). When you use an _intensified spell-like ability_, the maximum number of the ability's damage dice increases by 5 levels. You must have sufficient caster levels to surpass the normal maximum in order to benefit from this feat. No other variables of the spell-like ability are affected, and _spell-like abilities_ that inflict damage that is not modified by caster level are not affected by this feat. You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 1. For a summary, see Table 3-1.

**Special:** This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.
