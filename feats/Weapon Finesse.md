# Weapon Finesse (Combat)

You are trained in using your agility in melee combat, as opposed to brute strength.

**Benefit:** With a light weapon, _[[items/Weapon/Elven curve blade|elven curve blade]]_, _[[items/Weapon/Rapier|rapier]]_, _[[items/Weapon/Whip|whip]]_, or _[[items/Weapon/Spiked chain|spiked chain]]_ made for a creature of your size category, you may use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls. If you carry a _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_, its armor check penalty applies to your attack rolls.

**Special:** Natural weapons are considered light weapons.
