# Area Jinx

You can jinx multiple creatures so long as they are near each other.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Widen Spell|Widen Spell]]_, Halfling Jinx trait.

**Benefit:** When you use your jinx, you create an instantaneous _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ burst with a maximum radius of 10 feet anywhere within the normal range of your jinx, affecting multiple targets. Any creature within this burst, regardless of whether or not you can see it, must make a saving throw to resist your jinx. If you use your jinx again, all of your current jinxes immediately end.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you do, the maximum area of your jinx burst increases by an additional 10 feet.
