# Blood Salvage

You do not need to drink blood from a living creature to gain healing benefits.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Blood Drinker|Blood Drinker]]_, _[[monsters/Dhampir|dhampir]]_.

**Benefit:** You can use your _Blood Drinker_ feat on a dead creature of the appropriate humanoid subtype. The creature must have died less than 6 hours beforehand.

**Normal:** You only benefit from the _Blood Drinker_ feat if you consume fresh blood from a living creature.
