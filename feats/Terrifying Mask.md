# Terrifying Mask

Your fiendish visage has made you a truly terrifying spectacle to behold, and you can force others to betray their feelings with a single look.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, _[[feats/Monstrous Mask|Monstrous Mask]]_, _[[monsters/Tiefling|tiefling]]_.

**Benefit:** Anytime you can make a Sense Motive check to get a hunch or detect whether someone is trustworthy or not, you can choose to instead make an Intimidate check at a -2 penalty. This ability only works on creatures of the humanoid type.
