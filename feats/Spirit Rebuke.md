# Spirit Rebuke

Your insight and force of will can tame dangerous spirits.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 17; _[[feats/Iron Will|Iron Will]]_; _[[feats/Spirit Beacon|Spirit Beacon]]_; Diplomacy 5 ranks or Intimidate 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** Select one specific category of spirit (fey, outsiders, or undead). Once per day as a standard action, you can condemn these spirits with such force of will that you can drive them from hosts, unravel their magic, or damage them physically. A _[[spells/Rebuke|rebuke]]_ targets a single spirit you can see (or one that is possessing a creature you can see) within 30 feet. Rebuking a spirit either functions as a targeted _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ spell or channels damaging energy directly into the creature, similar to a _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_'s channel energy ability. To dispel a spirit's magic, attempt a dispel check, using your character level as your caster level (DC = 11 + spell level); if you're successful, that effect is dispelled. You can dispel only spells and _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ affecting the spirit itself or a creature it is currently possessing. If you use this dispel effect to end a spirit's _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_ of a creature or object, you gain a +2 bonus on this check. _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Channeling|Channeling]]_ damaging energy instead deals 1d6 points of damage for every 2 character levels you have. A successful Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Charisma modifier) halves this damage.

**Special:** You can select this feat up to three times. Each time you do, you must select a different category of spirit your _rebuke_ can affect, and you can use the feat one additional time each day.
