# Elephant Stomp (Combat)

You deliver a _[[feats/Crushing Blow|crushing blow]]_ to downed enemies.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, _[[feats/Improved Overrun|Improved Overrun]]_, base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** When you overrun an opponent and your maneuver check exceeds your opponent's CMD by 5 or more, instead of moving through your opponent's space and knocking her _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_, you may stop in the space directly in front of the opponent (or the nearest adjacent space) and make one attack with an unarmed strike or a natural weapon against that opponent as an immediate action.

**Normal:** When your overrun maneuver check exceeds your opponent's CMD by 5 or more, you move through the target's space and she is knocked _prone_.
