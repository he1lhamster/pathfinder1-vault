# Quiet Death (Combat)

You have learned to dispatch your enemies with the _[[spells/Silence|silence]]_ and _[[spells/Grace|grace]]_ of an accomplished assassin.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 19, Stealth 10 ranks, _[[classes/Rogue|rogue]]_ level 10th.

**Benefit:** When you ambush an enemy or enemies that are unaware of your presence, you can roll a Stealth check with a -5 penalty. The result indicates the Perception DC to hear your attacks (rather than the normal DC of -10 to hear pitched combat) until an opponent's first action, when the DC returns to -10. Other enemies present can still see the attack; _[[feats/Quiet Death|Quiet Death]]_ only prevents the sounds of battle from alerting further enemies.
