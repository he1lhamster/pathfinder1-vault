# Dervish Dance (Combat)

You have learned to turn your speed into power, even with a heavier blade.

**Prerequisites:** Dexterity 13, _[[feats/Weapon Finesse|Weapon Finesse]]_, Perform (dance) 2 ranks, proficient with _[[items/Weapon/Scimitar|scimitar]]_.

**Benefit:** When wielding a _scimitar_ with one hand, you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on melee attack and damage rolls. You treat the _scimitar_ as a one-handed piercing weapon for all feats and class abilities that require such a weapon (such as a duelist's _[[feats/Precise Strike|precise strike]]_ ability). The _scimitar_ must be for a creature of your size. You cannot use this feat if you are carrying a weapon or _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ in your off hand.
