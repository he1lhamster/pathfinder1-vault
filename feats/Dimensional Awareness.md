# Dimensional Awareness (Combat)

Your exposure to summoned creatures allows you to predict where conjured opponents will likely appear.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Arcane Strike|Arcane Strike]]_ or _[[feats/Disruptive|Disruptive]]_; _[[feats/Banishing Critical|Banishing Critical]]_; _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_; Spellcraft 8 ranks; arcane pool class feature.

**Benefit:** If a summoned or called creature materializes in a space you threaten, you can make an attack of opportunity against that creature before it acts, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus on the attack roll if you successfully identified the spell used to _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ or call that creature.

**Normal:** A summoned or _called_ creature appears instantly when the spell used to conjure it is completed, allowing for no attack of opportunity against the creature.
