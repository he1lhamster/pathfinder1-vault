# Cloven Helm (Combat)

Your helm turns aside lethal blows.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Dented Helm|Dented Helm]]_, _[[feats/Hard-Headed|Hard-Headed]]_, base attack bonus +11, dwarf.

**Benefit:** When wearing a helmet, you add +1 to your AC against critical hit confirmation rolls; this benefit stacks with _Dented Helm_. When you use _Dented Helm_ to def lect a critical hit, you may apply all damage from the critical hit to your helmet before applying any damage to yourself. If you take no damage, any additional effects, such as critical feats or poison, are negated.
