# Unfettered Rage

When no allies are nearby, you can safely unleash the full extent of your fury.

**Prerequisites:** _[[spells/Rage|Rage]]_ class feature, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** While raging, when you make a full attack with a melee weapon, you can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ an extra round of _rage_ and make one additional attack at your highest base attack bonus, taking a -2 penalty on all of your attacks and a -2 penalty to your AC until your next turn. You cannot use this ability if there are any allies within 5 feet of you or of any squares you threaten. This benefit does not stack with similar effects, such as _[[spells/Haste|haste]]_.
