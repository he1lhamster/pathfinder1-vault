# Searing Distraction (Combat)

You harry your foes with the light and _[[universal monster rules/Heat|heat]]_ of your weapon.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Catch Off-Guard|Catch Off-Guard]]_.

**Benefit:** When you make an attack using a light source such as a _[[items/Mundane/Sunrod|sunrod]]_ or _[[items/Mundane/Torch|torch]]_ as an improvised weapon, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be _[[conditions/Dazzled|dazzled]]_ for 1 round. On a critical hit, the target is instead _[[conditions/Blinded|blinded]]_ for 1 round. The DC of the effect is 10 + half your character level + your Dexterity modifier. Blind targets are immune to this effect.
