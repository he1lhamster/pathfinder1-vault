# Elemental Overload

As you become suffused with power, you become more and more like an elemental.

**Prerequisites:** Elemental overflow class feature, _[[classes/Kineticist|kineticist]]_ level 15th.

**Benefit:** Whenever you have accepted at least 4 points of _[[universal monster rules/Burn|burn]]_, the chance to ignore the effects of a critical hit or sneak attack increases by an additional 10%. This chance increases by an additional 5% for every 2 points of _burn_ you accept after that. This chance can't exceed 100%.

**Normal:** Whenever you have accepted at least 3 points of _burn_, your chance to ignore the effects of a critical hit or sneak attack equals 5% x your current number of points of _burn_.
