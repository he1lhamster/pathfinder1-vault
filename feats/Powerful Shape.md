# Powerful Shape

Your wild shapes are mighty and muscular.

**Prerequisites:** Wild shape class feature, _[[classes/Druid|druid]]_ level 8th.

**Benefit:** When in wild shape, treat your size as one category larger for the purpose of calculating CMB, CMD, carrying capacity, and any size-based special attacks you use or that are used against you (such as _[[universal monster rules/Grab|grab]]_, _[[universal monster rules/Swallow Whole|swallow whole]]_, and _[[universal monster rules/Trample|trample]]_).
