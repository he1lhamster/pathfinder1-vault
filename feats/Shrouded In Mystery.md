# Shrouded In Mystery

Common folk have many superstitious rumors about your kind-tall tales born out of ignorance and _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ alike. Whether or not what they say about your race is true is irrelevant, as you use their beliefs to take advantage of them whenever you can.

**Prerequisites:** Bluff 1 rank; Disguise 1 rank; _[[monsters/Kitsune|kitsune]]_, _[[monsters/Nagaji|nagaji]]_, _[[monsters/Samsaran|samsaran]]_, _[[monsters/Tengu|tengu]]_, or _[[monsters/Wayang|wayang]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 insight bonus on Will saves against mind-affecting spells and effects and a +3 insight bonus on Bluff checks. Both benefits apply only against humanoid creatures of races other than your own.
