# Fearsome Spell-Like Ability (Monster)

Your spell-like ability induces _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ in affected targets.

**Prerequisites:** Spell-like ability at caster level 6th or higher.

**Benefit:** Choose one of your _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a _[[feats/Fearsome Spell-Like Ability|fearsome spell-like ability]]_ three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). When a target takes damage from a _fearsome spell-like ability_ and fails its saving throw against the spell-like ability, it becomes _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for a number of rounds equal to the spell-like ability's equivalent spell level. If the spell-like ability doesn't allow a saving throw, creatures harmed by it can attempt a Will save (against the DC that the spell-like ability would have if it allowed a saving throw) to negate the _shaken_ effect. If the effect of the spell-like ability also causes targets to become _shaken_ and a target fails its saving throw, the duration of the _shaken_ condition caused by this effect stacks with the spell-like ability's. A _fearsome spell-like ability_ can't cause a creature to become _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_, even if that creature is already _shaken_. You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 2. For a summary, see Table 3-1.

**Special:** This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.
