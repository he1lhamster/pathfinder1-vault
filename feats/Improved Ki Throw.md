# Improved Ki Throw (Combat)

Your enemies are living weapons in your hands.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Bull Rush|Improved Bull Rush]]_, _[[feats/Ki Throw|Ki Throw]]_.

**Benefit:** When using the _Ki Throw_ feat, you may throw your target into any square you threaten that is occupied by another creature. Make a bull rush combat maneuver check with a -4 penalty against the secondary target. If this check succeeds, the thrown creature lands _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ in the secondary target's square, while the secondary target is pushed back and knocked _prone_ in an adjacent square. If the check fails, the thrown creature lands _prone_ in the nearest square you threaten adjacent to the secondary target. If you throw a Large or larger creature into an area containing multiple secondary targets, you take an additional penalty of -4 on your combat maneuver check for each target after the first.

**Special:** A _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ may take this as a bonus feat at 14th level.
