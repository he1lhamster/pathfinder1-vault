# Elven Spirit

Although you are of mixed heritage, you are closer to your elven relatives and the magic in their blood flows freely in your veins.

**Prerequisites:** Half-elf.

**Benefit:** You possess the elven magic racial trait of the elves, granting you a +2 racial bonus on caster level checks made to overcome _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_. In addition, you receive a +2 racial bonus on Spellcraft checks made to _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ the properties of magic items. Alternatively, you can instead gain any one racial trait that elves can exchange for the elven magic racial trait.

**Special:** You can only take this feat at 1st level. If you take this feat, you cannot take the _[[feats/Human Spirit|Human Spirit]]_ feat.
