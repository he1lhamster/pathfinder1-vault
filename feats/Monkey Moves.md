# Monkey Moves (Combat)

You scramble around your foes, moving and striking in an erratic fashion.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 13, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Monkey Style|Monkey Style]]_, Acrobatics 8 ranks, Climb 8 ranks.

**Benefit:** While using _Monkey Style_, you gain a Wisdom bonus on _Climb_ checks. You can also can _climb_ and crawl at half your speed; you can take a 5-foot step by jumping, crawling, or climbing; and you retain your Dexterity bonus to AC while climbing. Further, while using _Monkey Style_, when you use your unarmed strike to hit an opponent twice or more on your turn, you can spend a swift action to take a 5-foot step even if you have moved this round.

**Normal:** You _climb_ at one-quarter your speed, and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC while doing so. A 5-foot step is made using your normal movement modes, and you can take one only if you have not otherwise moved this round.
