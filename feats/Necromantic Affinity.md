# Necromantic Affinity

Long exposure to necromantic energies has granted you a small measure of _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ against them.

**Prerequisites:** Con 15.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws made to resist spells and effects that utilize negative energy, cause negative levels, or cause ability damage, ability drain, or ability penalties. In addition, damage caused by inflict spells heals you as if you were an undead creature, but you also take damage from cure spells.
