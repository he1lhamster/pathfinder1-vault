# Shoki's Argument

The collectors of the lost dead prefer to use complex theology or blunt warnings to gather wayward spirits, but sometimes a more direct approach is necessary. One of them shared a trade secret with you.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to cast _[[spells/Disrupt Undead|disrupt undead]]_, character level 3rd, _[[monsters/Duskwalker|duskwalker]]_.

**Benefit:** The damage dealt by your _disrupt undead_ spell increases by 1d6. It increases by an additional 1d6 at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 7d6 at 18th level).
