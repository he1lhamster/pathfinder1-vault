# Stretched Wings

You strengthen your crippled wings.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Skill Focus|Skill Focus]]_ (Fly), _[[monsters/Strix|strix]]_, wing-clipped racial trait.

**Benefit:** Your _strix_ racial fly speed increases to 60 feet (average). You ignore the wing-clipped trait's Fly check requirement to fly upward.
