# Sympathetic Rage (Combat)

Seeing an ally _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ fills you with your own fury.

**Prerequisites:** Half-orc or _[[monsters/Orc|orc]]_, nonlawful.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who is raging, you may choose to enter a similar but less powerful _rage_ as a free action on your turn. This weaker _rage_ gives you all the benefits and penalties of a _[[classes/Barbarian|barbarian]]_'s _rage_, except your morale bonus to Strength and Constitution is only +2. There is no limit to how long you can _rage_, as long as you remain adjacent to a raging ally (for example, you could take a 5-foot step away from one raging ally toward another raging ally and maintain your _rage_). As with a _barbarian_'s _rage_, when this weaker _rage_ ends, you are _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_. You cannot use this feat if you are _fatigued_.
