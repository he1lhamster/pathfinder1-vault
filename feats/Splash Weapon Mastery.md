# Splash Weapon Mastery

You are adept at increasing the range, area, and accuracy of splash weapons.

**Benefit:** When _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Throwing|throwing]]_ a splash weapon, you act as if you had the _[[feats/Far Shot|Far Shot]]_ feat. When you hit with a splash weapon, select one additional square adjacent to the splash area; creatures in this area also take splash damage. When you miss with a splash weapon, you may adjust the miss direction on the grid by +1 or -1. This feat counts as _Far Shot_ for the purpose of qualifying for other feats, but only in regard to splash weapons.
