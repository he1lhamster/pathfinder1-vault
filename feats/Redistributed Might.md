# Redistributed Might (Combat)

You've gained enough control over your body to translate strength into swiftness.

**Prerequisites:** Con 13 or Wis 13, Enhanced Morale, _[[feats/Exotic Weapon Proficiency|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]]_ (_[[items/Weapon/Aldori _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Dueling|dueling]]_ sword|Aldori _dueling_ sword]]_), _[[feats/Iron Will|Iron Will]]_, base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit:** Whenever an effect would grant you an enhancement or morale bonus to your Strength score (such as via _[[spells/Bull's Strength|bull's strength]]_ or a _[[classes/Skald|skald]]_'s _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Inspired|inspired]]_ rageACG performance), you can instead apply that bonus to your Dexterity score. You make this choice when you first gain the bonus. The bonus type does not change.
