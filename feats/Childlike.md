# Childlike

Your resemblance to a human child tends to make others trust you, perhaps more than they should.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, halfling.

**Benefit:** You can take 10 on Bluff checks to convince others you are telling the truth, so long as your story makes you appear innocent. You gain a +2 bonus on Disguise skill checks to pose as a human child, and ignore the check penalties for disguising yourself as a different race and age category while doing so.
