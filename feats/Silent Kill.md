# Silent Kill (Combat)

You are quite adept at killing your prey without making noise or alerting others.

**Prerequisites:** Stealth 12 ranks; assassinate advanced _[[classes/Slayer|slayer]]_ talent or _[[classes/Ninja|ninja]]_ master trick.

**Benefit:** When you kill a creature during a surprise round, you can attempt a Stealth check, opposed by the Perception checks of potential observers, to prevent them from noticing your action and subsequently identifying you as the assailant.
