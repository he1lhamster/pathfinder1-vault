# Nemesis (Story)

A past enemy seeks your ruin.

**Prerequisites:** You must have at least one enemy who wishes to cause you great _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_. If you have multiple enemies, the GM may keep the specific _[[feats/Nemesis|nemesis]]_ secret, or have many of your enemies work together against you. If your _nemesis_ is not already a challenging foe, it either advances in strength to become a challenging foe or allies with others to achieve a higher challenge rating.

**Benefit:** Having a _nemesis_ drives you to excel in _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_. For each new level you gain in a favored class, including the level you gained when you chose this feat, you can choose two benefits instead of one. One of these benefits must be either a bonus hit point or a bonus skill point, even if other options are available.

**Goal:** Slay your _nemesis_. Causing your _nemesis_'s death through your direct actions qualifies even if you do not strike the fatal blow, but another killing your _nemesis_ without your involvement doesn't count.

**Completion Benefit:** You gain a +2 inherent bonus to an ability score of your choice. In addition, you may retroactively apply your extra favored class benefit to the favored class levels you gained before taking this feat.

**Special:** Thwarting your plans becomes an all-consuming goal for your _nemesis_. Your _nemesis_ gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against you. Whatever you try to achieve, your _nemesis_ seeks to tear down.
