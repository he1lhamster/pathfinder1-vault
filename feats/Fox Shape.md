# Fox Shape

You can change into a fox in addition to your other forms.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, base attack bonus +3, _[[monsters/Kitsune|kitsune]]_.

**Benefit:** You can take the form of a fox (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 112) whose appearance is static and cannot be changed each time you assume this form. Your bite attack's damage is reduced to 1d3 points of damage on a hit, but you gain a +10 racial bonus on Disguise checks made to appear as a fox. Changing from _kitsune_ to _[[feats/Fox Shape|fox shape]]_ is a standard action. This ability otherwise functions as _[[spells/Beast Shape II|beast shape II]]_, and your ability scores change accordingly.
