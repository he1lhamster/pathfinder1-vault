# Extreme Prejudice (Combat)

Your hatred of a particular type of creature has honed your killer instinct.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Seething Hatred|Seething Hatred]]_, sneak attack +3d6, studied target class feature.

**Benefit:** When you succeed at a sneak attack against a creature you selected as the target of your _Seething Hatred_ feat, you use d8s to roll sneak attack damage instead of d6s.
