# Sense Magical Interrogation

You have developed an uncanny sixth sense for detecting when your words are subject to magical scrutiny.

**Prerequisites:** Sense Motive 3 ranks, Spellcraft 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are subject to a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability that can discern whether or not you are telling the truth, you are automatically aware of such magic. You are not immune to such spells or abilities, but you can choose to remain silent or avoid _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Answering|answering]]_ questions. If you concentrate as a full-round action, you detect the source of the spell or ability and can attempt a Spellcraft check to determine the exact spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability being used (DC = 15 + the spell level, or 15 + 1/2 the caster level for a non-spell effect).
