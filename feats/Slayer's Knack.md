# Slayer's Knack

You know how to battle your favored enemies with such efficacy that any weapon you wield against them becomes more _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Favored enemy class feature, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** When you take this feat, choose one of your favored enemy types. Against enemies of that type, the threat range of any weapon you wield is doubled. This effect does not stack with any other effect that expands a weapon's threat range.

**Special:** You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you take it, you choose a different favored enemy type.
