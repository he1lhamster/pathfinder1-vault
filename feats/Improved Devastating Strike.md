# Improved Devastating Strike (Combat)

The fury and power channeled through your attack is enough to kill a lesser being outright.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Devastating Strike|Devastating Strike]]_, _[[feats/Vital Strike|Vital Strike]]_, base attack bonus +13.

**Benefit:** Whenever you use _Vital Strike_, _[[feats/Improved Vital Strike|Improved Vital Strike]]_, or _[[feats/Greater Vital Strike|Greater Vital Strike]]_, you gain a bonus on attack rolls to confirm a critical hit equal to the bonus on damage rolls you gain from _Devastating Strike_.
