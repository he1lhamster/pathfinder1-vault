# Deflect Arrows (Combat)

You can _[[spells/Knock|knock]]_ arrows and other projectiles off course, preventing them from hitting you.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_.

**Benefit:** You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with an attack from a ranged weapon, you may def lect it so that you take no damage from it. You must be aware of the attack and not _[[conditions/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]_. Attempting to def lect a ranged attack doesn't count as an action. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by _[[universal monster rules/Natural Attacks|natural attacks]]_ or spell effects can't be def lected.
