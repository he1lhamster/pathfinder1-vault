# Targeted Blow

You can inflict special injuries on your foes by attacking specific areas.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, base attack bonus +9, weapon _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ class feature with a melee weapon.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can make a single melee attack with an appropriate weapon while targeting a specific body part of your foe. On a successful attack, you affect the target as if you had used the targetingUC _[[classes/Gunslinger|gunslinger]]_ deed. You can use this ability two times per day, plus one additional time per day when your base attack bonus reaches +10, +15, and +20.
