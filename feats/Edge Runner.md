# Edge Runner

You move with speed and assurance in places that cause others to fall into danger.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13.

**Benefit:** You can move at full speed while using Acrobatics to balance on narrow surfaces, and do not become _[[conditions/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]_ or lose your Dexterity bonus to AC while doing so. You also gain a +4 bonus on Climb checks to catch yourself while falling. You also gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against effects that would cause you to fall into a pit (such as _[[spells/Create Pit|create pit]]_ or a pit trap). This bonus does not apply to your CMD against bull rush or _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ attacks.
