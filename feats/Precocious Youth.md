# Precocious Youth

Even in youth, you seek to be more adult than your childish peers, a personal trait that will no doubt aid you in future years.

**Prerequisites:** Young age category.

**Benefit:** You lose one of the penalties associated with the young age category, either -2 Constitution, -2 Strength, or -2 Wisdom. Upon reaching adulthood you may exchange this feat for _[[feats/Great Fortitude|Great Fortitude]]_, _[[feats/Iron Will|Iron Will]]_, or _[[feats/Lightning Reflexes|Lightning Reflexes]]_.

**Special:** You may take this feat up to three times. Each time you do, it affects a different penalty and must be exchanged for a different feat upon reaching adulthood.
