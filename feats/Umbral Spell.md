# Umbral Spell (Metamagic)

Targets of your _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_ spells radiate _darkness_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Tenebrous Spell|Tenebrous Spell]]_.

**Benefit:** An _[[feats/Umbral Spell|umbral spell]]_ gains the _darkness_ descriptor. As long as the spell is in effect, the creature or object affected radiates _darkness_ in a 10-foot radius, reducing illumination similar to the effects of the _darkness_ spell. Nonmagical sources of light, such as torches or lanterns, do not increase the light level in this area. Magical light sources only increase the light level in an area affected by an _umbral spell_ if they are of a higher level than the _umbral spell_'s unmodified spell level. This effect does not stack with itself or with any other effect that creates _darkness_. An _umbral spell_ uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level. You cannot use this feat on a spell with an instantaneous duration or a spell that does not target a creature or object.
