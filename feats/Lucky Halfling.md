# Lucky Halfling

You bring luck to those with whom you travel.

**Prerequisites:** Halfling.

**Benefit:** Once per day, when one of your allies within 30 feet makes a saving throw, you may roll the same saving throw as if you were the one subject to the effect requiring it. You may use this ability after your ally has rolled, but before the GM declares if the roll was a success or failure. Your ally may choose to use your saving throw in place of his own.
