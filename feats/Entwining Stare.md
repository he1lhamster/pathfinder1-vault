# Entwining Stare (Stare)

Your painful stare makes your enemies easier to _[[universal monster rules/Grab|grab]]_ and _[[universal monster rules/Constrict|constrict]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[classes/Mesmerist|Mesmerist]]_ level 7th, painful stare class feature.

**Benefit:** When you trigger your painful stare to add damage to an attack with _grab_, the target takes a -4 penalty to its CMD against the _grab_'s grapple combat maneuver attempt.
