# Fiendish Facade

You are easily mistaken for a member of another race. Your fiendish physical traits are normally hidden by clothing or appear to be markings of another race.

**Prerequisites:** Must be taken at 1st level, _[[monsters/Tiefling|tiefling]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain a +5 racial bonus on Disguise checks when attempting to impersonate a particular race. You must select the race you are able to impersonate when you select this feat, and thereafter you cannot change the race you have chosen. That race must be _[[classes/Medium|Medium]]_ size.
