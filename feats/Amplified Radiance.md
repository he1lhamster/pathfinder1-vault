# Amplified Radiance (Teamwork)

The vicinity of another of your kind ignites your _[[feats/Inner Light|inner light]]_ into a shining aurora.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Aasimar|Aasimar]]_, _[[spells/Daylight|daylight]]_ racial spell-like ability.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are within 15 feet of an _aasimar_ ally who has both the _daylight_ racial spell-like ability and this feat, you gain an aura of _[[items/Weapon/Radiance|radiance]]_. You and your ally must both have at least one use of your _daylight_ racial spell-like ability available to gain this benefit. This aura functions as per the _daylight_ spell, except that it's a 10-foot-radius emanation centered on you without additional areas of weaker illumination. Creatures within this aura who take penalties in bright light double those penalties. The effects of overlapping auras of _radiance_ don't stack. You can activate or suppress this aura as a swift action.
