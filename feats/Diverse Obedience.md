# Diverse Obedience

Your intense faith in your deity allows you to gain boons not granted to most followers.

**Prerequisites:** Deific ObedienceISG, Knowledge (religion) 5 ranks, alignment must match that of your worshiped deity.

**Benefit:** You are treated as though you had 2 more Hit Dice than you actually do for the purposes of determining what divine boons you gain as a result of performing your deity's obedience. _[[feats/Diverse Obedience|Diverse Obedience]]_ doesn't allow access to divine boons granted through prestige classes early, as those boons are tied to prestige class levels gained, not overall Hit Dice. If you take levels in a prestige class or archetype that offers accelerated access to a boon, this benefit may be superf luous. Additionally, whenever you would gain a boon as a result of your _[[feats/Deific Obedience|Deific Obedience]]_ feat (and not through a prestige class), you can choose among the options available for evangelist, exalted, or sentinel boons. Once you make the selection, it is permanent, but you can choose from a different category each time you gain a new boon as you increase your Hit Dice.
