# Expanded Hunter Tactics (Combat)

You're able to train your allies as you do your animal companion.

**Prerequisites:** _[[classes/Hunter|Hunter]]_ tacticsACG class feature.

**Benefit:** As a move action, you can grant a teamwork feat you know to a single ally within 30 feet who can see and hear you. The selected ally gains the benefits of this bonus feat for 1 round plus 1 additional round for every 2 character levels you have, but only while the ally is adjacent to you or your animal companion. A given ally can benefit from this feat only once per day.
