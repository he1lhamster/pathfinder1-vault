# Death or Glory (Combat)

Even when facing a larger foe, you aren't afraid to take great risks in order to finish the fight.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** Against a creature of size Large or larger, you can make a single melee attack as a full-round action, gaining a +4 bonus on the attack roll, damage roll, and critical confirmation roll. You gain an additional +1 on this bonus at base attack bonus +11, +16, and +20 (for a maximum of +7 at base attack +20). After you resolve your attack, the opponent you attack can spend an immediate action to make a single melee attack against you with the same bonuses.

**Special:** You can combine the full-round action attack this feat allows with the benefit of _[[feats/Vital Strike|Vital Strike]]_, _[[feats/Improved Vital Strike|Improved Vital Strike]]_, or _[[feats/Greater Vital Strike|Greater Vital Strike]]_.
