# Seeking Spell (Metamagic)

You can cast spells that bend around barriers to reach their intended destination.

**Benefit:** A _[[feats/Seeking Spell|seeking spell]]_'s range can bend around obstacles to reach the intended target. You can define the route yourself or unambiguously _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ a target and allow the spell to determine its own path. However, the spell fails if it would have to travel farther than its maximum range to reach the identified target. A ranged attack roll made to deliver a _seeking spell_ is not subject to cover or concealment. In order to benefit from this feat, the selected spell must have a range greater than touch and target one or more creatures, or it must require the caster to make a ranged touch attack. A _seeking spell_ uses up a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell's actual level.
