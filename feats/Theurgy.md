# Theurgy

You can _[[spells/Blend|blend]]_ the power of arcane and divine magic.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 13, Int or Cha 13, able to cast 1st-level arcane spells, able to cast 1st-level divine spells.

**Benefit:** You can augment the power of your divine spells with arcane energy and augment your arcane spells with divine energy. When casting a divine spell, you may _[[spells/Sacrifice|sacrifice]]_ an arcane spell slot or arcane prepared spell of that spell's level or higher as a swift action. The caster level for that divine spell increases by +1. When casting an arcane spell, you may _sacrifice_ a divine spell slot or prepared divine spell of the same or higher level as a swift action. Half the damage dealt by the arcane spell becomes holy (if you channel positive energy) or _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Unholy|unholy]]_ (if you channel negative energy).
