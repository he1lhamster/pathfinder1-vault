# Punch Through (Combat, Teamwork)

You and your allies are adept at bypassing enemy defenses.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** As a full-round action, you may make a single attack against a target. If the attack hits and deals damage to the target, all of your allies with this feat ignore up to 5 points of _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_ against the same target for 1 round. This feat does not apply to _damage reduction_ without a type (such as DR 10/-).
