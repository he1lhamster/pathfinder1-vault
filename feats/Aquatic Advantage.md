# Aquatic Advantage

Foes without a swim speed provoke attacks of opportunity from you _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_, must have a natural swim speed.

**Benefit:** A creature that lacks a swim speed provokes an attack of opportunity from you when it attacks you _underwater_. You don't get an attack of opportunity if the attacker is under the effects of _[[spells/Freedom of Movement|freedom of movement]]_.
