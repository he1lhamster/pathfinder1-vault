# Greater Flyby Attack (Monster)

The creature can make an attack against each opponent before and after it moves while flying.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, Fly speed, _[[feats/Flyby Attack|Flyby Attack]]_, base attack bonus +8

**Benefit:** When making a _flyby attack_ and flying in a straight line, the creature can make a single attack at its highest attack bonus against each opponent within reach at any point during the move. The creature makes a separate attack roll against each opponent, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity from a targeted opponent.

**Normal:** Without this feat, the creature makes a single attack during a _flyby attack_.
