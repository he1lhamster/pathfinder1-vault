# Boon Companion

Your bond with your animal companion or familiar is unusually close.

**Prerequisites:** Animal companion or familiar class feature.

**Benefit:** The abilities of your animal companion or familiar are calculated as though your class were 4 levels higher, to a maximum effective _[[classes/Druid|druid]]_ level equal to your character level. If you have more than one animal companion or familiar, choose one to receive this benefit. If you lose or dismiss an animal companion or familiar that has received this benefit, you may apply this feat to the replacement creature.

**Special:** You may select this feat more than once. The effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a different animal companion or familiar.
