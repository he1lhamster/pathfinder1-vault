# Traumatic Spell (Metamagic)

Creatures harmed by your spells relive their torments in nightly terrors.

**Benefit:** A _[[feats/Traumatic Spell|traumatic spell]]_ causes lingering memories of pain and suffering in creatures harmed by it. When a creature fails a saving throw against a _traumatic spell_, the next time it sleeps it must succeed at a Will save with a DC equal to the original spell's DC or be affected as if by _[[spells/Nightmare|nightmare]]_. Each time the target fails its save, it must save again the following night or be affected by another _nightmare_, though the save DC decreases by 2 each night after the first. This metamagic feat can be applied only to spells with the emotion or _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ descriptor. A _traumatic spell_ uses up a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell's actual level.
