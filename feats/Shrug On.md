# Shrug On (Combat)

You can throw on the most important element of your armor in a flash.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +1, _[[feats/Medium Armor Proficiency|medium armor proficiency]]_.

**Benefit:** As a full-round action, you can shrug yourself into the largest and most protective section of a suit of armor with which you are proficient. The armor does not grant any magical benefits in this state, and its armor check penalty and maximum Dexterity bonus to AC are both 2 worse than normal. When donned using this feat, _[[classes/Medium|medium]]_ armor grants a +3 armor bonus, and heavy armor grants a +5 armor bonus. Light armor grants no armor bonus when donned using this feat.
