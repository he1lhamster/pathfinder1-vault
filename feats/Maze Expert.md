# Maze Expert

You have a near-perfect sense of direction.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Skill Focus|Skill Focus]]_ (Survival), Survival 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** You gain a +4 bonus on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost and to determine whether you are lost. You also gain a +4 bonus on Intelligence checks to navigate mazes, including to escape a _[[spells/Maze|maze]]_ spell. Once per day, you can use your intuition to determine whether traveling a particular direction from a fork in the road (or other junction) might be productive or dangerous. This functions like the _[[spells/Augury|augury]]_ spell, except it provides weal or woe based on traveling in a particular direction.
