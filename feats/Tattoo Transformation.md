# Tattoo Transformation

You've learned to take on some of the _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ of a summoned creature when you absorb it as a _[[items/Mundane/Tattoo|tattoo]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Inscribe Magical TattooISM or Varisian TattooISWG; _[[feats/Tattoo Attunement|Tattoo Attunement]]_; Spellcraft 9 ranks.

**Benefit:** When you use _Tattoo Attunement_ on a creature you've summoned, you can gain that creature's elemental _resistance_ as long as it is in _tattoo_ form. If the creature has _resistance_ to multiple elemental types, you gain only one of them. If the creature is immune to an elemental type, you gain _resistance_ 20 to that type. For example, if the creature has _resistance_ 10 to both fire and cold and _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to electricity, you can gain _resistance_ 10 to either fire or cold or _resistance_ 20 to electricity as long as the creature is in _tattoo_ form.
