# Murky Spell (Metamagic)

You can call upon murky sediments in the water to transform a mist spell _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_.

**Benefit:** You can apply _[[feats/Murky Spell|Murky Spell]]_ only to a mist or fog spell that normally doesn't work _underwater_, such as _[[spells/Cloudkill|cloudkill]]_, _[[spells/Fog Cloud|fog cloud]]_, _[[spells/Mind Fog|mind fog]]_, _[[spells/Obscuring Mist|obscuring mist]]_, or _[[spells/Solid Fog|solid fog]]_. When cast _underwater_, a _murky spell_ clouds the water with sediments, producing roughly the same effects as the normal spell would above water except as follows. Due to the dilution, a _murky spell_ has only one-tenth of the duration of a normal spell (generally 1 minute per level, though _mind fog_ lasts 3 minutes), but this reduction doesn't affect the duration of secondary effects like _mind fog_'s mental penalties. Abilities that see through mist and fog can't see through a _murky spell_ unless they also specifically see through murky water (like the _[[universal monster rules/Mistsight|mistsight]]_ universal monster rule). Instead of wind, currents can disperse a _murky spell_; any current with a speed of at least 10 feet disperses a _murky spell_ in 1 round. A _murky spell_ has no effect above the water. A _murky spell_ uses up a slot the same spell level as the spell's actual level.
