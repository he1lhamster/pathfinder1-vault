# Extended Scrying

Your _[[spells/Scrying|scrying]]_ spells last longer.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to cast a spell of the _scrying_ subschool.

**Benefit:** Any _scrying_ spell you cast lasts twice as long as normal, as if it were cast as an extended spell with the _[[feats/Extend Spell|Extend Spell]]_ metamagic feat. Additionally, when you cast a _scrying_ spell with a casting time of 10 minutes or longer, that casting time is halved.
