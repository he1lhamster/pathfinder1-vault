# Battle Cry (Combat)

Your _[[spells/Shout|shout]]_ heartens your allies and encourages them in the fight.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13; base attack bonus +5 or Perform (act, oratory, or sing) 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** A number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus, you can let out a _[[feats/Battle Cry|battle cry]]_ as a swift action. When you do, allies within 30 feet who can hear you gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_. This effect lasts for 1 minute. If an ally is under the effect of this feat and fails a saving throw against a _fear_ effect, she can choose to end the _battle cry_'s effect on her to reroll the failed save. The ally must take the result of the reroll, even if it's lower. Each ally can use this effect only once per use of this feat.
