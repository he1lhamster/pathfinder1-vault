# Hidden Presence

You are adept at hiding within your host.

**Prerequisites:** Int or Cha 17, ability to cast _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_ or greater _possession_.

**Benefit:** While possessing another creature, you can hide yourself from divinations and pass through wards such as _[[spells/Magic Circle against Evil|magic circle against evil]]_ or the effects of a _[[spells/Forbiddance|forbiddance]]_ spell. You must attempt a Will save against the spell (even if it doesn't normally allow a saving throw). If you succeed, the spell treats you as if you were your host (for instance, divinations would reveal only the host's alignment, and _forbiddance_ keyed to the host's alignment wouldn't damage you). If your saving throw fails, the spell functions against you as normal; if the spell normally allows a save, your previous failure doesn't count as a failed save against the spell's normal effects.
