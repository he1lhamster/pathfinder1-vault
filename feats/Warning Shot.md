# Warning Shot (Combat)

An intentional near-miss demonstrates your frightening skill at range.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Point-Blank Shot|Point-Blank Shot]]_, _[[feats/Precise Shot|Precise Shot]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_, proficiency with the selected weapon.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can make a ranged touch attack using a ranged weapon with which you have _Weapon Focus_. If successful, instead of dealing damage or applying any other effects of the attack, you may attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target as a free action. The target doesn't need to be within 30 feet, nor does it need to be able to see or hear you.
