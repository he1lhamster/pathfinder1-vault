# Flanking Foil (Combat)

Fighting multiple foes is easy for you.

**Benefit:** Whenever you hit an adjacent opponent with a melee attack, until the start of your next turn, that opponent does not gain any flanking bonus on attack rolls while it is f lanking you and cannot deal sneak attack damage to you. It can still provide a flank for its allies.
