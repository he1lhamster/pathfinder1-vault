You can charm people into lowering their defenses, allowing you to ambush them more effectively.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Quick Draw|Quick Draw]]_, _[[feats/Persuasive|Persuasive]]_, base attack bonus +3.

**Benefit:** When you succeed at a Diplomacy check to change a creature's attitude, you can draw a weapon and make a single melee attack against that creature as an immediate action. If you changed your target's attitude to friendly or better, your target is considered _[[conditions/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]_ against this attack. If the target survives, it takes a -2 penalty on its initiative check for this combat. Once you attack a creature, its attitude becomes hostile.
