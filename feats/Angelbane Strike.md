# Angelbane Strike

You channel the power of your Abyssal patron through your weapon to punish the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Righteous|righteous]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Channel Smite|Channel Smite]]_, divine caster level 5th, channel negative energy class feature, demon lord patron deity.

**Benefit:** When you use _Channel Smite_ against a living creature with a good alignment, you treat all 1s on the _channel smite_ damage dice as 2s. If your target is either a good outsider or a divine caster who serves a good deity, you are considered 2 levels higher when determining how many channel energy damage dice you roll when using _Channel Smite_.
