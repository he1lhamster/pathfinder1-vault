# Eyes Of The Purge

Through _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ and persistence _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Inspired|inspired]]_ by the Great Purge of Stavian I, you have learned to detect the sources of divine magic in such effects' auras.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to cast _[[spells/Detect Magic|detect magic]]_ as a spell or spell-like ability.

**Benefit:** When you use _detect magic_ to determine the strength and location of the aura of a functioning spell, if that spell's caster used a holy symbol as a divine focus to cast the spell, you see a ghostly image of the deity's holy symbol as part of the spell's aura. Effects that block _[[spells/Divination|divination]]_ spells or effects also block the effects of this feat.
