# Luck Of Heroes

To others, it seems that you always have a _[[spells/Bit Of Luck|bit of luck]]_ around you.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Hero's Fortune|Hero's Fortune]]_.

**Benefit:** Whenever you spend a hero point to reroll a die roll or to grant yourself a bonus before a die roll is made, there is a chance that the hero point is not spent. Whenever you spend a hero point, roll a d20. If the result is greater than 15, the hero point is not spent. You cannot use this feat when you cheat death.
