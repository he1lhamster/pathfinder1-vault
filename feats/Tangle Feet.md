# Tangle Feet (Combat)

Creatures who cross your path find themselves tripping over their own feet.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Dodge|Dodge]]_, _[[feats/Mobility|Mobility]]_, _[[feats/Underfoot|Underfoot]]_ (Advanced Player's Guide 173), _[[monsters/Goblin|goblin]]_, Small size or smaller.

**Benefit:** When you successfully make an Acrobatics check to avoid provoking an attack of opportunity from a larger opponent when you move through its threatened area or its space, you can make that opponent lose its balance until the end of its next turn as a free action. While that creature's balance is lost, if it attempts to move, it must make a successful DC 15 Acrobatics check or fall _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_, wasting the move action. You can only affect one creature with this effect each round.
