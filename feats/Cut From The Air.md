# Cut From The Air (Weapon Mastery)

Your powerful and swift attacks can slice ranged attacks out of the air.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, base attack bonus +5, weapon _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ class feature with a melee weapon.

**Benefit:** When a ranged attack is made against you or a target adjacent to you, you can cut the weapon (or ammunition) out of the air, def lecting the attack so the target takes no damage. As an attack of opportunity, make a melee attack roll at your highest bonus. If the result is greater than the attack roll total of the ranged attack, the attack is def lected. You must be aware of the attack and not _[[conditions/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]_. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by spell effects cannot be def lected.
