# Two-Weapon Drunkard (Combat Feat)

You effortlessly wield tankards in your off hand, and can use them to drink from and as _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ weapons in a battle with equal ease.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Catch Off-Guard|Catch Off-Guard]]_, _[[feats/Two-Weapon Fighting|Two-Weapon Fighting]]_

**Benefit:** When you wield a tankard as an improvised weapon in your off hand, it functions as a _[[items/Weapon/Light mace|light mace]]_, including for the purpose of determining the effects of feats like _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_. If you worship Cayden Cailean, your off-hand tankard functions as a divine focus and does not interfere with somatic spell components. When you fight with two weapons and have the _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ condition, you do not apply the penalties from being _sickened_ to attack rolls or weapon damage rolls.

**Normal:** A tankard wielded as an improvised weapon normally functions as a _[[items/Weapon/Gauntlet|gauntlet]]_.
