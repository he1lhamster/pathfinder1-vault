# Wyvern Sting (Combat)

You can use your _[[items/Weapon/Whip|whip]]_ like a _[[monsters/Wyvern|wyvern]]_'s sting, forcing foes to give it their undivided attention.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Exotic Weapon Proficiency|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]]_ (_whip_), _[[feats/Wyvern Fury Style|Wyvern Fury Style]]_, Acrobatics 6 ranks, _[[classes/Brawler|brawler]]_'s flurryACG class feature or flurry of blows class feature.

**Benefit:** While using _Wyvern Fury Style_, if you successfully attack a foe with a _whip_ or scorpion whipUC, as a swift action you can choose one ally. Until the beginning of your next turn, that ally can leave spaces threatened by that foe without provoking an attack of opportunity from the foe.
