# Snake Sidewind (Combat)

Your sensitive twisting movements make you difficult to anticipate combat.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Snake Style|Snake Style]]_, Acrobatics 3 ranks, Sense Motive 6 ranks.

**Benefit:** You gain a +4 bonus to CMD against _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ combat maneuvers and on Acrobatics checks and saving throws to avoid being knocked _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_. While using the _Snake Style_ feat, whenever you score a critical threat with your unarmed strike, you can make a Sense Motive check in place of the attack roll to confirm the critical hit. Whenever you score a critical hit with your unarmed strike, you can spend an immediate action to take a 5-foot step even if you have otherwise moved this round.

**Normal:** You can take a 5-foot step only if you have not otherwise moved this round.
