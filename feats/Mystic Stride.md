# Mystic Stride

Enchanted vegetation does not bar your path.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15, _[[feats/Nimble Moves|Nimble Moves]]_, woodland stride class feature.

**Benefit:** You can move at full speed even through thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, even if those areas confer the _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_ condition.

**Normal:** Woodland stride does not apply to thorns, briars, and overgrowth areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated.
