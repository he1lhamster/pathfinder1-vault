# Shared Manipulation

You can subtly bolster allies' ability to misdirect and infuriate their enemies.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, half-elf.

**Benefit:** As a move action, you can grant all friendly creatures within 30 feet who can see or hear you a +2 bonus on Bluff or Intimidate checks (choose which skill to affect each time you use this ability) for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round).
