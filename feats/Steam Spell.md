# Steam Spell (Metamagic)

You've built off of some of the closely-guarded secrets of the _[[monsters/Undine|undine]]_ steamcasters, allowing you to use fire magic _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_ easily.

**Benefit:** You can apply _[[feats/Steam Spell|Steam Spell]]_ only to a spell with the fire descriptor. A _steam spell_ works _underwater_ without a caster level check, but it requires a caster level check to function above water. A _steam spell_ uses up a slot the same spell level as the spell's actual level.
