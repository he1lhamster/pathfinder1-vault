# Crossbow Mastery (Combat)

You can load crossbows with _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Blinding|blinding]]_ speed and even fire them in melee with little _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ of _[[items/Weapon/Reprisal|reprisal]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15, _[[feats/Point-Blank Shot|Point-Blank Shot]]_, _[[feats/Rapid Reload|Rapid Reload]]_, _[[feats/Rapid Shot|Rapid Shot]]_.

**Benefit:** The time required for you to reload any type of crossbow is reduced to a free action, regardless of the type of crossbow used. You can fire a crossbow as many times in a full attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow. Reloading a crossbow for the type of crossbow you chose when you took _Rapid Reload_ no longer provokes attacks of opportunity.

**Special:** Starting at 6th level, a _[[classes/Ranger|ranger]]_ with the archery combat style may select _[[feats/Crossbow Mastery|Crossbow Mastery]]_ as a combat style feat.
