# Phantom Fortification

Your phantom remains partly immaterial even when fully manifested in ectoplasmic form.

**Prerequisites:** Phantom class feature, phantom with the _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ _[[universal monster rules/Flight|flight]]_ ability.

**Benefit:** Your phantom has a 50% chance of ignoring critical hits and precision-based damage when fully manifested in its ectoplasmic form, as if wearing armor with the moderate _[[universal monster rules/Fortification|fortification]]_ special ability. This doesn't stack with other similar effects, and doesn't apply against attacks made with _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]]_ weapons or weaponlike constructs made of force (such as a _[[spells/Clenched Fist|clenched fist]]_, _[[spells/Mage's Sword|mage's sword]]_, or _[[spells/Spiritual Weapon|spiritual weapon]]_).
