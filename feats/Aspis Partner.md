# Aspis Partner

You have earned the attention of the Aspis Consortium and can call in favors when necessary.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are in a settlement that is the size of a small town or larger, you can purchase (but not sell) items through your Aspis contacts. Treat your current settlement as though it were a metropolis to determine its base value and available magic items. You pay a 5% markup for such items, and orders take 3d6 days to be delivered through Consortium channels. You can pay an additional 1,000 gp to have your item magically delivered to you in 1d3 days instead.
