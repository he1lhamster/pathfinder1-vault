# Improved Planar Mentor

As you grow, so too does your mentor's influence.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Planar Mentor|Planar Mentor]]_*, character level 7th.

**Benefit:** You can benefit from your _Planar Mentor_ feat one additional time per day. While your mentor's boon is active, weapons and natural weapons you wield overcome _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_ as though they were weapons of that alignment (e.g., as good weapons for earning good approval). For neutral approval, your weapons and natural weapons overcome _damage reduction_ as cold iron and silver weapons. Once per day while benefiting from your mentor's boon, you can cast one of the following _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ based on the active boon's alignment (CL = your character level). Once you cast the spell-like ability, your mentor's boon ends immediately. Chaotic: _[[spells/Chaos Hammer|Chaos hammer]]_, _[[spells/Magic Circle against Law|magic circle against law]]_, _[[spells/Summon Monster IV|summon monster IV]]_ (chaotic outsiders only). Evil: _[[spells/Magic Circle against Good|Magic circle against good]]_, _summon monster IV_ (evil outsiders only), _[[spells/Unholy Blight|unholy blight]]_. Good: _[[spells/Holy Smite|Holy smite]]_, _[[spells/Magic Circle against Evil|magic circle against evil]]_, _summon monster IV_ (good outsiders only). Lawful: _[[spells/Magic Circle against Chaos|Magic circle against chaos]]_, _[[spells/Order's Wrath|order's wrath]]_, _summon monster IV_ (lawful outsiders only). Neutral: _[[spells/Bestow Curse|Bestow curse]]_, _[[spells/Prayer|prayer]]_, _summon monster IV_ (outsiders without alignment subtypes only).
