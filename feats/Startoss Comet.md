# Startoss Comet (Combat)

You can aim a thrown weapon so it strikes two foes.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Point-Blank Shot|Point-Blank Shot]]_, _[[feats/Startoss Style|Startoss Style]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ with the chosen weapon.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can make a single ranged thrown weapon attack at your full attack bonus with the chosen weapon. If you hit, you deal damage normally and can make a second attack (at your full attack bonus) against a target within one range increment of the first. You determine cover for this attack from the first target's space instead of your space. You can make only one additional attack per round with this feat. If you have _[[feats/Vital Strike|Vital Strike]]_, _[[feats/Improved Vital Strike|Improved Vital Strike]]_, or _[[feats/Greater Vital Strike|Greater Vital Strike]]_, you can add the additional damage from those feats to the initial ranged attack (but not the second attack).
