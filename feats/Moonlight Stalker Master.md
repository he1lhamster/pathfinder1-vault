# Moonlight Stalker Master (Combat)

You leave your opponents swinging at shadows while you slide elusively through the _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Blind-Fight|Blind-Fight]]_, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Improved Feint|Improved Feint]]_, _[[feats/Moonlight Stalker|Moonlight Stalker]]_, _[[feats/Moonlight Stalker Feint|Moonlight Stalker Feint]]_, Bluff 9 ranks, _[[spells/Darkvision|darkvision]]_ or _[[universal monster rules/Low-Light Vision|low-light vision]]_ racial trait.

**Benefit:** While you have concealment, your opponents' miss chance against you increases by 10%. If an opponent misses you due to your concealment, you can spend an immediate action to move 5 feet, this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count as a 5-foot step.
