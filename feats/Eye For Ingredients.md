# Eye For Ingredients

Your _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Keen|keen]]_ eyes help you find better deals on magical components for your spells.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Eschew Materials|Eschew Materials]]_, Appraise 6 ranks, Spellcraft 6 ranks.

**Benefit:** When in a large city or larger settlement, you can search the markets carefully for 4 hours in order to purchase material components for your spells at a 10% discount. You can purchase up to 1,000 gp worth of material components (which costs you 900 gp) each day. These cheaper components work perfectly well for their spells, but their resale value is also 10% less.
