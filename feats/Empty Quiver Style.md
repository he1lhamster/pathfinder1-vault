# Empty Quiver Style (Combat, Style)

You can fight in melee with your bow, crossbow, or firearm.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ with the chosen weapon.

**Benefit:** While using this style, you can make melee attacks with the chosen weapon as if it were a _[[items/Weapon/Heavy mace|heavy mace]]_ (or a _[[items/Weapon/Light mace|light mace]]_ for melee attack made with a _[[items/Weapon/Hand crossbow|hand crossbow]]_ or one-handed firearm), though you don't automatically threaten the area around you as if you were wielding a melee weapon. You can switch between melee and ranged attacks with this weapon without penalty, even during the same round. In addition, you ignore the elf prerequisite for the _[[feats/Stabbing Shot|Stabbing Shot]]_ featAPG. If you have the _Stabbing Shot_ feat, you can use it with a crossbow or firearm, substituting a loaded bolt or firearm ammunition for an arrow.

**Special:** In addition to the chosen weapon, a character with this feat and the weapon _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ (bows, crossbows, or firearms) class feature can use _[[feats/Empty Quiver Style|Empty Quiver Style]]_ with any bow, crossbow, or firearm, respectively.
