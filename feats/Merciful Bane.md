# Merciful Bane

You can use your _[[spells/Bane|bane]]_ ability to inflict nonlethal damage.

**Prerequisites:** _Bane_ class feature.

**Benefit:** While a weapon you wield is under the effect of your _bane_ class feature, you can spend a swift action to switch between dealing lethal or nonlethal damage with _bane_. While your _bane_ effect allows you to deal nonlethal damage in this way, you take no penalty on your attack roll for using a lethal weapon to deal nonlethal damage.

**Normal:** When using a lethal weapon to deal nonlethal damage, you take a -4 penalty on attack rolls.
