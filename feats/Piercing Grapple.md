# Piercing Grapple (Combat)

You can use _[[feats/Small But Deadly|small but deadly]]_ weapons to restrain a foe, forcing it to choose between pain and capitulation.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Quick Draw|Quick Draw]]_, Intimidate 7 ranks.

**Benefit:** You can draw a light or one-handed piercing weapon and stab your opponent with it when you _[[npcs/Initiate|initiate]]_ a grapple. You take a -2 penalty on your combat maneuver check to _initiate_ the grapple, but since you _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ the weapon out as part of the grapple, you don't take the usual -4 penalty. If you succeed, you grapple your opponent as normal, and the weapon doesn't count as being in your hand either for the purposes of the -4 penalty or for dealing damage while maintaining a grapple. If your opponent successfully breaks the grapple, it takes an amount of damage equal to the base weapon damage of the weapon you used to _initiate_ the grapple plus an additional 1d4 points of _[[universal monster rules/Bleed|bleed]]_ damage. A successful DC 15 _[[spells/Heal|Heal]]_ check or any magical healing ends the _bleed_ effect. If you choose to end the grapple, you can opt to not deal the _bleed_ damage, but either way, your opponent still takes the base weapon damage. While maintaining this grapple, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on all Intimidate checks made against your opponent.
