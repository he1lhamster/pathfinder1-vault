# Friendly Rivalry (Combat, Teamwork)

You fight harder when you're trying to score a quick kill in single combat before your ally does.

**Prerequisites:** Human (Taldan).

**Benefit:** If you're the only one threatening a foe and an ally within 30 feet who also has this feat is the only creature threatening a different foe, you gain a +2 morale bonus on your melee attack rolls against the foe that only you are threatening. You gain the bonus only if neither of the qualifying opponents is _[[conditions/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]_, _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ or otherwise unable to act. You must be able to see your ally to gain the benefit of this feat. If another ally who is not threatening your chosen foe makes any sort of attack against that foe (such as a ranged attack or a spell), you lose this feat's benefit for 1 round.
