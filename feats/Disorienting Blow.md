# Disorienting Blow (Combat)

When you successfully strike your opponent with your _[[feats/Stunning Fist|Stunning Fist]]_, you leave it in a state of _[[spells/Confusion|confusion]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _Stunning Fist_, base attack bonus +11.

**Benefit:** You must choose to use this ability before making an attack roll with your _Stunning Fist_, and this effect replaces other effects or conditions that would be caused by _Stunning Fist_. If you successfully hit your opponent and it fails its Fortitude save, it becomes _[[conditions/Confused|confused]]_ for 1 round. Additional disorienting blows to the _confused_ target add to the duration of its _confusion_. This feat is otherwise subject to all of the limits and conditions of _Stunning Fist_.
