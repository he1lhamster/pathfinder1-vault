# Lithe Attacker

Your unmatched _[[spells/Grace|grace]]_ allows you to strike even from the tightest crevices.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Narrow Frame|Narrow Frame]]_, Escape Artist 5 ranks, animal or magical beast.

**Benefit:** You can attack from nooks and crannies, even while using Escape Artist to _[[spells/Squeeze|squeeze]]_ through or into a narrow space less than half as wide as your normal space, and you do not lose your Dexterity bonus to AC while using Escape Artist to _squeeze_ through or into a narrow space. You still take a -4 penalty to AC while using Escape Artist in this way.
