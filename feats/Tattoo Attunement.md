# Tattoo Attunement

You've learned to absorb summoned creatures into temporary spell tattoos.

**Prerequisites:** Inscribe Magical TattooISM or Varisian TattooISWG; Spellcraft 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can touch a single creature that you've summoned, instantly transforming it into a magical _[[items/Mundane/Tattoo|tattoo]]_ on your body. This _tattoo_ takes up one magic item slot if the summoned creature is _[[classes/Medium|Medium]]_ or smaller, and one additional adjacent slot for each size category larger than _Medium_ (see page 16 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Magic for rules on magical tattoos). You can have only one such _tattoo_ at a time. While in _tattoo_ form, the summoned creature can't take actions and doesn't need to eat, sleep, or breathe; it retains the remaining duration of the summoning spell used to conjure it. The creature can stay in _tattoo_ form for a number of hours equal to your caster level. If the creature is still in _tattoo_ form at the end of that time, the _tattoo_ disappears, the creature is sent back to the plane from which it was summoned, and the remaining duration of the _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ is wasted. As a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can cause the creature to change from a _tattoo_ back into creature form, and appear in a square adjacent to you. The remaining duration of the spell is then expended as normal. The creature is _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1 round after emerging from _tattoo_ form. This is a supernatural ability.
