# Dynasty Founder (Story)

You will claim rulership of a city, whether under a larger government or independently.

**Prerequisites:** You must have lived in the chosen city for at least 1 year or be the heir of a former city leader.

**Benefit:** You gain followers as if you had the _[[feats/Leadership|Leadership]]_ feat, although you cannot attract followers of a level higher than your level - 2. If you also have the _Leadership_ feat, increase your _Leadership_ score by 3 for the purpose of determining how many followers you have.

**Goal:** Thwart all rivals to rulership over the chosen region, including at least one challenging foe.

**Completion Benefit:** You gain control of the settlement (see the settlement rules in the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide). Upon gaining this benefit and once per year thereafter, you can attempt to alter the settlement in one of the following ways by attempting a DC 25 Diplomacy check modified by the settlement's Society modifier or a DC 25 Intimidate check modified by its Law modifier: • Move the settlement's alignment 1 step closer to yours along either the good-evil or law-chaos axis. • Replace one settlement quality with another. • Change the government type. • Significantly alter the laws. Failure indicates that popular opinion in the city successfully opposes you. In addition, from now on, your followers gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and saving throws as long as they can see you.

**Special:** For groups using the kingdom-building rules from Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign, you can optionally use the rules for establishing a settlement to complete the goal of this story feat.

**Suggested Traits:** Domineering, Inspiring, Natural-Born LeaderAPG.
