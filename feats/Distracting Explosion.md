# Distracting Explosion

Your bombs explode with such force that they throw targets off their _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_ and provides an opening for your allies.

**Prerequisites:** Bomb class feature, _[[monsters/Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]]_.

**Benefit:** You can reduce your bomb damage by one die to give it the ability to distract the creature it strikes. If a creature takes a direct hit from your bomb, it must succeed at a Reflex saving throw against the bomb's DC or be unable to make attacks of opportunity for 1 round. This is in addition to any other effects the bomb would normally have.

**Normal:** The target of a bomb does not get a saving throw to avoid the bomb's effects.
