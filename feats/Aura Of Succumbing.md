# Aura Of Succumbing

Your foul patron's inf luence hastens death's approach.

**Prerequisites:** Channel energy class feature, worshiper of one of the Four Horsemen.

**Benefit:** As a swift action, you can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ one of your uses of channel energy to emanate a 30-foot-radius _[[feats/Aura Of Succumbing|aura of succumbing]]_ for a number of rounds equal to your effective _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ level. _[[conditions/Dying|Dying]]_ creatures in the area take 1 point of damage per die of your normal channel negative energy damage at the start of your turn each round. A successful Will save (DC equal to the DC of your channel energy ability) halves this damage. Whenever a living creature dies while within your _aura of succumbing_, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to that creature's Hit Dice. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour.
