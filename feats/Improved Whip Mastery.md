# Improved Whip Mastery (Combat)

You are able to _[[spells/Entangle|entangle]]_ opponents with the coils of your _[[items/Weapon/Whip|whip]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_whip_), _[[feats/Whip Mastery|Whip Mastery]]_, base attack bonus +5.

**Benefit:** While wielding a _whip_, you threaten the area of your natural reach plus 5 feet. You can also use a _whip_ to _[[spells/Grasp|grasp]]_ an unattended Small or Tiny object within your _whip_'s reach and _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ that object into your square. To do so, you must hit AC 10 with a melee touch attack. Further, you can use the _whip_ to _grasp_ onto an object within your _whip_'s reach, using 5 feet of your _whip_ as if it were a _[[items/Weapon/Grappling hook|grappling hook]]_, allowing you to use the rest of your _whip_ to swing on like a rope. As a free action, you can release the object your _whip_ is grasping, but you cannot use the _whip_ to attack while the _whip_ is grasping an object.
