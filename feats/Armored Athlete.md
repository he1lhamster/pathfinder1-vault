# Armored Athlete (Combat)

You have experience using a skill while armored.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Light Armor Proficiency|Light armor proficiency]]_, _[[feats/Medium Armor Proficiency|medium armor proficiency]]_, 3 ranks in any Dexterity- or Strength-based skill.

**Benefit:** Choose one Dexterity- or Strength-based skill in which you possess at least 3 ranks. When you attempt a check for the chosen skill, your armor check penalty on that check for wearing light or _[[classes/Medium|medium]]_ armor is reduced by 3 (to a minimum of 0). If you have 10 or more ranks in the skill, the penalty is instead reduced by 6 (to a minimum of 0). If you have armor _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ 2 and are proficient with heavy armor, this benefit also applies to armor check penalties for wearing heavy armor.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new skill.
