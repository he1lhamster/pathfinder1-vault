# Greater Bless Equipment

Your blessings are longer lasting, and you can _[[spells/Bless|bless]]_ more than one item at a time.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Bless Equipment|Bless Equipment]]_, _[[feats/Improved _Bless_ Equipment|Improved _Bless_ Equipment]]_, caster level 12th, channel energy class feature.

**Benefit:** The duration of your equipment blessings doubles. In addition, as a standard action you may _bless_ up to two pieces of equipment within range with a single blessing, expending uses of channeled energy as if you had only _[[feats/Blessed|blessed]]_ one item.
