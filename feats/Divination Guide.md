# Divination Guide

You deity grants you greater _[[spells/Guidance|guidance]]_ and divine insight.

**Prerequisites:** Caster level 3rd, ability to cast _[[spells/Augury|augury]]_ or _[[spells/Divination|divination]]_, must worship a deity.

**Benefit:** Whenever you cast _augury_ or _divination_, you receive further _guidance_ from your deity's agents. You gain a +1 _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sacred|sacred]]_ bonus if your worship a good deity or a +1 profane bonus if you worship an evil deity (if you worship a neutral deity the type of bonus is either determined by the type of energy you channel with the channel energy class feature or, if you don't have that class ability, your choice upon taking this feat) on all saving throws for 1 minute per caster level of the _augury_ or _divination_ spell you cast.
