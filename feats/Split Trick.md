# Split Trick (Trick)

You can _[[universal monster rules/Split|split]]_ a _[[classes/Mesmerist|mesmerist]]_ trick between two targets.

**Prerequisites:** _Mesmerist_ trick class feature.

**Benefit:** Whenever you implant a _mesmerist_ trick in a target, you can designate that trick as a _[[feats/Split Trick|split trick]]_. When doing so, you touch two targets and _split_ the trick between them. This counts as implanting a _mesmerist_ trick in both targets. The _mesmerist_ trick functions as normal, except that when the trick's triggering condition occurs, you must choose one of the _split trick_'s targets to receive the effects of the _split trick_. The other target receives no benefit from the trick.
