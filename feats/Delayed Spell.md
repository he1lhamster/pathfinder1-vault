# Delayed Spell (Metamagic)

You can set a spell to trigger on a delay.

**Benefit:** A _[[feats/Delayed Spell|delayed spell]]_ can be activated as a standard action anytime within 1 minute per spell level of being cast. Only spells that target one or more squares or grid intersections can be affected by _Delayed Spell_, and the target (as well as any other variables determined at the time of casting) cannot be changed once the _delayed spell_ is cast. You can have as many delayed spells as you _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ at any given time, but only one spell can be triggered in a single standard action. Though a _delayed spell_ does not manifest until it is triggered, it emits a magical aura as normal and can be identified with Knowledge (arcana) as a spell effect in place. A _delayed spell_ uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.
