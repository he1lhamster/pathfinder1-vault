# Knotted Nets (Combat, Teamwork)

You are capable of entangling far greater prey with the help of your allies.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Exotic Weapon Proficiency|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]]_ (_[[items/Mundane/Net|net]]_), base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** If you ready an attack with a _net_ to _[[spells/Entangle|entangle]]_ a creature when an ally of your size who also has this feat attempts to _entangle_ that creature with a _net_, the two of you can _entangle_ the creature as if you were one size category larger. The _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_ creature can attempt to escape both nets as though they were a single _net_, using the lower of the nets' hit points, hardness (if any), and DCs to break or escape. Only you or your ally can attempt to control the _entangled_ creature's movement with an opposed Strength check, but your ally grants you a +1 bonus on the check. If you work with three other allies of the same size who have this feat, you can _entangle_ a creature as if you were two size categories larger. If you work with seven other allies in this way, you can instead _entangle_ a creature as if you were three size categories larger.

**Normal:** A _net_ is useful against only creatures within one size category of you.
