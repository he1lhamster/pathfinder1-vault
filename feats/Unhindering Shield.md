# Unhindering Shield (Shield Mastery)

You are accustomed to fighting with your _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Shield Focus|Shield Focus]]_, base attack bonus +6 or _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_ level 4th, proficiency with bucklers.

**Benefit:** You still gain a _[[items/Armor/Buckler|buckler]]_'s bonus to AC even if you use your _shield_ hand for some other purpose. When you wield a _buckler_, your _shield_ hand is considered free for the purposes of casting spells, wielding weapons, and using any other abilities that require you to have a free hand or interact with your _shield_, such as the _[[classes/Swashbuckler|swashbuckler]]_'s _[[feats/Precise Strike|precise strike]]_ deed or the _[[feats/Weapon Finesse|Weapon Finesse]]_ feat.

**Special:** A _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ with this feat is not considered to be using a _shield_ for the purposes of his AC bonus, fast movement, or flurry of blows.
