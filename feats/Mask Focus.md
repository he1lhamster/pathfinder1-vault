# Mask Focus

You can use your _[[items/Mundane/Mask|mask]]_ as an additional focus for your arcane spells, enhancing their power.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Extend Spell|Extend Spell]]_, _[[feats/Nameless One|Nameless One]]_, ability to cast 3rd-level arcane spells.

**Benefit:** While you're benefiting from the _Nameless One_ feat (see below), the _mask_ you wear to gain the benefits of that feat satisfies the focus component of any spell you cast that requires a _mask_ (such as _[[spells/Mask From Divination|mask from divination]]_). In addition, once per day you can apply the _Extend Spell_ metamagic feat to an arcane spell without increasing the spell's level by adding your _mask_ as a focus component. When _Extend Spell_ is applied in this manner, its increase to duration applies only to effects that target you; other creatures use the spell's normal duration. For example, if you use this ability with the _[[spells/Haste|haste]]_ spell, the spell's effects last twice as long for you, but not for any other creature that you target with the spell.
