# Spell Chain (Teamwork)

You help your allies bypass your foes' magical defenses.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Spell Penetration|Spell Penetration]]_.

**Benefit:** Whenever you make a successful caster level check to overcome a target's _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_, the next ally who also has this feat that attempts to overcome the same target's _spell resistance_ can roll twice when attempting his own caster level check, taking the better result. This benefit must be used within 1 round or else it is lost.
