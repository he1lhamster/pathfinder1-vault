# Disrupting Shot (Combat)

With a well-placed shot, you make it harder for a nearby opponent to cast spells.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Point-Blank Shot|Point-Blank Shot]]_, _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_ level 6th.

**Benefit:** If you ready an action to shoot an opponent casting a spell within 30 feet and successfully hit that opponent with a ranged attack, the concentration DC to successfully cast the spell is increased by +4.
