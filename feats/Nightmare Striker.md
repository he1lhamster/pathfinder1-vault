# Nightmare Striker (Combat)

Your _[[spells/Faerie Fire|faerie fire]]_ not only illuminates your foes, but it also shows you their weaknesses.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Nightmare Fist|Nightmare Fist]]_, _[[feats/Nightmare Weaver|Nightmare Weaver]]_, _[[feats/Stunning Fist|Stunning Fist]]_, _[[spells/Heal|Heal]]_ 5 ranks, ability to cast _faerie fire_.

**Benefit:** While a _faerie fire_ you have cast (not one cast from a spell completion or spell trigger item) outlines an opponent, the DC for that opponent to resist your _Stunning Fist_ attempts increases by +2. If you hit an opponent with a _Stunning Fist_ attempt, and that opponent fails her saving throw, you can render the target _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 1d2 rounds plus 1 round for every 5 by which the opponent failed her save.
