# Quick Preparation

Early on in your adventuring career, you learned (perhaps the hard way) how to prepare your spells even when put under extreme time constraints.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to prepare spells.

**Benefit:** When preparing spells, you halve the time necessary to do so.

**Normal:** Preparing all of your spells takes 1 hour.
