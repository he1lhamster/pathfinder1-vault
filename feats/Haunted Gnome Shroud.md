# Haunted Gnome Shroud (Combat)

Your disturbing glamer expands to make your exact location hard to pinpoint.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, gnome magic racial trait, _[[feats/Haunted Gnome|Haunted Gnome]]_, _[[feats/Haunted Gnome Assault|Haunted Gnome Assault]]_, Knowledge (arcana) 6 ranks.

**Benefit:** You gain another independent use of your gnome magic like that which _Haunted Gnome Assault_ grants. Further, while you are under the effect of _[[spells/Haunted Fey Aspect|haunted fey aspect]]_, you also have concealment (20% miss chance) against an opponent until that opponent deals you damage.
