# Reach Spell (Metamagic)

Your spells go farther than normal.

**Benefit:** You can alter a spell with a range of touch, close, or _[[classes/Medium|medium]]_ to increase its range to a higher range category, using the following order: touch, close, _medium_, and long. A _[[feats/Reach Spell|reach spell]]_ uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level for each increase in range category. For example, a spell with a range of touch increased to long range uses up a spell slot three levels higher. Spells modif ied by this feat that require melee touch attacks instead require ranged touch attacks. Spells that do not have a range of touch, close, or _medium_ do not benefit from this feat.
