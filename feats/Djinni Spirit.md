# Djinni Spirit (Combat)

By calling upon the spirits of storms, you can manipulate lightning to protect yourself and buffet your enemies with peals of thunder.

**Prerequisites:** Con 15, Wis 15, _[[feats/Djinni Style|Djinni Style]]_, _[[feats/Elemental Fist|Elemental Fist]]_**, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +11 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 9th.

**Benefit:** You gain one additional _Elemental Fist_ (Advanced Player's Guide 158) attempt per day. While using _Djinni Style_, you gain electricity _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ equal to your base attack bonus or _monk_ level, whichever is higher. While denied your Dexterity bonus to AC you are also denied this _resistance_. Creatures that take electricity damage from your _Elemental Fist_ attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) or be _[[conditions/Deafened|deafened]]_ for 1d4 rounds. Those who take damage from your _[[feats/Djinni Spin|Djinni Spin]]_ are _deafened_, even on a successful saving throw.
