# Extra Grit (Grit)

You have more grit than the ordinary _[[classes/Gunslinger|gunslinger]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Grit class feature or the _[[feats/Amateur Gunslinger|Amateur Gunslinger]]_ feat.

**Benefit:** You gain 2 _[[feats/Extra Grit|extra grit]]_ points at the start of each day, and your maximum grit increases by 2.

**Normal:** If you are a _gunslinger_, you gain your Wisdom modifier in grit points at the start of each day, which is also your maximum grit. If you have the _Amateur Gunslinger_ feat, you gain 1 grit point at the start of each day, and your maximum grit is equal to your Wisdom modifier.

**Special:** If you possess levels in the _gunslinger_ class, you can take this feat multiple times.
