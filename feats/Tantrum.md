# Tantrum (Combat)

Your crying, sputtering, and even frothing at the mouth makes you so laughably incoherent that opponents are apt to dismiss you as a threat.

**Prerequisites:** Bluff 1 rank, _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ class feature, gnome.

**Benefit:** You may use the Bluff skill to feint while raging. The effect of the feint lasts only until the first time you hit the target.
