# Net and Trident (Combat)

Your skill with lighter weapons allows you to wield one alongside your _[[items/Mundane/Net|net]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15, _[[feats/Exotic Weapon Proficiency|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]]_ (_net_), _[[feats/Net Adept|Net Adept]]_, _[[feats/Two-Weapon Fighting|Two-Weapon Fighting]]_.

**Benefit:** You can treat a _net_ as a one-handed ranged weapon, allowing you to wield a light or one-handed melee weapon and still make ranged attacks with your _net_. When you use your light or one-handed melee weapon to attack an _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_ opponent, you gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls and on attack rolls to confirm a critical hit.

**Normal:** A _net_ is a two-handed ranged weapon.
