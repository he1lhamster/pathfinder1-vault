# Monastic Legacy (Combat)

Your formal unarmed _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ continues to bolster your _training_ in other areas.

**Prerequisites:** Still mind class feature, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_.

**Benefit:** Add half the levels you have in classes other than _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ to your _monk_ level to determine your effective _monk_ level for your base unarmed strike damage. This feat does not make levels in classes other than _monk_ count toward any other _monk_ class features.
