# Opening Volley (Combat)

Your ranged assault leaves your foe disoriented and vulnerable to your melee attack.

**Benefit:** Whenever you deal damage with a ranged attack, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the next melee attack roll you make against the opponent. This attack must occur before the end of your next turn.
