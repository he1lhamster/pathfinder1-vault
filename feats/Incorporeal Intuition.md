# Incorporeal Intuition

You notice _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ creatures, even those lurking in walls.

**Prerequisites:** _[[classes/Psychic|Psychic]]_ SensitivityOA or the ability to cast _psychic_ spells, Spirit SenseOA.

**Benefit:** You can sense the presence and movement of _incorporeal_ creatures though solid walls, as long as that _incorporeal_ creature is adjacent to you. When you sense a creature in this way, you can attempt a Knowledge (religion) check to _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ the creature and its special powers or _[[universal monster rules/Vulnerabilities|vulnerabilities]]_, with a -5 penalty. When you sense an _incorporeal_ creature with this ability and use a readied action to attack it when it attacks from inside the wall, it doesn't gain cover against your attack.

**Normal:** _Incorporeal_ creatures are silent unless they choose to make a sound and are thus almost impossible to detect when inside a solid wall. When readying to attack an _incorporeal_ creature in a solid wall, it gains cover against your attack.
