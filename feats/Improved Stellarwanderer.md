**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Stellar Wanderer|Stellar Wanderer]]_*, Knowledge (planes) 15 ranks.

**Benefit:** When using the _Stellar Wanderer_ feat for _planar_ travel, you can choose up to eight creatures to be transported with you. You now appear 1 to 100 miles (1d%) from your intended destination rather than 5 to 500 miles.
