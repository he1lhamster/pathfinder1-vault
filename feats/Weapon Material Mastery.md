# Weapon Material Mastery (Weapon Mastery)

You can perform impressive deeds with weapons made from peculiar materials.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +7, weapon _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ class feature with a melee weapon.

**Benefit:** While wielding an appropriate melee weapon, you gain the following special abilities, based on which special material the weapon is primarily constructed of (if any). 
Adamantine: Your critical hits ignore the target's DR. 
Alchemical Silver, Mithral, or _[[items/Wondrous Item/Silversheen|Silversheen]]_: When you successfully deal damage to a creature that is under the effects of an illusion or _[[spells/Polymorph|polymorph]]_ effect (such as _[[spells/Disguise Self|disguise self]]_ or the _[[universal monster rules/Change Shape|change shape]]_ special ability), its wound fizzles and boils loudly, revealing the presence of such effects. If the effect is a racial ability, anyone that sees you attack the creature gains a +4 bonus on Knowledge checks to _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ the creature. In addition, you immediately receive a Will save to disbelieve any illusion effect on the creature that allows disbelief. 
Cold Iron: When you score a critical hit against a target benefiting from spells that grant temporary hit points or bonuses to AC, ability scores, attack rolls, damage rolls, or saving throws, you must immediately attempt a special dispel check (1d20 + your base attack bonus) as a targeted dispel as per the _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ spell, but targeting only those spells. Once a creature has been the target of this effect, you can't affect it in this way again for 24 hours. 
Elysium BronzeUE: When you damage a magical beast or monstrous humanoid, the creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your base attack bonus + your Strength modifier) or lose access to a randomly selected supernatural or spell-like ability (if any). Once a creature has been the target of this effect, you can't affect it in this way again for 24 hours. 
Fire-Forged SteelUE or Frost-Forged SteelUE: When your weapon is exposed to 10 points or more of energy damage (fire for fire-forged steel or cold for frost-forged steel), the weapon adds +1d6 points of energy damage to its attacks instead of +1d4 points of energy damage. Additionally, the duration of this effect increases by 1 round for every 5 points of the appropriate type of energy damage to which the weapon is exposed beyond 10. 
GreenwoodUE or Living SteelUE: When you score a critical hit, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your base attack bonus + your Strength modifier) or lose its _[[universal monster rules/Fast Healing|fast healing]]_ and _[[universal monster rules/Regeneration|regeneration]]_ (if any) for 1d3 rounds. 
ViridiumUE: You add your Strength modifier and the weapon's enhancement bonus (if any) to the Fortitude DC to determine if a foe struck by the weapon contracts _[[diseases/Leprosy|leprosy]]_. 
WhipwoodUE: The weapon gains the _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ special weapon feature, and you gain a +2 bonus on _trip_ combat maneuvers made with it. 
WyrootUE: Once per turn, you can absorb life points from the weapon as a free action instead of a swift action. You can never absorb life points from wyroot weapons or equipment more than once per turn.
