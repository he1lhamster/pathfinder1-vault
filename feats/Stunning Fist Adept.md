# Stunning Fist Adept (Combat)

Your _[[feats/Stunning Fist|Stunning Fist]]_ strikes become even deadlier.

**Prerequisites:** _Stunning Fist_, base attack bonus +3.

**Benefit:** Add +1 to the saving throw DC against your _Stunning Fist_ attacks. This bonus does not stack with feats that grant you bonuses to the DC for saving throws against your _Stunning Fist_ attacks, such as _[[feats/Mantis Style|Mantis Style]]_ (see Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat).
