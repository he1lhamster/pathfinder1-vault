# Fire Music

Your ability to command fire and bardic music has created a strange _[[spells/Blend|blend]]_ of both magics.

**Prerequisites:** Spellcraft 5 ranks, ability to cast _[[classes/Bard|bard]]_ spells, ability to cast an arcane fire spell from some other spellcasting class.

**Benefit:** When you cast a _bard_ spell that deals damage, you may replace the spell's normal damage with fire damage or _[[universal monster rules/Split|split]]_ the spell's damage so that half of it is the normal damage type and half is fire damage. If you cast a _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ monster spell as a _bard_ spell, you may choose to give the summoned creature a fiery appearance, which gives it fire _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ 5 and adds +1 fire damage to all of its _[[universal monster rules/Natural Attacks|natural attacks]]_. The creature sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. This aspect of the feat has no effect if the creature already has the fire subtype. When you use this feat, the affected spell gains the fire descriptor.
