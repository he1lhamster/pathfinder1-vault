# Sisterhood Dedication (Combat)

The _[[monsters/Gray|Gray]]_ Maidens' bond with each other goes beyond simple combat coordination. An elite member of the sisterhood is an inspiration to her fellow women, both _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Invigorating|invigorating]]_ their spirits and effortlessly coordinating their tactics.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, _[[feats/Shield Focus|Shield Focus]]_, _[[spells/Shield|Shield]]_ WallAPG, _[[feats/Sisterhood Rampart|Sisterhood Rampart]]_, _[[feats/Sisterhood Style|Sisterhood Style]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_[[items/Weapon/Longsword|longsword]]_), base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** While you're using _Sisterhood Style_ and wielding a _longsword_ and either a light or heavy _shield_, the bonus on saving throws from _Sisterhood Style_ increases to +2 and you grant half that bonus to all allies within 20 feet. In addition, you can choose up to two teamwork feats you have when entering the _Sisterhood Style_ stance. As a swift action, you can grant one of those feats to two allies within 20 feet until the beginning of your next turn, or you can grant both feats to one ally within 20 feet until the beginning of your next turn.
