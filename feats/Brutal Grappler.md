# Brutal Grappler (Combat, Teamwork)

When helping an ally grapple, you can damage the target.

**Prerequisites:** Half-orc or _[[monsters/Orc|orc]]_.

**Benefit:** When you and an ally with this feat have _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ the same creature, you may attempt to damage the opponent on your turn (whether you were the one who first initiated the grapple or were assisting your ally in doing so). You and the ally are treated as aiding each other in the grapple (+2 bonus on your grapple combat maneuver) as long as you both decide to maintain the grapple.

**Normal:** When multiple creatures grapple one target, the creature that first initiates the grapple is the only one that makes a check to damage a _grappled_ opponent, with a +2 bonus for each creature that assists the grapple using the Aid Another action.
