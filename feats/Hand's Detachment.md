# Hand's Detachment

Your _[[feats/Possessed Hand|possessed hand]]_ can painlessly _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ free of your body or reattach itself, leaving you with a bloodless but raw-looking stump at the end of one arm while the hand itself performs remote tasks under your command, acting in many ways like a strange familiar.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Hand's Autonomy|Hand's Autonomy]]_, _Possessed Hand_.

**Benefit:** You can remove your _possessed hand_, allowing the possessing spirit to animate and control its motion. Removing or reattaching your _possessed hand_ is a full-round action. This deals no damage to you, but you can't use the hand while it is removed. The hand acts as a _[[classes/Wizard|wizard]]_'s familiar, using your character level as your effective _wizard_ level, except it doesn't gain the _[[feats/Alertness|alertness]]_, _[[feats/Share Spells|share spells]]_, deliver touch spells, _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_, or scry on familiar abilities. Use the statistics for a _[[monsters/Crawling Hand|crawling hand]]_ (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 59) to represent the detached hand, save that the hand isn't undead, doesn't have the mark quarry ability, and shares your alignment. If the hand is destroyed, the spirit regenerates your missing hand in 2d4 days. This process can be accelerated by _[[spells/Regenerate|regenerate]]_ or similar magic. You cannot use the _Possessed Hand_ feat or any feat with the _Possessed Hand_ feat as a prerequisite until the hand is fully regenerated. If you have the familiar class feature, you can choose for your _possessed hand_ to become your familiar, granting it all familiar abilities as normal. If selected as a familiar, your _possessed hand_ grants you a +3 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks.
