# Feint Partner (Combat, Teamwork)

A little diversion is all you need to slip through your foe's defenses.

**Prerequisites:** Bluff 1 rank.

**Benefit:** Whenever an ally who also has this feat successfully feints an opponent, that opponent also loses his Dexterity bonus to AC against the next attack you make against him before the end of the feinting ally's next turn.
