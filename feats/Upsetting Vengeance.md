# Upsetting Vengeance (Combat)

You punish those who fail to press their attack.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_, _[[feats/Improved _[[spells/Shield|Shield]]_ Bash|Improved _Shield_ Bash]]_, _[[feats/Upsetting _Shield_ Style|Upsetting _Shield_ Style]]_, _[[feats/Upsetting Strike|Upsetting Strike]]_, proficiency with bucklers.

**Benefit:** While using _Upsetting _Shield_ Style_, the penalty on attack rolls foes take for being hit by your _shield_ bash attack applies to their attacks against any target. If an adjacent foe taking this penalty makes an attack roll against any target and misses the target's AC by 5 or more, that foe provokes an attack of opportunity from you. You can only make one attack of opportunity against an opponent as a result of this feat or _Upsetting Strike_ each round.
