# Poison Shot Deed (Grit)

You can specially prepare bullets to deliver poisons that are normally used more subtly.

**Prerequisites:** Amateur GunslingerUC or gritUC class feature.

**Benefit:** You can spend 1 grit point to load your firearm with 1 dose of inhaled or ingested poison as a move action. This action has no chance of exposing you to the poison (as if you had the poison use class feature). Shooting a firearm loaded with a poison in this manner is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity and sprays out the poison in a 15-foot cone. Any creatures caught in the blast take no damage but are exposed to this poison and must each immediately attempt a save against the poison as though the onset time had elapsed.
