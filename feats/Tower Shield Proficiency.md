# Tower Shield Proficiency (Combat)

You are trained in how to properly use a _[[items/Shield/Tower shield|tower shield]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Shield Proficiency|Shield Proficiency]]_.

**Benefit:** When you use a _tower shield_, the _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_'s armor check penalty only applies to Strength and Dexterity-based skills.

**Normal:** A character using a _shield_ with which he is not proficient takes the _shield_'s armor check penalty on attack rolls and on all skill checks that involve moving, including Ride.

**Special:** Fighters automatically have _[[feats/Tower _Shield_ Proficiency|Tower _Shield_ Proficiency]]_ as a bonus feat. They need not select it.
