# Guardian of the Wild

Your mystic connection with the wilderness enhances your ability to react to threats.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Attuned to the Wild|Attuned to the Wild]]_, elf.

**Benefit:** When you are in a terrain type you have selected the _Attuned to the Wild_ feat for, you gain a +2 _[[feats/Dodge|dodge]]_ bonus to Armor Class. If you are in an area that qualifies as more than one kind of terrain, these bonuses do not stack; you receive the bonus for only one of the terrain types.
