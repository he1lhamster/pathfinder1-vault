# Courageous Resolve

Even when others run, you tend to stand your ground.

**Prerequisites:** Craven racial trait or fearless racial trait, halfling.

**Benefit:** If you have the fearless racial trait, your racial bonus on saving throws against _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effects increases to +4. If you have the craven racial trait, you still take the -2 penalty on _fear_ saves, but you can gain the benefit of morale bonuses on saving throws against _fear_ effects.
