# Amateur Swashbuckler (Combat)

Although you're not a _[[classes/Swashbuckler|swashbuckler]]_, you have and can use panache.

**Prerequisites:** No levels in a class that has the panache class feature.

**Benefit:** You gain a small amount of panache and the ability to perform a single 1st-level _swashbuckler_ deed. Choose a 1st-level deed from the _swashbuckler_'s deeds class feature (see page 56; you can't select opportune parry and riposte). Once chosen, this deed can't be changed. At the start of each day, you gain 1 panache point. Throughout the day, you can gain a number of panache points, up to a maximum equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You can regain panache points as the _swashbuckler_'s panache class feature (see page 56). You can spend these points to perform the 1st-level deed you chose upon taking this feat as well as any other deeds you have gained through feats or magic items.

**Special:** If you later gain levels in a class that has the panache class feature, you can immediately trade this feat for the _[[feats/Extra Panache|Extra Panache]]_ feat.
