# Nature's Wrath

Though a plant creature, you are infused with the _[[spells/Blight|Blight]]_ Caller's primal _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ against civilization.

**Prerequisites:** Int 1, any nongood alignment, plant type.

**Benefit:** You are no longer immune to effects that cause morale bonuses or effects with the emotion descriptor, and you take a -1 penalty on saves against anger or _rage_ emotion effects. You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls against humanoid creatures.
