# Stylized Spell (Metamagic)

You cast a spell in a distinctive manner

**Prerequisites:** Bluff 5 ranks, Spellcraft 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** A _[[feats/Stylized Spell|stylized spell]]_ has slightly different verbal and somatic components than normal, and the spell effect appears noticeably different. The Spellcraft DC to _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ a _stylized spell_ as it is being cast is 10 higher than normal. The Knowledge (arcana) DC to _identify_ a _stylized spell_, its effects, or the materials it creates is 10 higher than normal, as is the DC to recognize your magical signature with greater _[[spells/Detect Magic|detect magic]]_. When you apply this feat to a spell, you can attempt to disguise your _stylized spell_ as another spell of the same school and subschool with the same descriptors. The other spell must be either the same spell level as the _stylized spell_ (before applying the metamagic adjustment) or 1 spell level higher. If you do so, the _stylized spell_ gains the ruse descriptor (see page 192) and takes on some superficial aspects of the other spell. As usual for a spell with the ruse descriptor, identification attempts that fail by 10 or less mistakenly _identify_ it as the chosen spell (those that fail by more can't _identify_ it at all). A _stylized spell_ uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.
