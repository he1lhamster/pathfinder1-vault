# Dazing Spell (Metamagic)

You can _[[spells/Daze|daze]]_ creatures with the power of your spells.

**Benefit:** You can modify a spell to _daze_ a creature damaged by the spell. When a creature takes damage from this spell, they become _[[conditions/Dazed|dazed]]_ for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the _daze_ effect. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can make a Will save to negate the _daze_ effect. If the spell effect also causes the creature to become _dazed_, the duration of this metamagic effect is added to the duration of the spell. A _[[feats/Dazing Spell|dazing spell]]_ uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level. Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.
