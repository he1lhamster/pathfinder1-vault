# Remote Bomb

You can set off your delayed bombs at great distances.

**Prerequisites:** Delayed bomb discovery.

**Benefit:** The maximum delay for your delayed bombs increases to a number of minutes equal to your level. If you have line of effect to your delayed bomb, you may _[[spells/Detonate|detonate]]_ it earlier than its preset time by making a DC 20 Intelligence check; the DC increases by +1 for every 10 feet of distance between you and the bomb.
