# Thrill of the Kill

Killing fuels your _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Half-orc or _[[monsters/Orc|orc]]_, _rage_ class feature.

**Benefit:** When you are raging and your attack brings an enemy to negative hit points or kills them, you regain 1 round of _rage_. You may only use this feat if the _[[monsters/Fallen|fallen]]_ enemy had at least as many Hit Dice as you.
