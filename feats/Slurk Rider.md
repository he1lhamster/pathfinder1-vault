# Slurk Rider (Combat)

You are skilled at riding slurks into battle.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Kobold|Kobold]]_.

**Benefit:** You are able to control, guide, and communicate with slurks (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 251), as if they understood Draconic. You can also spend a standard action to manipulate the nodules on the _[[monsters/Slurk|slurk]]_'s back to activate its slime ability. Both you and the _slurk_ can activate this ability during the same round.
