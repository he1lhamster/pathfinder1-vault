# Underfoot (Combat)

You slip under and around your larger foes.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Dodge|Dodge]]_, _[[feats/Mobility|Mobility]]_, Small size or smaller.

**Benefit:** You receive a +4 _dodge_ bonus on Acrobatics checks to move past opponents without provoking attacks of opportunity, so long as they are larger than you. In addition, you gain a +2 _dodge_ bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity caused when you move out of or within a larger opponent's threatened area (this stacks with the +4 bonus provided by _Mobility_, for a total bonus of +6).
