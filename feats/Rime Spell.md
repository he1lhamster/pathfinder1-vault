# Rime Spell (Metamagic)

Creatures damaged by your spells with the cold descriptor become _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_.

**Benefit:** The frost of your cold spell clings to the target, impeding it for a short time. A _[[feats/Rime Spell|rime spell]]_ causes creatures that takes cold damage from the spell to become _entangled_ for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell. This feat only affects spells with the cold descriptor. A _rime spell_ uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
