# Covering Shield (Combat)

You can use your _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ to protect your most vulnerable parts from area effects.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Shield Focus|Shield Focus]]_, _[[feats/Shield Proficiency|Shield Proficiency]]_.

**Benefit:** While using a _shield_ of the type to which your _Shield Focus_ feat applies, you gain a bonus on Ref lex saves against area of effect attacks equal to your _shield_'s base bonus to armor class plus any bonuses granted by feats or class abilities. This does not transfer any enhancement bonuses on a _shield_ to Ref lex saves.
