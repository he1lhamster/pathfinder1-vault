# Unseen Poison

You can conceal the magic auras of poisons that you carry.

**Prerequisites:** Bluff 5 ranks, Craft (poison) 5 ranks, ability to cast _[[spells/Nondetection|nondetection]]_.

**Benefit:** Whenever a creature attempts to magically _[[spells/Detect Poison|detect poison]]_ you are carrying, the creature must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + your character level. On a failed check, that spell or magic ability fails to detect any poison you possess for the duration of the spell.
