# Manipulative Presence

When you discard your host, you alter or obliterate its memory of your handiwork.

**Prerequisites:** Int or Cha 19, _[[spells/Hidden Presence|Hidden Presence]]_, ability to cast _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_ or greater _possession_.

**Benefit:** Upon completion of your _possession_, you can alter up to 5 minutes of your host's memories as you see fit. This functions as the _[[spells/Modify Memory|modify memory]]_ spell. Your host's awareness of the _possession_ doesn't _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Impact|impact]]_ this ability, and if your control of the host lasted less than 5 minutes, you can cause it to forget the _possession_ entirely. The host can attempt a Will save with a DC equal to that of the original _possession_ effect to resist this alteration.
