# Eagle's Resolve

You are resolute in your opposition to slavery and oppression, and the very thought of mental control disgusts you.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Iron Will|Iron Will]]_.

**Benefit:** You receive a +1 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. When you succeed at such a saving throw, you gain a +2 morale bonus on all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against the source of that effect for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level, or if the effect is not a spell, for a number of rounds equal to one-third the Hit Dice of the creature that created the effect.
