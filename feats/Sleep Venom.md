# Sleep Venom

You can change the nature of your _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Toxic|toxic]]_ spittle to put your enemies to sleep.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Vishkanya|Vishkanya]]_.

**Benefit:** As a swift action, you may alter the effects of your venom so the target falls _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_. This changes the initial and secondary effect of your venom to the following: initial effect _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1d4 rounds; secondary effect unconsciousness for 1 minute. You must make the decision to alter your venom before you apply it to a weapon.

**Normal:** _Vishkanya_ venom deals Dexterity damage.
