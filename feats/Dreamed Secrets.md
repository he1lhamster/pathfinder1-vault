# Dreamed Secrets

When you sleep you gain secrets from beyond the stars, but such power comes with a price.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to cast divine spells, caster level 7th, worshiper of a Great Old One or Outer God.

**Benefit:** With each night's rest, you can choose two spells from the _[[classes/Wizard|wizard]]_ spell list, both of which must be at least 1 _wizard_ spell level lower than the highest level divine spell you can cast. If you are a spontaneous caster, these spells are added to your spells known for 24 hours. If you prepare spells, you can prepare these spells any time you do so in the next 24 hours. Each time you attempt to cast one of the _wizard_ spells you have chosen, you must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or take 1d2 points of Wisdom damage and fail to cast the spell, though you do not lose the spell.
