# Vampiric Animal Companion

As a _[[monsters/Vampire|vampire]]_, you may use your create spawn ability to transform a dire bat, dire rat, or _[[monsters/Wolf|wolf]]_ into a more powerful _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vampiric|vampiric]]_ companion.

**Prerequisites:** _Vampire_, Charisma 18, animal companion class ability, sufficiently high level (see below).

**Benefit:** A _vampire_ with this feat can elect to use its create spawn ability on an animal summoned using the child of the night ability (such as a dire bat, dire rat, or _wolf_ ) to create a _[[feats/Vampiric Animal Companion|vampiric animal companion]]_. This decision must be made as a free action as the _vampire_ slays the animal with its _[[universal monster rules/Blood Drain|blood drain]]_ or _[[universal monster rules/Energy Drain|energy drain]]_ ability. The animal rises from death in 1d4 days as a _vampiric_ animal bonded with the _vampire_ who spawned it. Thereafter, the _vampiric_ animal advances in abilities like a normal animal companion as the _vampire_ gains further class levels in the class that granted the animal companion. In order to gain a dire rat as a _vampiric_ companion, a _vampire_'s effective _[[classes/Druid|druid]]_ level must be 4th. To gain a _wolf_ as an _vampiric_ companion, the _vampire_'s effective _druid_ level must be 6th. To gain a dire bat _vampiric_ companion, the _vampire_'s effective _druid_ level must be 9th. At your option, additional animals could be added to this list-use these examples as guides to set minimum levels. _Vampiric_ animal companions count toward the total number of Hit Dice a _vampire_ may enslave, as well as toward the limit of animal companions the character may have at any one time. Any _vampiric animal companion_ the _vampire_ creates that would exceed such limits becomes a free-willed undead. A _vampire_ may also free a _vampiric_ companion in order to enslave a new one, but once freed, the _vampiric_ animal cannot be enslaved again. A _vampiric_ animal's statistics are identical to those of the original animal, save for the following changes.

* Its type changes to undead with the augmented animal subtype. 
* It gains a +4 natural armor bonus. 
* It gains the _blood drain_ _vampire_ special attack. 
* It gains an _energy drain_ attack (1 level, DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the animal companion's racial HD + the animal companion's Charisma modifier). 
* It gains the dominate _vampire_ special attack with respect to animals of its type. 
* It gains _[[universal monster rules/Channel Resistance|channel resistance]]_ +2, DR 5/silver, resist cold and electricity 10, _[[universal monster rules/Fast Healing|fast healing]]_ 2, and the _vampire_ qualities of _[[spells/Gaseous Form|gaseous form]]_ and shadowless. 
* It gains all of the standard _vampire_ weaknesses. 
* It gains Str +2, Dex +2, and Cha +4. 
* It does not gain the _vampire_'s children of the night or create spawn abilities.
