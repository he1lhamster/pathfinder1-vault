# Ace Disarm (Targeting, Weapon Mastery)

You catch objects with your ranged attacks and drag them along with you.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Deadly Aim|Deadly Aim]]_, _[[feats/Ranged Disarm|Ranged Disarm]]_ (Ranged Tactics Toolbox 8), base attack bonus +6, weapon _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ class feature with a ranged weapon.

**Benefit:** You don't take the -2 penalty for attempting disarm combat maneuver checks with a ranged weapon using _Ranged Disarm_, and you can attempt a stealAPG combat maneuver check instead of a disarm combat maneuver check when using _Ranged Disarm_. In addition, when you successfully disarm or steal an item from an opponent, that item is deposited in that opponent's square. For every 5 by which your attack exceeds the target's CMD, you can deposit the item 5 feet away from the target (to a maximum of the attack's maximum range or until your projectile strikes an object that it cannot penetrate). If you use this ability with a thrown weapon and have the _[[feats/Ricochet Toss|Ricochet Toss]]_ feat, both the weapon and the item return to you.
