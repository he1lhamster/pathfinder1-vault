# Threnodic Spell (Metamagic)

You can convert mind-affecting magic to necromantic power capable of controlling undead.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (religion) 6 ranks, _[[feats/Spell Focus|Spell Focus]]_ (necromancy).

**Benefit:** This feat only works on mind-affecting spells. A _[[feats/Threnodic Spell|threnodic spell]]_ affects undead creatures (even mindless undead) as if they weren't immune to mind-affecting effects, but has no effect on living creatures. A _threnodic spell_ uses up a spell slot two level higher than the spell's actual level.

**Normal:** Undead are immune to mind-affecting effects.
