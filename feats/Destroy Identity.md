# Destroy Identity (Combat, Critical)

You can use your weapons to mar your opponents' most distinctive characteristics.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Critical Focus|Critical Focus]]_, base attack bonus +11, worshiper of Lamashtu.

**Benefit:** Whenever you confirm a critical hit against an opponent, in addition to dealing critical damage as normal, you maim your target so much that it takes 2 points of Charisma damage and becomes _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1 round.
