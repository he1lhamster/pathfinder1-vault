# Improved Swarm Form

You can assume the form of various varmints.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Vampire|Vampire]]_.

**Benefit:** Choose one of the following forms: bat swarm, centipede swarm, cockroach swarmB2, leech swarm, rat swarm, or spider swarm. As a standard action, you can change into this form. The swarm has the same number of hit points as you, and any damage dealt to the swarm affects you. While in swarm form, you are immune to any physical spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as _[[spells/Disintegrate|disintegrate]]_), with the exception of such spells and effects generated by you, which treat you as one single creature if you so choose. While in swarm form, you cannot use any _[[universal monster rules/Natural Attacks|natural attacks]]_ or any special attacks, although you gain the natural weapons and extraordinary special attacks of the swarm you transform into. You also retain all of your usual special qualities. While in swarm form, you are still considered an undead creature with your total number of Hit Dice. You can remain in swarm form until you assume another form, until you retake your original form as a standard action, or until the next sunrise. This is a supernatural ability.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take this feat, choose another swarm type.
