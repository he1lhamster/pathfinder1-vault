# Improved Fiendish Darkness

Your innate ability to shroud others in _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_ is further empowered.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Fiendish Darkness|Fiendish Darkness]]_, _darkness_ spell-like ability, caster level 3rd, _[[monsters/Tiefling|tiefling]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus to your effective caster level when using your _darkness_ spell-like ability. In addition, whenever you cast a spell with the evil descriptor that targets another creature, you can spend a swift action to apply the effects of your _darkness_ spell-like ability to the spell cast, with the _darkness_ effect centered on the spell's target. Using the _darkness_ spell-like ability in this way expends all three uses of it for the day, and it cannot be used if fewer than three uses of it remain for that day.
