# Ascendant Spell (Metamagic)

You have learned how to emulate mythic spells using non-mythic forces.

**Benefit:** You can modify a spell to imitate the mythic version of that spell. An _[[feats/Ascendant Spell|ascendant spell]]_ uses the mythic version of the spell, but doesn't count as a mythic spell for the purposes of effects that interact with the spell, unless you are a mythic creature. You can't use the augmented version of the mythic spell, or use spells effects that require you to _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ uses of mythic power (even if you have uses of mythic power available). An _ascendant spell_ uses up a spell slot 5 levels higher than the spell's actual level.
