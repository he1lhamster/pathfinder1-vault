# Draining Strike (Combat)

With a well-aimed strike, you cause your target to become _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_ or _[[conditions/Exhausted|exhausted]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, Wis 13, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit:** You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). _[[feats/Draining Strike|Draining Strike]]_ forces a foe that was damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. An opponent who fails this saving throw is _fatigued_ for 1 minute or until the foe is subject to any spell or effect that heals hit point damage. If you have a base attack bonus of +14 or higher, the target is _exhausted_ for the same duration instead. You can attempt to use _Draining Strike_ once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but you can use it no more than once per round. Constructs, _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ creatures, plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected by this ability.
