# Fascinated By The Mundane (Story)

Your perspective of normality is slightly skewed, and you are easily awed by things such as commonplace tools or mundane activities. You struggle to find your place in a world that seems continually poised to _[[feats/Overwhelm|overwhelm]]_ your senses.

**Prerequisites:** You must have a fey ancestor somewhere in your family line, and you must have the Adopted by the Fey, Fey Meeting, or Met a Fantastic Creature background (Ultimate Campaign 21, 30, and 24, respectively).

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on Charisma-based ability checks and skill checks other than Diplomacy checks.

**Goal:** You must succeed at your saving throws against five different spells with the emotionUM descriptor or attempts to apply the _[[conditions/Fascinated|fascinated]]_ condition to you.

**Completion Benefit:** Your ever-present awe is under your control. Your bonus on Charisma-based skill checks now also applies on your Diplomacy checks. You can increase any morale bonus you receive by 1.
