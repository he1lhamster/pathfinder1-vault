# Ascetic Form (Combat)

You have mastered the ability to _[[spells/Blend|blend]]_ the use of arms with martial arts.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Ascetic Style|Ascetic Style]]_; _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ with the chosen melee weapon; base attack bonus +5 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 5th.

**Benefit:** You can use the chosen melee weapon with any class ability that can be used with an unarmed strike, such as an unchained _monk_'s style strike ability. In addition, you are treated as a _monk_ with a level equal to your character level for the purpose of determining the number of times per day that you can use feats with uses per day that depend upon your _monk_ level, such as the _[[feats/Stunning Fist|Stunning Fist]]_ or _[[feats/Perfect Strike|Perfect Strike]]_ feats.
