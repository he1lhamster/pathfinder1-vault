# Extra Wild Talent

You gain an additional wild talent.

**Prerequisites:** _[[classes/Kineticist|Kineticist]]_ level 6th.

**Benefit:** You gain a wild talent that's at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level wild talent you can currently use. You can select an infusion or a non-infusion wild talent, but not a blast or defense wild talent. If you have the expanded element class feature, you can select a wild talent from any of your elements that's at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level wild talent from your primary element that you can currently use.

**Special:** You can take this feat multiple times. Each time, you must choose a different wild talent.
