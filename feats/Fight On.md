# Fight On

You can keep fighting even after you should be dead.

**Prerequisites:** Con 13; dwarf, half-orc, or _[[monsters/Orc|orc]]_.

**Benefit:** Once per day, you can gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. You can activate this feat as an immediate action when reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. You can use this feat to prevent yourself from _[[conditions/Dying|dying]]_. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute. If your hit points drop below 0 due to the loss of these temporary hit points, you fall _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_ and are _dying_ as normal. If you also have the _[[universal monster rules/Ferocity|ferocity]]_ racial trait, you can use that once you have lost the temporary hit points from this feat.
