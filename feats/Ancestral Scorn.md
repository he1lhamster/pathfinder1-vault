# Ancestral Scorn

The fury you harbor for your fiendish ancestors gives evil outsiders great reason to _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ you.

**Prerequisites:** Intimidate 5 ranks, _[[monsters/Tiefling|tiefling]]_.

**Benefit:** Whenever you successfully demoralize an outsider of the evil subtype with an Intimidate check, it becomes _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ for 1 round in addition to being affected by the normal effects of being demoralized. If you beat the DC by 5 or more, the creature is _[[conditions/Nauseated|nauseated]]_ for 1 round instead.

**Normal:** Demoralizing a foe with a successful Intimidate check causes it to become _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 1 round, +1 round for every 5 by which you beat the DC.
