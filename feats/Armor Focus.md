# Armor Focus (Combat)

Your familiarity with a specific type of armor increases the amount of protection you receive from it.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +1, proficiency with selected armor.

**Benefit:** Select one type of armor, such as _[[items/Armor/Chain shirt|chain shirt]]_ or _[[items/Armor/Splint mail|splint mail]]_. The AC bonus granted by the selected armor increases by 1.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of armor. The _[[feats/Armor Focus|Armor Focus]]_ feat counts as the armor _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ class feature for the purpose of armor mastery feat prerequisites and determines what types of armor you can use with armor mastery feats.
