# Diviner's Delving

Your _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Keen|keen]]_ magical intuition makes reading signs, portents, and mystical clues quick and easy.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Spell Focus|Spell Focus]]_ (_[[spells/Divination|divination]]_).

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks with divinations to overcome _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ or effects that impede _divination_ (for example, _[[spells/Nondetection|nondetection]]_). When using a _divination_ spell that requires concentration, you gain information from the spell 1 round sooner than normal (so you gain information from the first 2 rounds with 1 round of concentration, and information from the third round in the second round of concentration).
