# Dimensional Step Up

Even teleportation cannot keep you from confronting your foe.

**Prerequisites:** Dimensional AgilityUC, _[[feats/Step Up|Step Up]]_, base attack bonus +12, abundant step class feature or ability to cast _[[spells/Dimension Door|dimension door]]_.

**Benefit:** Once per day, when an adjacent foe moves using a teleportation spell, spell-like ability, or similar ability (including effects like a shadowdancer's _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|shadow]]_ _[[spells/Jump|jump]]_ ability), you can follow the creature as an immediate action. This ability has no range limit; you simply appear adjacent to the target wherever its destination happens to be. You cannot use this ability to travel to another plane. This feat does not provide you any means of returning, nor does it grant you knowledge of where your foe is going.
