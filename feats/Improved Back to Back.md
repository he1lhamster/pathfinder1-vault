# Improved Back to Back (Teamwork)

After much practice, you and an ally have become adept at fighting in close proximity to one another.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Back to Back|Back to Back]]_, Perception 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** While you are adjacent to an ally who is flanked and also has this feat, you can spend a swift action to gain a +2 bonus to AC against all flankers until the start of your next turn.
