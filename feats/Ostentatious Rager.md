# Ostentatious Rager (Combat)

You can _[[spells/Enthrall|enthrall]]_ onlookers with a show of ferocious might or compel enemies to regard you as a crucial threat.

**Prerequisites:** Intimidate 5 ranks, _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ class feature.

**Benefit:** You can earn money with Intimidate by performing feats of strength and intimidation, exactly as if you were doing so with the Perform skill. Additionally, while you're raging, if a foe would be demoralized by your Intimidate skill and the foe is not currently _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ by your intimidation, you can instead distract that foe until the beginning of your next turn. During that time, the foe takes a -5 penalty on Perception checks that don't involve you and takes a -2 penalty to its AC against any creature other than you. These effects end early if a creature other than you attacks the foe or if you demoralize the foe and apply the _shaken_ condition.
