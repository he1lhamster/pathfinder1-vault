# Practiced Dreamer

Your time in the Dimension of Dreams has improved your ability to manipulate its landscape.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 15, Lucid DreamerOA, Knowledge (planes) 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** Once per day, you can reroll a failed attempt to perform an impossible action, such as casting a spell you can't normally cast, gaining an effect of a spell as if it had been cast, or conjuring a magic item. You also gain an additional +2 bonus on Charisma checks to determine your initial condition when entering a _[[spells/Dream|dream]]_ with your lucid body.
