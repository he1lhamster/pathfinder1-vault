# Brain Eater

You gain some of the skills and knowledge of a consumed foe by eating its brain.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Ghoul|Ghoul]]_, Intelligence 17.

**Benefit:** If you eat a portion of the brain of a creature with Intelligence 3 or higher, you gain a +2 insight bonus on all skill checks and Will saving throws for 1 hour. Eating a brain is a full-round action, and the target must be dead or _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_. If the target is living, you may attempt to eat its brain as a coup de _[[spells/Grace|grace]]_ attack on the target, but you gain the insight bonus only if your attempt results in the victim's death.
