# Sickening Spell (Metamagic)

You can sicken creatures with your spells.

**Benefit:** You can modify a spell to sicken a creature damaged by the spell. When a creature takes damage from this spell, they become _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the sickening effect. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can make a Fortitude save to negate the sickening effect. If the spell effect also causes the creature to become _sickened_, the duration of this metamagic effect is added on to the duration of the spell. A _[[feats/Sickening Spell|sickening spell]]_ uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level. Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.
