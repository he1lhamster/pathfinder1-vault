# Curse Of Vengeance

Your deity lays curses upon those who wrong you.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to cast at least one spell or spell-like ability with the curse descriptor, worshiper of Calistria.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are rendered _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ or a creature kills you, you can cast a single spell or spell-like ability with the curse descriptor as an immediate action before you become _helpless_ or are killed. The curse must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less and must target the creature who rendered you _helpless_ or who killed you. If the curse has a range of touch and the attacker is not within your reach, you can deliver it as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet.
