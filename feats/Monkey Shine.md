# Monkey Shine (Combat)

You combine acrobatics and opportunity to devastating effect against your opponent.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 13, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Monkey Moves|Monkey Moves]]_, _[[feats/Monkey Style|Monkey Style]]_, _[[feats/Stunning Fist|Stunning Fist]]_, Acrobatics 11 ranks, Climb 11 ranks.

**Benefit:** While using _Monkey Style_, if you successfully deliver a _Stunning Fist_ attempt, in addition to the normal effect of _Stunning Fist_, you can spend a free action to enter a square adjacent to you that is within your opponent's space. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. While you are in your opponent's space, you gain a +4 _[[feats/Dodge|dodge]]_ bonus to AC and a +4 bonus on melee attack rolls against that opponent. If otherwise unhindered, the opponent can move away from you, but if he does, he provokes an attack of opportunity from you even if his choice of movement does not normally do so.

**Normal:** You cannot enter an opponent's space.
