# Greater Blighted Critical (Critical)

Your critical hit from a spell or spell-like ability afflicts the target with a major spellblight.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Blighted Critical|Blighted Critical]]_, caster level 12th.

**Benefit:** Whenever you confirm a critical hit with a touch spell, ranged touch spell, or spell-like ability against an opponent, the victim gains a random major spellblight (see page 96).

**Special:** You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess _[[feats/Critical Mastery|Critical Mastery]]_.
