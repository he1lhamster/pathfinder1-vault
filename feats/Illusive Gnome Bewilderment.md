# Illusive Gnome Bewilderment (Combat)

You can use your gnome weapons in unusual ways.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, Gnome Weapon FocusARG, _[[feats/Illusive Gnome Style|Illusive Gnome Style]]_, _[[feats/Illusive Gnome Surprise|Illusive Gnome Surprise]]_, _[[feats/Improved Feint|Improved Feint]]_, gnome magic and weapon familiarity racial traits.

**Benefit:** While using _Illusive Gnome Style_, when you successfully use Bluff to feint against an opponent, you can pick one special weapon feature from among those listed by _Illusive Gnome Surprise_ and deny the opponent its Dexterity modifier to AC, as normal for feinting; alternatively, you can pick two special weapon features instead of one.
