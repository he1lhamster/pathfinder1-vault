# Paralyzing Strike (Combat)

Finding just the right pressure point, you paralyze your foe with a single hit.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, Wis 13, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +14.

**Benefit:** You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). _[[feats/Paralyzing Strike|Paralyzing Strike]]_ forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A defender who fails this saving throw is _[[conditions/Paralyzed|paralyzed]]_ for 1 round, until just before your next turn. You can attempt to use _Paralyzing Strike_ once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but no more than once per round. Constructs, _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ creatures, plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected by this ability.
