# Divine Protection

Your deity protects you against _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ attacks.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, Knowledge (religion) 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** Once per day as an immediate action before rolling a saving throw, you can add your Charisma modifier on that saving throw. As usual, this does not stack if you already apply your Charisma modifier to that saving throw. If you possess the charmed life class feature, you can instead apply _[[feats/Divine Protection|Divine Protection]]_'s bonus after rolling the saving throw but before the result is revealed.
