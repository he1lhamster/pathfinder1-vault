# Perfect Strike (Combat)

When wielding a _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ weapon, your attacks can be extremely precise.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, Wis 13, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit:** You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). You must use one of the following weapons to make the attack: _[[items/Weapon/Kama|kama]]_, _[[items/Weapon/Nunchaku|nunchaku]]_, _[[items/Weapon/Quarterstaff|quarterstaff]]_, _[[items/Weapon/Sai|sai]]_, and _[[items/Weapon/Siangham|siangham]]_. You can roll your attack roll twice and take the higher result. If one of these rolls is a critical threat, the other roll is used as your confirmation roll (your choice if they are both critical threats). You may attempt a perfect attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round.

**Special:** A weapon master _monk_ or zen archer _monk_ receives _[[feats/Perfect Strike|Perfect Strike]]_ as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A _monk_ may attempt an _perfect strike_ attack a number of times per day equal to his _monk_ level, plus one more time per day for every four levels he has in classes other than _monk_.
