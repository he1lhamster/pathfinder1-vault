# Taunt

You may be small, but your remarks cut others down to size.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, Small size or smaller.

**Benefit:** You can demoralize opponents using Bluff rather than Intimidate (see the Intimidate skill description for details) and take no skill check penalty for being smaller than your target.
