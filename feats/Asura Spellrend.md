# Asura Spellrend (Combat)

Your blasphemies _[[spells/Shatter|shatter]]_ divine magic.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Asura Sight|Asura Sight]]_*, _[[feats/Asura Style|Asura Style]]_*, base attack bonus +13 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 13th.

**Benefit:** You can replace one of your attacks at your highest base attack bonus each round with a _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Spellrending|spellrending]]_ strike. If your _spellrending_ strike hits, it deals no damage, but you can attempt to dispel a harmless divine spell affecting this target as per _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_, with a caster level equal to your character level. If you succeed at your dispel check, the target is _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ as if you had interrupted the spell with _Asura Style_ and receives no saving throw to reduce the _sickened_ duration.
