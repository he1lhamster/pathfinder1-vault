# Owl Dive (Combat)

Your martial _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ helps you fly and _[[feats/Charge Through|charge through]]_ others' spaces.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 17, _[[feats/Owl Style|Owl Style]]_, _[[feats/Owl Swoop|Owl Swoop]]_, _[[feats/Skill Focus|Skill Focus]]_ (Stealth), base attack bonus +7 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 5th, Acrobatics 1 rank, Fly 1 rank, Stealth 1 rank.

**Benefit:** While using _Owl Style_, you can use your base attack bonus in place of your ranks in Fly to determine your Fly skill bonus. You can _charge through_ other creatures' spaces, but you must make a successful Acrobatics check to move through enemy spaces, as normal. If you fail an Acrobatics check to move through an enemy's space during a charge, your charge stops just before you enter that enemy's space; if you threaten that foe, you can make your charge attack against that foe.
