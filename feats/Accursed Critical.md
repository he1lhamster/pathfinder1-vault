# Accursed Critical (Critical)

Your spells carry an embedded curse that manifests when they _[[feats/Strike True|strike true]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Critical Focus|Critical Focus]]_, ability to cast _[[spells/Bestow Curse|bestow curse]]_ or major curse, caster level 9th.

**Benefit:** When you confirm a critical hit with a spell or spell-like ability, you may cast _bestow curse_ or major curse on that target as an immediate action. This works even with ranged spells. You must have _bestow curse_ or major curse prepared or otherwise available to cast, and using this ability casts the corresponding spell.
