# No Name (Grit)

You don't need an elaborate disguise to keep your identity under wraps.

**Prerequisites:** Grit class feature or _[[feats/Amateur Gunslinger|Amateur Gunslinger]]_ feat, Bluff 4 ranks.

**Benefit:** You often rely on surprise and _[[spells/Misdirection|misdirection]]_ in your social dealings. You gain a +2 bonus on Bluff checks, and you can spend 1 grit point to gain a +10 bonus on Disguise checks for 10 minutes per your _[[classes/Gunslinger|gunslinger]]_ level (minimum 10 minutes). This deed does not actually change your appearance, but rather allows you to hide your identity in other ways.
