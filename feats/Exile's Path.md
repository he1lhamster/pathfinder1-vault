# Exile's Path

A lifetime spent shunned by others and eschewing your heritage makes you resistant to efforts to pry inside of your mind.

**Prerequisites:** Half-elf.

**Benefit:** Once per day, when you fail a Will save against an enchantment spell or effect, you may reroll that saving throw, but must take the reroll result even if it's worse.
