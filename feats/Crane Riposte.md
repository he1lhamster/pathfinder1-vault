# Crane Riposte (Combat)

You use your defensive abilities to make overpowering counterattacks.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Crane Style|Crane Style]]_, _[[feats/Crane Wing|Crane Wing]]_, _[[feats/Dodge|Dodge]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +8 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 7th.

**Benefit:** You take only a -1 penalty on attack rolls for fighting defensively. Whenever you deflect an opponent's attack using _Crane Wing_ or lose the doge bonus from _Crane Wing_ because an attack missed you by 4 or less, you can make an attack of opportunity against the attacker after the attack misses.
