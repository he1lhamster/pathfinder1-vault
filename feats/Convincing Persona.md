# Convincing Persona

People seem almost willfully ignorant of the connection between your masked persona and your real identity.

**Prerequisites:** Bluff 5 ranks, Perform (act) 5 ranks, or dual identityUI class feature.

**Benefit:** Your dual identity is never considered publicly compromised barring some massive, public unmasking, allowing you to benefit from your dual identity or masked persona regardless of how many people know your true identity. You gain a +5 circumstance bonus on Bluff skill checks to convince people your masked persona and your true identity are entirely different people, and on Disguise checks to maintain your masked persona.
