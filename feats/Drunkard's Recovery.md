# Drunkard's Recovery

You need only a swallow of strong drink to bring you back from the brink of death.

**Prerequisites:** Con 13.

**Benefit:** If you are _[[conditions/Dying|dying]]_ and a creature gives you at least a sip of alcohol (a standard action for an adjacent creature), you immediately stabilize.
