# Dimensional Disruption (Combat)

You've become so adept at combating summoned creatures that you can interrupt the magical energies that _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ them to your plane.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Arcane Strike|Arcane Strike]]_ or _[[feats/Disruptive|Disruptive]]_; _[[feats/Banishing Critical|Banishing Critical]]_; _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_; _[[feats/Dimensional Awareness|Dimensional Awareness]]_; Spellcraft 8 ranks; arcane pool class feature.

**Benefit:** When you use _Dimensional Awareness_ to make an attack of opportunity against a creature being summoned or called into a square you threaten, you can additionally use an immediate action to attempt to send the creature back to its home plane. Attempt a Spellcraft check (DC = 15 + the creature's CR [minimum 1] + the spell level of the spell that summoned the creature). If you succeed, the creature does not get to act and is immediately sent back to its home plane.

**Normal:** A summoning or calling spell can be disrupted only by a failed concentration check or by _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Countering|countering]]_ the spell.
