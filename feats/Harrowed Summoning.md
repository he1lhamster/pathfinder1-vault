# Harrowed Summoning

Your summoned creatures are empowered by the magic of the harrow.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Harrowed|Harrowed]]_ (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 287).

**Benefit:** When you cast a conjuration (summoning) spell or use a spell-like ability to _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ one or more creatures, you can draw two random _[[items/Mundane/Cards|cards]]_ from a complete _[[items/Mundane/Harrow deck|harrow deck]]_ you own. Doing so adds both a somatic component (if the spell does not already have one) and a focus component (the _harrow deck_) to the spell, but does not increase the spell's casting time. For the duration of the spell, each summoned creature gains a +4 enhancement bonus to the corresponding ability scores of the drawn card's suits. If both _cards_ are the same suit, each summoned creature gains a +6 bonus to that ability score instead. If either card's alignment is a true match for the summoned creatures' alignment, the duration of the spell is doubled, while drawing an opposite match halves the duration of the spell. If both a true match and an opposite match are drawn, the spell's duration is unchanged. A creature summoned in this way is distinctly altered by the _cards_ drawn. Its physical appearance ref lects the visual elements of the _cards_ (for example, a creature summoned with The Publican might have only one eye). The creature's personality is also inf luenced by the _cards_, but not so much as to alter its alignment (for example, The _[[items/Weapon/Snakebite|Snakebite]]_ might _summon_ a creature that likes to gossip).
