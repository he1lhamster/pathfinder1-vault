# Flaying Critical (Combat, Critical)

Your critical hits weaken your opponents' defenses.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Critical Focus|Critical Focus]]_, base attack bonus +11.

**Benefit:** Whenever you score a critical hit, your opponent takes a -1 penalty to its natural armor bonus for the duration of the encounter. This penalty is cumulative, but cannot reduce an opponent's natural armor bonus below 0.
