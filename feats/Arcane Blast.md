# Arcane Blast

You can convert any spell into an attack.

**Prerequisites:** Arcane spellcaster, caster level 10th.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can _[[spells/Sacrifice|sacrifice]]_ a prepared spell or unused spell slot of 1st level or higher and transform it into a ray, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. This attack deals 2d6 points of damage plus an additional 1d6 points of damage for every level of the spell or spell slot you sacrificed. 0-level spells may not be sacrificed in this manner.
