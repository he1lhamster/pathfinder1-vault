# Shadow Magic Defense

Your mastery of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|shadow]]_ allows you to defend against _shadow_ magic used against you.

**Prerequisites:** _[[spells/Disguise Self|Disguise self]]_ racial spell-like ability or _shadow_ illusion shadowdancer prestige class feature.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ with the shadowUM descriptor or spells and _spell-like abilities_ of the illusion (_shadow_) subschool. If you succeed at a saving throw against an illusion (_shadow_) spell that deals a percentage of its damage or effect against creatures that successfully save against it, reduce the amount of damage it deals to you by 20% (to a minimum of 0%).
