# Voice of the Sibyl

Your voice is strangely compelling.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 15.

**Benefit:** You get a +1 bonus on all Bluff, Diplomacy, and Perform (oratory) skill checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in one of these skills, the bonus increases to +3 for that skill. You do not get these bonuses if you do not use your voice when using the skill (such as using Bluff to feint in combat).
