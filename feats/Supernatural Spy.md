# Supernatural Spy (Story)

Your familiarity with magic drives you to discover a great supernatural secret. You might work with an eldritch organization, which could be a school of magic such as the Arcanamirium or part of a government with strong ties to magic such as that of Irrisen, or you might attempt to keep your magical inquiries hidden from your employers.

**Prerequisites:** _[[classes/Alchemist|Alchemist]]_ discovery, arcane discovery, _[[classes/Arcanist|arcanist]]_ exploit, or _[[classes/Magus|magus]]_ arcana class feature and you must either have observed a created magical effect you could not understand or have the Master CraftsmanUCA or the Unquenchable Hunger for KnowledgeUCA background.

**Benefit:** Treat your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score as 2 higher for the purpose of calculating the effects and save DCs of one of the following class features: _alchemist_ discoveries, arcane discoveries, _arcanist_ exploits, or _magus_ arcana. You select both the ability score and class feature to be affected when you select this feat, and the choice cannot be changed. This increases the potency of the abilities but does not grant access to additional abilities.

**Goal:** Learn a great supernatural secret, connected in some manner to an aspect of the class feature you selected with this story feat. You must evade or thwart a challenging foe in the process.

**Completion Benefit:** When calculating the effect of the class feature selected with this feat, you treat your class level for the relevant class as 2 higher. This does not _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Impact|impact]]_ when you gain access to additional abilities tied to that class feature, only the effectiveness of abilities from the feature you already have.
