# Greater Meditation Master (Meditation)

You are able to glean insight from your momentary meditation longer than most.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 15, _[[feats/Combat Meditation|Combat Meditation]]_*, _[[feats/Meditation Master|Meditation Master]]_*, character level 11th.

**Benefit:** When you meditate, you gain a +2 insight bonus instead of a +1 insight bonus. You can _[[universal monster rules/Split|split]]_ this bonus between any two d20 rolls made over the duration of the feat that you used to meditate, adding +1 to each d20 roll, or using the full bonus on any one d20 roll, adding +2 to that single roll.
