# Ammo Drop (Combat)

Your coordination is so perfect that you can simply drop ammunition from your hand at the exact moment required for it to fall into an open _[[items/Weapon/Sling|sling]]_ as your twirl it around.

**Prerequisites:** Sleight of Hand 1 rank, proficient with _sling_.

**Benefit:** You can load a _sling_ or one end of a double _sling_ with one hand as a swift action or move action. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
