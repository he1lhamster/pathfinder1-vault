# Charnel Soldiers

The mindless undead you command fight together like seasoned warriors.

**Prerequisites:** Any teamwork feat, ability to control or _[[spells/Create Undead|create undead]]_.

**Benefit:** When you _create undead_, they gain one teamwork feat you know as a bonus feat, though they gain its benefits only when cooperating with you or with other undead that you have created. If you _[[spells/Control Undead|control undead]]_ with the _[[spells/Command Undead|Command Undead]]_ feat or a spell like _command undead_, they likewise gain one teamwork feat you know as a bonus feat as long as they remain under your control. Intelligent undead gain no benefit from this feat.
