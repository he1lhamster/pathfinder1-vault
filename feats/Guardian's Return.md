# Guardian's Return (Familiar)

Your familiar can teleport to you when you're in need.

**Prerequisites:** Must have a familiar with the protector archetype (see page 11).

**Benefit:** Once per day when you take damage from a melee attack, as long as your familiar is within empathic link range, it can teleport back to your square as an immediate action. It can bring no more than 5 pounds of items with it when it teleports in this way. This ability otherwise functions as _[[spells/Dimension Door|dimension door]]_.
