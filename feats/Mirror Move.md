# Mirror Move (Combat)

By tracking an opponent's movements, you can attempt to duplicate his techniques.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit:** If you are the only character threatening an opponent and that opponent uses a combat feat (including taking an action that benefits from a combat feat, or gaining any bonus to AC, attack rolls, damage rolls, or saving throws from a combat feat), you can take an immediate action to gain the benefit of that feat until the end of your next turn. You must meet all the feat's prerequisites. If a feat has a daily use limitation, as does _[[feats/Stunning Fist|Stunning Fist]]_, any uses of that feat while you're using _[[feats/Mirror Move|Mirror Move]]_ count toward that feat's daily limit for you. You can use _Mirror Move_ once per day for every 4 levels you have attained.
