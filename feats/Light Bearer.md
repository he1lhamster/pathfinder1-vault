# Light Bearer

You _[[npcs/Recruit|recruit]]_ a torchbearer who joins you on your adventures to help illuminate even the darkest dungeons.

**Prerequisites:** Character level 4th.

**Benefit:** This feat is similar to the _[[feats/Leadership|Leadership]]_ feat, with several exceptions. You can attract only a 1st-level cohort (referred to hereafter as a _[[feats/Light Bearer|light bearer]]_) with this feat, and can't _recruit_ followers. You determine your _Leadership_ score according to the rules presented in the _Leadership_ feat, but your _light bearer_ is always at least 3 levels lower than your level. A _light bearer_ can take levels in alchemistAPG, _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_, or _[[classes/Rogue|rogue]]_. The _light bearer_ cannot multiclass, though he can take any archetype for which he qualifies. The radius of normal and increased illumination shed by whatever alchemical or mundane light source the _light bearer_ carries increases by 10 feet. He also gains a +4 bonus on all saving throws made against an effect that would extinguish any nonmagical (including alchemical) light source he carries. If a _light bearer_ gains enough XP to bring him to 2 levels lower than your level, he doesn't gain the new level until you gain your next level; until you advance, his XP total remains 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level. If you release your _light bearer_ from service or otherwise lose your _light bearer_, you can _recruit_ a new one. At 7th level, you can swap this feat for the _Leadership_ feat.
