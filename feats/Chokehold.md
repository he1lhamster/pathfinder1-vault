# Chokehold (Combat)

While grappling, you can cut off an opponent's air and blood supply.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +6 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 5th.

**Benefit:** While you have an opponent up to one size category larger than you _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_, you can attempt a grapple combat maneuver with a -5 penalty on the check. If you succeed, you have _[[conditions/Pinned|pinned]]_ your opponent and hold the opponent in a _[[feats/Chokehold|chokehold]]_. When you maintain the grapple, you also maintain the _chokehold_. A creature in a _chokehold_ cannot breathe or speak, and thus cannot cast spells that have a verbal component. An opponent you have in a _chokehold_ has to hold his breath or begin suffocating. Any creature that does not breathe, is immune to _[[universal monster rules/Bleed|bleed]]_ damage, or is immune to critical hits is immune to the effects of your _chokehold_. When the grapple is ended, so is the _chokehold_.
