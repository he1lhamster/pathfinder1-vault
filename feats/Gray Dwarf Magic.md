# Gray Dwarf Magic

You gain a new spell-like ability from the list of _[[monsters/Duergar|duergar]]_ racial traits.

**Prerequisites:** _Duergar_.

**Benefit:** Choose one spell-like ability that is usable once per day and is granted by a _duergar_ racial trait you don't have. You can use that spell-like ability once per day, with a caster level equal to your character level.

**Special:** You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you must select a spell-like ability that's usable once per day from a different _duergar_ racial trait.
