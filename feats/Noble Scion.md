You are a member of a proud noble family, whether or not you remain in good standing with your family.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, must be taken at 1st level.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on all Knowledge (nobility) checks, and that chosen Knowledge skill is always considered a class skill for you. When you select this feat, choose one of the benefits listed below that matches the flavor of your noble family. Work with your GM to ensure that your choice is appropriate. 
Scion of the Arts: You gain a +1 bonus on all Perform checks, and Perform is always a class skill for you. If you have the bardic performance ability, you can use that ability for an additional 3 rounds per day. 
Scion of Lore: You gain a +1 bonus on all Knowledge skills in which you have at least 1 rank. 
Scion of Magic: You gain one of the following languages as a bonus language: Abyssal, Aklo, Celestial, Draconic, Infernal, or Sylvan. Once per day, as a free action, you can gain a +2 bonus on any Spellcraft check you make. You must spend the free action to gain this bonus before you make the check. 
Scion of Peace: Whenever you take 10 on a Wisdom-based skill, treat the result as if you had rolled a 13 instead of a 10. 
Scion of War: You use your Charisma modifier to adjust Initiative checks instead of your Dexterity modifier.
