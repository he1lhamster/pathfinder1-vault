# Death's Host

You become harder to kill when possessed by the undead.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Spell Focus|Spell Focus]]_ (necromancy).

**Benefit:** Whenever you are possessed by an undead creature that you do not directly control, you gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against death effects. You don't fall _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_ at negative hit points, and if you or the undead possessing you is forced to attempt a saving throw to resist ending the _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_ effect, you or your possessor gains a +4 bonus on the saving throw.
