# False Opening (Combat)

When you make a ranged attack while threatened, you can fool your opponent into thinking he has an opening.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Dodge|Dodge]]_, Close Quarters Thrower or Point-Blank Master, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ with selected ranged weapon.

**Benefit:** Choose a ranged weapon or a thrown weapon. When you make a ranged attack using that weapon, you can choose to provoke an attack of opportunity from one or more opponents who threaten you. You gain a +4 _dodge_ bonus against such attacks. An opponent that makes such an attack and misses you loses his Dexterity bonus to AC against you until the end of your turn.
