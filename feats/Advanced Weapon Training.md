# Advanced Weapon Training (Combat)

You are specially trained to use your weapon skills in new ways.

**Prerequisites:** _[[classes/Fighter|Fighter]]_ level 5th, weapon _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ class feature.

**Benefit:** Select one _[[feats/Advanced Weapon Training|advanced weapon training]]_ option, applying it to one _fighter_ weapon group you have already selected with the weapon _training_ class feature.

**Special:** This feat can be taken more than once, but at most once per 5 _fighter_ levels. Fighters that have the weapon masterAPG archetype can select this feat beginning at 4th level. The benefits of a weapon master's _advanced weapon training_ options apply only to his selected weapon rather than all weapons in the same _fighter_ weapon group, and he can't select the weapon specialist _advanced weapon training_ option. A weapon master can select this feat as a bonus feat; if he does so, it doesn't count for the purpose of the requirement that it can be taken at most once per 5 _fighter_ levels.
