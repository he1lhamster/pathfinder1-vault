# Battle Singer

Your battle songs can drive your fellow goblins to new heights of frenzy.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Goblin|Goblin]]_, bardic performance class feature.

**Benefit:** When using bardic performance to inspire courage in allies, you can choose to sing in Goblin-allies who do not speak _Goblin_ gain no benefits from this performance. Allied goblins who hear your battle songs become more energetic and brave, and thus add the bonus granted by your inspire courage ability to all saving throws as a morale bonus.
