# Spell Mastery

You have mastered a small handful of spells, and can prepare these spells without referencing your spellbooks at all.

**Prerequisites:** 1st-level _[[classes/Wizard|wizard]]_.

**Benefit:** Each time you take this feat, choose a number of spells that you already know equal to your Intelligence modifier. From that point on, you can prepare these spells without referring to a _[[items/Mundane/Spellbook|spellbook]]_.

**Normal:** Without this feat, you must use a _spellbook_ to prepare all your spells, except _[[spells/Read Magic|read magic]]_.
