# Wyvern Wing (Combat)

Like a _[[monsters/Wyvern|wyvern]]_ on the wing, you command a fluid style that enables you to make attacks while moving.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Exotic Weapon Proficiency|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]]_ (_[[items/Weapon/Whip|whip]]_), _[[feats/Wyvern Fury Style|Wyvern Fury Style]]_, _[[feats/Wyvern Sting|Wyvern Sting]]_, Acrobatics 10 ranks, _[[classes/Brawler|brawler]]_'s flurryACG class feature or flurry of blows class feature.

**Benefit:** While using the _Wyvern_ Style feat, if you use flurry of blows or _brawler_'s flurry and take a 5-foot step, you can take an additional 5-foot step. You can take this extra 5-foot step only between two attacks in your flurry, but you can take both your 5-foot steps consecutively without making an attack between them.

**Normal:** When you take a 5-foot step, you are allowed to move only once.
