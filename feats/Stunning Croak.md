# Stunning Croak

The terrifying force of your croak disorients and debilitates your enemies.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Sonic Croak|Sonic Croak]]_*, _[[feats/Throat Pouch|Throat Pouch]]_*, _[[monsters/Boggard|boggard]]_, terrifying croak.

**Benefit:** When you use your terrifying croak ability, instead of imparting its normal effect you can choose to stun one creature within 30 feet for 1 round. If the target succeeds at a Fortitude save, it is instead _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1 round. The DC of this Fortitude save is the same as that of your terrifying croak ability.
