# Terrifying Strike

Your touch spreads _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Despair special ability, _[[monsters/Mummy|mummy]]_.

**Benefit:** Any creature struck by your slam attack must succeed at a Will save at the same DC as your despair ability or be _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 1d4 rounds. If the creature is already _shaken_, _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_, or _[[conditions/Panicked|panicked]]_, it is _[[conditions/Paralyzed|paralyzed]]_ for 1 round instead. This is a mind-affecting _fear_ effect.
