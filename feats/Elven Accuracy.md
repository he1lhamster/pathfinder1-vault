# Elven Accuracy (Combat)

Your sharp eyesight makes difficult shots easier.

**Prerequisites:** Elf.

**Benefit:** If you miss due to concealment when making a ranged attack with a _[[items/Weapon/Longbow|longbow]]_ or _[[items/Weapon/Shortbow|shortbow]]_ (including composite bows), you can reroll your miss chance roll one time to see if you actually hit.
