# Dragonslayer (Combat)

You have been trained to fight dragons.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks, base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit:** Whenever you confirm a critical hit against an opponent that has a _[[universal monster rules/Breath Weapon|breath weapon]]_, you can forgo the extra critical damage to instead prevent your foe from using its _breath weapon_ for a number of rounds equal to twice the critical multiplier of your attack, in addition to any normal delay mentioned in the _breath weapon_ effect's description.
