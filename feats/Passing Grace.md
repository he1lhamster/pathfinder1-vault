# Passing Grace (Teamwork)

Your bond with your allies allows you to share positive energy between yourselves.

**Benefit:** Whenever a healing spell or an effect would restore you to above your maximum hit points, you can redirect excess hit points to an adjacent ally who has this feat. This ability functions only for effects that require an action to activate-fast healing, _[[universal monster rules/Regeneration|regeneration]]_, and other passive effects that restore hit points are not shared.
