# Prophet (Story)

The truth has been revealed, and you have been chosen to deliver it.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to cast divine spells, and you must either have received a _[[spells/Vision|vision]]_ from your god (or another appropriate supernatural entity) or have the Marked by the Gods background.

**Benefit:** If you are nonevil and worship a nonevil deity, whenever you cast a beneficial spell on an ally you gain a +1 _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sacred|sacred]]_ bonus to AC for 1 round per spell level. If you are evil or worship an evil deity, whenever you cast a harmful spell on an enemy you gain a +1 profane bonus to AC for 1 round per spell level. Casting a spell on yourself does not count unless it also affects an ally.

**Goal:** Convert an appropriate number of creatures to the worship of your deity.

**Completion Benefit:** Your bonus to AC for casting beneficial or harmful spells on allies increases to +2, and the bonus also applies on saving throws for the same duration.
