# Evolved Summoned Monster

The creatures you _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ have evolved to have even greater abilities.

**Prerequisites:** Augmented Summoning, _[[feats/Spell Focus|Spell Focus]]_ (conjuration), ability to cast _[[spells/Summon Monster I|summon monster I]]_.

**Benefit:** Each time you cast a _summon_ monster spell, you can select a 1-point evolution other than _[[universal monster rules/Pounce|pounce]]_ or reach from those available to a _[[classes/Summoner|summoner]]_'s eidolon. Your summoned creature gains this evolution. The summoned creature must conform to any limitations of the evolution. (For instance, only a creature with a reach of 10 feet or greater can have the _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ evolution.) Evolutions that grant additional attacks or enhance existing attacks can be applied only to _[[classes/Medium|Medium]]_ or larger summoned creatures. If you _summon_ more than one creature with a single spell, only one creature gains the evolution.

**Special:** You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, select an additional 1-point evolution for one of your summoned creatures. If you _summon_ more than one creature, you can apply all the chosen evolutions to a single summoned creature or _[[universal monster rules/Split|split]]_ them between the creatures.
