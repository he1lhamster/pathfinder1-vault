# Invoke Primal Instinct

You can use your ability to take the shape of an animal to enhance your Bluff skill, giving yourself an aura of danger or meekness that influences nearby creatures into doing what you want.

**Prerequisites:** Bluff 1 rank, wild shape class feature, gnome.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can pantomime or describe predator- or prey-like behavior, _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ one of your uses of wild shape, and make a Bluff check. All creatures within 30 feet that fail a Will save against your Bluff check DC regard you as a figure of either _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ or contempt (your choice applies to all affected creatures). If you choose _fear_, the targets are _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_ for 1 round per _[[classes/Druid|druid]]_ level. If you choose contempt, the targets consider you harmless for 1 minute, ignoring you unless you attack them or take a threatening action.
