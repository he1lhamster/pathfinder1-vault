# Sweeping Dodge (Combat)

A quick sweep of your cloak def lects an incoming attack.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Dodge|Dodge]]_.

**Benefit:** When you make a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Dueling|dueling]]_ _dodge_ while wearing a cloak, you gain evasion (as the _[[classes/Rogue|rogue]]_ ability). If a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on you, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. This feat only applies until the attack that triggered the immediate action is resolved. This feat does not stack with the _[[universal monster rules/Fortification|fortification]]_ armor special ability or similar effects.
