# Channeling Scourge

Your zeal for hunting your faith's enemies empowers your ability to channel divine energy, as long as you channel that energy for _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Channel energy class feature, _[[classes/Inquisitor|inquisitor]]_ level 1st.

**Benefit:** When you use channel energy to deal damage, your _inquisitor_ levels count as _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ levels for determining the number of damage dice and the saving throw DC.
