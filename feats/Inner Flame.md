# Inner Flame (Combat)

Your body generates so much _[[universal monster rules/Heat|heat]]_ that your mere touch scorches your enemies.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Scorching Weapons|Scorching Weapons]]_, character level 7th, _[[monsters/Ifrit|ifrit]]_.

**Benefit:** Your bonus on saves against fire attacks and spells with the fire descriptor or light descriptor increases to +4. When you use _Scorching Weapons_, the affected weapons deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage instead of 1, and when you are grappling, you deal this damage to your grappling opponent on your turn.
