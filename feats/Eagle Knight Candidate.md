# Eagle Knight Candidate (Achievement)

You have proven your courage and skill to both the _[[monsters/Eagle|Eagle]]_ Knights and the leaders of Andoran.

**Prerequisites:** Character level 5th, convince four different _Eagle_ Knights and either a member of the People's Council or an Andoran town _[[npcs/Mayor|mayor]]_ to write letters of commendation on your behalf.

**Benefit:** Choose one branch of the _Eagle_ Knights you hope to join. You gain a specific benefit based on this choice. 
Golden Legion: Each round as a move action, you may issue commands to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear you. Each affected ally that obeys your orders gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls, Armor Class, and saving throws during that round. 
Steel Falcons: You deal +1 damage with weapon attacks directed at any creature against which you have concealment. If you have total concealment against the creature, this bonus increases to +2. 
Twilight Talons: During the surprise round, the threat range of your weapons doubles for any attack made against unaware targets. This does not stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon.
