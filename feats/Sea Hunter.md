# Sea Hunter (Combat)

Your blows _[[spells/Knock|knock]]_ swimming opponents off balance.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[monsters/Merfolk|merfolk]]_.

**Benefit:** When you make a successful melee attack against a swimming target, as a free action you can attempt to _knock_ the target off balance. Treat this as a _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ combat maneuver. If you succeed, the target is considered off balance (see Table 13-7: Combat Adjustments _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|Underwater]]_ on page 433 of the Core Rulebook) until it recovers its balance, usually by making a Swim check on its turn. This feat has no effect on creatures with a swim speed, those using magic such as _[[spells/Freedom of Movement|freedom of movement]]_, and creatures that can't be tripped.
