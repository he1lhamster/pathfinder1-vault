# Draconic Breath

You possess draconic defenses and a _[[universal monster rules/Breath Weapon|breath weapon]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Draconic Aspect|Draconic Aspect]]_, _[[monsters/Kobold|kobold]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus against sleep and _[[universal monster rules/Paralysis|paralysis]]_ effects. You gain a _breath weapon_ that is determined by your scale coloration by either the _Draconic Aspect_ feat or the dragon-scaled racial trait. Using a _breath weapon_ is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You can use your _breath weapon_ once per day. Creatures within the area of your _breath weapon_ who succeed at a Ref lex saving throw (DC 10 + your character level + your Constitution modif ier) take only half damage. Black (Su): You breathe a 30-foot line of acid that deals 2d6 points of acid damage. Blue (Su): You breathe a 30-foot line of electricity that deals 2d6 points of electricity damage. Green (Su): You breathe a 15-foot cone of acid that deals 2d6 points of acid damage. Red (Su): You breathe a 15-foot cone of fire that deals 2d6 points of fire damage. White (Su): You breathe a 15-foot _[[spells/Cone of Cold|cone of cold]]_ that deals 2d6 points of cold damage.

**Special:** _Kobold_ sorcerers with either the draconic or _kobold_ bloodline can use their Charisma modifier instead of their Constitution to determine the DC of this _breath weapon_.
