**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Hurtful|Hurtful]]_, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_.

**Benefit:** Once per round when you damage a creature that is _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_, _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_, or _[[conditions/Panicked|panicked]]_, you can choose to deal half your normal damage in order to extend the duration of its _fear_ condition by 1 round.
