# Smashing Style (Combat, Style)

Your _[[items/Mundane/Hammer|hammer]]_ blows dent armor, hampering your opponent.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Improved Sunder|Improved Sunder]]_, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ with the chosen weapon.

**Benefit:** Choose one weapon from the axes, hammers, or flails _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_ weapon group. While using this style, when you succeed at a sunder combat maneuver check against a suit of armor worn by an opponent, you can immediately attempt a bull rush or _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ combat maneuver against that target with the same combat maneuver bonus. This maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

**Special:** A character with the weapon _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ (axes, hammers, or flails) class feature can use _[[feats/Smashing Style|Smashing Style]]_ with any axe, flail, or _hammer_, respectively, in addition to the chosen weapon.
