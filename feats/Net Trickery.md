# Net Trickery (Combat)

You have become very proficient at using your _[[items/Mundane/Net|net]]_ to _[[feats/Hinder|hinder]]_ your enemies.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Exotic Weapon Proficiency|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]]_ (_net_), _[[feats/Net Adept|Net Adept]]_, _[[feats/Net Maneuvering|Net Maneuvering]]_, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** In place of one of your melee attacks, you can use your _net_ to attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver to blind an opponent (Advance Player's Guide 320). If you have an opponent _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_ in your _net_, you can attempt to _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ that opponent as long as he is within your _net_'s reach or you control the trailing rope on your _net_. You also gain a +2 bonus on drag and reposition combat maneuver checks you make using your _net_.
