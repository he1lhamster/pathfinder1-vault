# Charge Through (Combat)

You can overrun enemies when charging.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Improved Overrun|Improved Overrun]]_, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** When making a charge, you can attempt to overrun one creature in the path of the charge as a free action. If you successfully overrun that creature, you can complete the charge. If the overrun is unsuccessful, the charge ends in the space directly in front of that creature.

**Normal:** You must have a clear path toward the target of your charge.
