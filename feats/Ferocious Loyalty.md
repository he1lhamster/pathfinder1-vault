# Ferocious Loyalty (Teamwork)

You have a powerful sense of responsibility for your allies.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against any foe that currently threatens an ally who also has this feat. Whenever an ally with this feat is rendered _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ or killed within 30 feet of you, you gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls for 1 minute or until the foe responsible is rendered _helpless_ or killed, whichever comes first.
