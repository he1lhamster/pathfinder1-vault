# Wounded Paw Gambit (Combat, Teamwork)

Your enemy sees you as an easy mark, but doesn't notice your allies poised to shoot.

**Prerequisites:** _[[conditions/Broken|Broken]]_ Wing GambitUC, Bluff 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** Whenever you use _[[feats/Broken Wing Gambit|Broken Wing Gambit]]_ and an opponent attacks you as a result, each ally who has this feat and is within 30 feet of that opponent can attempt a ranged attack against it as an immediate action. The ally's ranged weapon must be in hand, loaded, and ready to be fired or thrown in order to make this attack possible. An ally who has this feat and _Broken Wing Gambit_ can instead use _Broken Wing Gambit_ to attempt an attack of opportunity against the foe, but cannot attempt both that attack of opportunity and this ranged attack.
