# Improved Spell Sharing (Teamwork)

Your link with your companion creature allows you to share your magic with it.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to acquire an animal companion, eidolon, familiar, or special _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_.

**Benefit:** When you are adjacent to or sharing a square with your companion creature and that companion creature has this feat, you can cast a spell on yourself and divide the duration evenly between yourself and the companion creature. You can use this feat only on spells with a duration of at least 2 rounds. For example, you could cast _[[spells/Bull's Strength|bull's strength]]_ on yourself, and instead of the spell lasting 1 minute per level on yourself, it lasts 5 rounds per level on yourself and 5 rounds per level on your companion. Once the spell is cast, you and the companion creature can move farther apart without ending the effect.
