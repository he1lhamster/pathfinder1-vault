# Death Roll (Combat)

Like an alligator, you twist and wrench your foe, forcing him to the ground.

**Prerequisites:** Bite attack, reptilian subtype.

**Benefit:** When grappling a foe of your size or smaller, you can attempt to perform a _[[feats/Death Roll|death roll]]_. Upon a successful grapple combat maneuver check to deal damage with your bite attack, you can immediately attempt a second grapple combat maneuver check as a free action. If successful, you _[[spells/Knock|knock]]_ the target _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_. Upon knocking the target _prone_, you must either release the grapple or fall _prone_ and maintain the grapple. This doesn't count as a combat maneuver check to maintain the grapple, and doesn't add any other effects (such as _[[universal monster rules/Constrict|constrict]]_) beyond knocking the target _prone_.
