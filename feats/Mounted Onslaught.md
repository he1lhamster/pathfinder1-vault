# Mounted Onslaught

You and your _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_ can _[[spells/Shatter|shatter]]_ an enemy's line with your unyielding assault.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Mounted Combat|Mounted Combat]]_, _[[universal monster rules/Trample|Trample]]_, Ride 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** On your turn, you can overrun more than one creature. Each overrun combat maneuver check beyond the first takes a cumulative -5 penalty. If you fail to overrun a target, your movement ends. Your _mount_ can make only a single hoof attack against one target that is knocked _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ by your overrun (not one per _prone_ opponent).

**Normal:** You can perform only one overrun combat maneuver per round.
