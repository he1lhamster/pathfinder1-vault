# Far-Roaming Familiar

Distance can't sever the bond between you and your familiar.

**Prerequisites:** Intelligence 13, must have a familiar.

**Benefit:** You retain your empathic link to your familiar regardless of distance, though lead blocks the link at distances greater than 1 mile (similar to the way lead blocks _[[spells/Detect Magic|detect magic]]_ effects).
