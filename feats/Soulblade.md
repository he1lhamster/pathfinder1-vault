# Soulblade (Combat)

You can't always count on having a source of positive energy to fight haunts, and have mastered an eerie talent for brief ly focusing your own life energy into your weapons.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (religion) 1 rank, Perception 1 rank.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can make a weapon attack against a haunt. If successful, your attack deals damage equal to your weapon dice plus any enhancement bonus (but not other bonuses, such as those granted by Strength, _[[feats/Weapon Specialization|Weapon Specialization]]_, or class features like sneak attack). You can use any _[[feats/Vital Strike|Vital Strike]]_ feat in order to enhance this attack. Whenever you come within 10 feet of a haunt's area, you can attempt to notice it as though casting _[[spells/Detect Undead|detect undead]]_ (with the standard -4 penalty).
