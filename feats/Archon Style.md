# Archon Style (Combat, Style)

You protect your allies from _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_, even at the cost of your own safety.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_; _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_; base attack bonus +2 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 1st.

**Benefit:** While using this style, as a move action, you can protect adjacent allies from a single opponent that you currently threaten. This grants adjacent allies a +2 _[[feats/Dodge|dodge]]_ bonus to AC against that opponent's next melee attack (as long as that attack comes before the beginning of your next turn), but causes you to take a -2 penalty to AC against that opponent until your next turn. The _dodge_ bonus against the designated opponent's attacks persists even if your allies move away from you.
