# Bloody Vengeance (Combat)

Your retaliatory strikes have long-lasting effects.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +1, worshiper of Calistria.

**Benefit:** If an opponent within line of sight has damaged you within the last minute, you may study that opponent as a standard action. Thereafter, if you hit that opponent with a melee attack, you deal 1 point of _[[universal monster rules/Bleed|bleed]]_ damage to that creature in addition to the normal damage dealt by your attack.
