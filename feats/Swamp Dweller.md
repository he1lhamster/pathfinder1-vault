# Swamp Dweller

You have trained with the Muckmouth _[[monsters/Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]]_ of the Hao Jin Tapestry and learned their ways.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, must have visited the Hao Jin Tapestry.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on Swim checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Swim, the bonus increases to +4. This bonus doubles while you're in marshy terrain. In addition, you can move normally into squares with a shallow bog, and it costs you only 2 squares of movement to move into a square with a deep bog (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 427).
