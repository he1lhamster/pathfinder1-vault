# Improved Disarm Partner (Combat, Teamwork)

You are ever the opportunist.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Disarm Partner|Disarm Partner]]_, base attack bonus +5.

**Benefit:** When an ally with this feat fails a disarm combat maneuver check made on his turn against a foe that's within your melee reach, you can make an attack of opportunity against that foe. If that attack of opportunity hits the foe, you can also attempt a disarm combat maneuver check against that opponent as part of that attack of opportunity.
