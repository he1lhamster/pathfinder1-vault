# Quick Trapper

Your trap-making proficiency improves greatly.

**Prerequisites:** Learn _[[classes/Ranger|Ranger]]_ TrapUM or trap class feature, Survival 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** When setting a _ranger_ trap (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 64), you can do so as a standard action rather than a full-round action. If you do so, the trap DC is reduced by 5.
