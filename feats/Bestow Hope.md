# Bestow Hope

You instill hope in the creatures you _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Channel|Improved Channel]]_, channel energy class feature, worshiper of Sarenrae.

**Benefit:** When you _heal_ a creature by _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Channeling|channeling]]_ positive energy, you also relieve its _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_. If a creature you _heal_ is _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_, that condition ends. If the creature is _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_, it becomes _shaken_ instead. If the creature is _[[conditions/Panicked|panicked]]_, it becomes _frightened_ instead.
