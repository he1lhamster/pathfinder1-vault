# Possess Object

A fiend gains the power to bind its malign essence to a single object, corrupting it into a relic of undeniable evil.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 18, any evil outsider with 9 or more Hit Dice.

**Benefit:** Once per day, as a full-round action, a fiend can possess a Large or smaller object. Unattended, a mundane object receives no saving throw against _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_, while an attended object uses its owner's saving throw to make a Will save equal to 10 + half the fiend's Hit Dice + the fiend's Charisma modifier. Magic items save as if they were subject to a spell. Items within the area of effect of a _[[spells/Hallow|hallow]]_ spell cannot be possessed. This effect is similar to that detailed in the _[[feats/Possess Creature|Possess Creature]]_ feat, except that objects do not receive a daily save to escape the fiend's influence and the fiend's _possession_ points can only be spent on object-possession actions. Should a possessed object be destroyed, the fiend is ejected, retakes its original form in an adjacent space, and is _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_ for 1 round. _[[spells/Dispel Evil|Dispel evil]]_ (or _[[spells/Dispel Chaos|dispel chaos]]_ or _[[spells/Dispel Law|dispel law]]_, depending on the fiend) can eject a fiend, but the caster must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the HD of the possessing fiend + the fiend's Cha modifier. _[[spells/Banishment|Banishment]]_ and _[[spells/Dismissal|dismissal]]_ immediately eject a fiend from an object if it fails to make its saving throw against the spell's effects.
