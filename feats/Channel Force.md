# Channel Force

Your channel is bolstered by your faith, allowing you to move and damage your foes.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Aasimar|Aasimar]]_, channel energy 2d6.

**Benefit:** When you channel energy to deal damage, you may choose to affect only a single target within 30 feet. In addition to dealing damage, if that single target fails its saving throw, you may _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ or push (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 303) the target up to 5 feet for every 2d6 points of channel energy damage you are capable of dealing.
