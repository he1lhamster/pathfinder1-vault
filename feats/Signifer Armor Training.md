# Signifer Armor Training

You have learned the art of spellcasting while wearing signifer armor.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Arcane Armor Mastery|Arcane Armor Mastery]]_, _[[feats/Arcane Armor Training|Arcane Armor Training]]_, _[[feats/Heavy Armor Proficiency|Heavy Armor Proficiency]]_, caster level 7th, must swear allegiance to a single _[[npcs/Hellknight|Hellknight]]_ order.

**Benefit:** As a swift action, you can reduce the arcane spell failure chance due to the armor you are wearing by 30% for any spells you cast this round. This benefit applies only if you are wearing armor with "_Hellknight_" in its name. This bonus replaces, and does not stack with, the bonuses granted by _Arcane Armor Mastery_, _Arcane Armor Training_, and similar feats and effects.
