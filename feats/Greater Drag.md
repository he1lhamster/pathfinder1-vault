# Greater Drag (Combat)

Foes that you drag are thrown out of balance.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Improved Drag|Improved Drag]]_, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to drag a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by _Improved Drag_. Whenever you drag a foe, his movement provokes attacks of opportunity from all of your allies (but not you).

**Normal:** Creatures moved by drag do not provoke attacks of opportunity.
