# Daring Exploit

Your _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Determination|determination]]_ allows you to accomplish great things, at a risk of great failure.

**Prerequisites:** Dare, deeds, or inspiration class ability.

**Benefit:** Once per day before using the derring-do deed, a dare, or a similar ability that allows you to roll a die and add the result to a d20 roll, you can roll the bonus die twice and take the higher result. If rolling a high result would allow you to roll the bonus dice additional times, you gain the benefits of this feat only on the first roll. You can use this feat one additional time per day for every 4 character levels you have.
