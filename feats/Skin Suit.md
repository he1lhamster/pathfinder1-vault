# Skin Suit (Monster)

During the _[[spells/Daylight|daylight]]_ hours, you can cloak your unnatural form beneath a _[[spells/Veil|veil]]_ of flesh and blood.

**Prerequisites:** Int 7, undead creature that was originally humanoid.

**Benefit:** Once per day as a full-round action, you can cloak your body in a thin, fleshy suit that gives you the appearance of yourself as a young adult humanoid. Your appearance changes as per _[[spells/Alter Self|alter self]]_, but this feat doesn't adjust your ability scores or grant any new abilities. When so disguised, you cannot use slashing or piercing _[[universal monster rules/Natural Attacks|natural attacks]]_, such as bite or claw attacks, without unraveling and destroying your _[[feats/Skin Suit|skin suit]]_, nor can you deliver _[[universal monster rules/Energy Drain|energy drain]]_ or ability damage with your undead special attacks (such as a _[[monsters/Wight|wight]]_ or _[[monsters/Vampire|vampire]]_'s slam attacks) without destroying the suit. While wearing a _skin suit_, your alignment is masked as though by a constant _[[spells/Undetectable Alignment|undetectable alignment]]_ spell, and you have the aura of a living creature instead of an undead creature for the purposes of _[[spells/Detect Undead|detect undead]]_ and similar effects. The _skin suit_ dissolves into a puddle of bloody slurry at sundown, though you can remove it at any time as a standard action. The _skin suit_ does not protect you from the effects of being exposed to direct sunlight. Finally, if you take lethal damage while wearing your _skin suit_, you must succeed at a Reflex save with a DC equal to the amount of lethal damage or the _skin suit_ is destroyed.
