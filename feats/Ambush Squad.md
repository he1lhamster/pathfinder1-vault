# Ambush Squad (Combat, Teamwork)

You know that the keys to victory are sudden attacks and even more sudden retreats.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +1, _[[monsters/Kobold|kobold]]_.

**Benefit:** When you're adjacent to an ally who also has this feat at the beginning of a surprise round, and both you and that ally can act during that surprise round, you can take both a standard action and a move action during that surprise round.

**Normal:** You can take only a standard action or a move action during a surprise round.
