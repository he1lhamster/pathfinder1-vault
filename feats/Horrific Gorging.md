# Horrific Gorging (Combat, Monster)

In the space of a few horrific seconds, you can chew up and gulp down an entire humanoid body.

**Prerequisites:** Bite attack, Large or larger, _[[universal monster rules/Swallow Whole|swallow whole]]_ universal monster ability.

**Benefit:** As a full-round action, you can completely consume a dead, _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_, _[[conditions/Paralyzed|paralyzed]]_, or otherwise _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ humanoid creature that you could normally swallow with your _swallow whole_ ability. When you do, you deal bite damage as a critical hit and swallow the humanoid as your _swallow whole_ special ability. Allies of the swallowed creature within 30 feet that can see you indulge in this horrific feast must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) to avoid being _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 1d4 rounds. This part of the ability is a mind-affecting _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effect.
