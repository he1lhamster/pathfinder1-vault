# Twin Fang Strike (Combat)

You strike at your enemies with both weapons simultaneously.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15; _[[feats/Quick Draw|Quick Draw]]_; _[[feats/Twin Fang Style|Twin Fang Style]]_*; _[[feats/Two-Weapon Fighting|Two-Weapon Fighting]]_; Acrobatics 6 ranks; base attack bonus +6 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 6th.

**Benefit:** While using _Twin Fang Style_, when you take an attack action while wielding two daggers or two _[[items/Weapon/Kama|kama]]_, you can strike with both your primary and off-hand weapons. If you do so, both attacks take a -4 penalty and you apply precision damage and effects that occur when you hit only once, even if you hit with both attacks.
