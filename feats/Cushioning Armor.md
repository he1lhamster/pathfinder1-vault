# Cushioning Armor (Armor Mastery)

You twist in your armor, allowing it to mitigate your fall.

**Prerequisites:** Armor _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ class feature, proficiency with _[[classes/Medium|medium]]_ or heavy armor.

**Benefit:** When you take falling damage, you can direct half of the damage to your armor. This damage ignores the armor's hardness.
