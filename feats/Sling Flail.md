# Sling Flail (Combat)

You can use your loaded _[[items/Weapon/Sling|sling]]_ to effectively strike at nearby foes.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_sling_), base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** You can make melee attacks using your loaded _sling_, using that weapon's normal statistics but treating it as a flail. Using a _sling_ in this way does not _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ mundane ammunition, but magical or masterwork ammunition loses its special properties after a single hit.

**Special:** Any feats you have that apply when you use a flail also apply when you use a loaded _sling_ as a melee weapon.
