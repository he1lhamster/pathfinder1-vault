# Venomous Spray (Combat)

You can spit your poison into a nearby opponent's face.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Serpentfolk|Serpentfolk]]_.

**Benefit:** You can _[[spells/Spit Venom|spit venom]]_ as a secondary ranged attack with a range of 5 feet. This is a natural attack and doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. A target struck by your venom must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = your poison DC) or be _[[conditions/Blinded|blinded]]_ for 1d4 rounds and suffer the normal effects of your poison. You can't use this attack during any round in which you make a bite attack (and vice versa). After spitting venom, you are unable to use your poisonous bite or to _spit venom_ for 1d4 rounds.
