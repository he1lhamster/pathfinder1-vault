# Deadhand Style (Combat, Style)

Your study of death allow you to exploit your foes' fears.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 15, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, Knowledge (religion) 4 ranks, ki pool class feature, nongood alignment.

**Benefit:** While using this style, if you have at least 1 point in your ki pool, you gain a +2 bonus on saves against _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effects, and the DC of Intimidate checks against you increases by 4. As a swift action, you can spend 1 point from your ki pool to empower your unarmed strikes. Creatures hit with your unarmed strikes must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier) or become _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier. This is a mind-affecting _fear_ effect.
