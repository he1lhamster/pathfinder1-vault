# Savior's Arrow

Calling on the power of Erastil, you can fire an arrow that heals instead of harms.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to cast cure spells, proficient with _[[items/Weapon/Longbow|longbow]]_, worshiper of Erastil.

**Benefit:** Once per day when you cast a cure spell, you can replace the normal somatic component with drawing a _longbow_ to create a shaft of green glowing light. When you fire the bow as a part of casting the spell and hit your target with a ranged touch attack, the green shaft of light cures the target as if it were touched by the cure spell.
