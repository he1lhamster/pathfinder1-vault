# Traumatic Spell-Like Ability (Monster)

Your spell-like ability causes affected targets to relive their torments in nightly terrors.

**Prerequisites:** Spell-like ability at caster level 6th or higher.

**Benefit:** Choose one of your _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a _[[feats/Traumatic Spell-Like Ability|traumatic spell-like ability]]_ three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). When you use a _traumatic spell-like ability_, affected targets must succeed at an additional Will saving throw the next time that they sleep (DC = the spell-like ability's DC) or be affected as per _[[spells/Nightmare|nightmare]]_. Each time the target fails its save, it must save again the following night or be affected by another _nightmare_, though the save DC decreases by 2 each night after the first. This feat can be applied only to _spell-like abilities_ with the emotion or _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ descriptor. Targets that avoid the spell-like ability's effects avoid this feat's effect as well. You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 2. For a summary, see Table 3-1.

**Special:** This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you are able to apply it to a different spell-like ability.
