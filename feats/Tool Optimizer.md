# Tool Optimizer

You can easily find items that function as tools or augment your own set of tools.

**Prerequisites:** Craft (any) 1 rank, Disable Device 1 rank, or Profession (any) 1 rank.

**Benefit:** You take no penalty for using an improvised tool associated with a skill in which you have at least 1 rank. For example, if you have 1 rank in Disable Device, you take no penalty when opening a lock without a proper tool. If you have at least 3 ranks in a skill, you can treat a normal tool associated with that skill as though it were a _[[items/Mundane/Masterwork tool|masterwork tool]]_.
