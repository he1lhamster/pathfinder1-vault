# Umbral Shift (Teamwork)

Your shadows dance in the _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_, carrying you with them swiftly and silently so that you're able to _[[feats/Swap Places|swap places]]_ with your kindred.

**Prerequisites:** _Darkness_ racial spell-like ability.

**Benefit:** Whenever you and an ally with the _darkness_ racial spell-like ability who also has this feat are each in an area of _darkness_ within 20 feet of an object radiating _darkness_ from a _darkness_ spell, you can _swap places_ with that ally as a swift action. Your ally must be willing and must spend an immediate action to complete the swap.
