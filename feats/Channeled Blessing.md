# Channeled Blessing

Your channeled energy can deliver a _[[classes/Warpriest|warpriest]]_'s blessing.

**Prerequisites:** Blessings class feature, channel energy class feature.

**Benefit:** When you channel energy to _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_, you can instead deliver a _warpriest_'s blessing to a single willing creature (including yourself ) in the area that otherwise would have been healed by your channeled energy. The blessing must be one that requires a standard action and affects one or more creatures. If the blessing would normally affect multiple targets, you affect only a single target. The target receives the blessing in place of the healing and any other effects of the channeled energy. (This application doesn't count toward your uses of blessings per day.)
