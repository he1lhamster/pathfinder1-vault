# Black Marketeer

You have many contacts and a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Keen|keen]]_ eye for hidden opportunities in the marketplace.

**Prerequisites:** Appraise 4 ranks, Gather Information 4 ranks, Knowledge (local) 4 ranks.

**Benefit:** By utilizing your black market connections, you acquire a resource pool worth 100 gp. This functions like the resource pool gained by the Profits of Kalistrade feat (see Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting page 73) except it can only be used on illegal or illicit items or services (note that something may be illegal or illicit in one area but perfectly acceptable in another) and is centered on Osirion rather than Druma. Typical illegal or illicit items are drugs, poisons, evil magic items, slaves, or dead bodies, though intangibles such as secret information may also qualify (and for these items, a secret of equal value-at the GM's discretion-must be contributed to the pool).
