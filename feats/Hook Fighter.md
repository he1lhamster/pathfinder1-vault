# Hook Fighter (Combat)

In your _[[feats/Deft Hands|deft hands]]_, a climbing tool becomes a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ weapon.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** You treat a _[[items/Weapon/Grappling hook|grappling hook]]_ as a one-handed weapon that deals piercing damage equal to a _[[items/Weapon/Heavy pick|heavy pick]]_ of its size and that has the disarm and _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ special weapon features. You do not incur penalties as you would for using a _grappling hook_ as an improvised weapon. If you are proficient with whips and your _grappling hook_ has at least 10 feet of rope or chain attached to it, you can treat it as a two-handed melee weapon with 15-foot reach, though you can use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including adjacent foes), though you don't threaten any squares with it. Changing between using a _grappling hook_ as a normal weapon and a reach weapon is a move action. When performing a repositionAPG maneuver with a _grappling hook_, you can only move the target toward you from its original position.
