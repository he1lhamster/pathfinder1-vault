# Possessed Hand

You've made a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Peaceful|peaceful]]_ and permanent bargain with a _[[monsters/Ghost|ghost]]_, spirit, or outsider. It possesses your hand, guiding and aiding you in exchange for help in return.

**Benefit:** You attract a _ghost_, spirit, or outsider with personal motivations to possess your hand. This usually involves some sort of mutually beneficial pact or agreement. Your _[[feats/Possessed Hand|possessed hand]]_ helps you in numerous ways, but its periodic, uncontrolled antics are _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Distracting|distracting]]_; you take a permanent -2 penalty on concentration checks once you gain this feat. Any attack you make with a one-handed weapon, light weapon, unarmed strike, or natural attack with your _possessed hand_ gains a +1 insight bonus on the attack roll and damage roll. You also gain a +1 insight bonus on Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks. Once per day as a swift action, you can retrieve any stowed object you carry on your person, provided the object weighs no more than 5 pounds.
