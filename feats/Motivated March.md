# Motivated March

Years of forcing your slaves and soldiers to march far beyond the limits of their _[[feats/Endurance|endurance]]_ have made you an excellent _[[feats/Taskmaster|taskmaster]]_.

**Benefit:** When traveling overland, you and a number of allies equal to 10 times your character level reduce the amount of nonlethal damage taken as a result of a forced march by half. Creatures benefiting from this feat can delay the _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_ effect of a forced march for a number of hours equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). A creature that delays this effect becomes _[[conditions/Exhausted|exhausted]]_ instead of _fatigued_ when the condition takes effect.
