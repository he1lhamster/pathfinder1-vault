# Possess Location

A fiend learns to disperse its essence over an area, gaining mastery over features and structures there and tainting the place with its wickedness.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 16, any evil outsider with 8 or more Hit Dice.

**Benefit:** Once per day, as a full-round action, a fiend may attempt to possess a structure or small area (like a pool, grove, or ruin) of a diameter equal to 10 feet per Hit Die. This area is spherical, so a fiend possessing a particularly large structure might only have power over a certain number of rooms. An area receives no save against fiendish _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_ unless creatures or magical items occupy the space, in which case the area makes a Will save equal to 10 + half the fiend's Hit Dice + the fiend's Charisma modifier using the stats of the occupant with the highest Will save. An area within the effects of a _[[spells/Hallow|hallow]]_ spell cannot be possessed. A fiend possessing an area operates similarly to one using the _[[feats/Possess Creature|Possess Creature]]_ feat, except that locations do not receive daily saves to escape the fiend's influence and the fiend's _possession_ points can only be spent on location _possession_ actions. Should a possessed location be destroyed, the fiend is ejected, retakes its original form in a space adjacent to the area it previously possessed, and is _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_ for 1 round. _[[spells/Dispel Evil|Dispel evil]]_ (or _[[spells/Dispel Chaos|dispel chaos]]_ or _[[spells/Dispel Law|dispel law]]_, depending on the fiend) can eject a fiend, but the caster must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the HD of the possessing fiend + the fiend's Cha modifier. _[[spells/Banishment|Banishment]]_ and _[[spells/Dismissal|dismissal]]_ immediately eject a fiend from an object if it fails to make its saving throw against the spell's effects.
