# Puppet Master (Story)

You crave power you can wield without drawing attention to yourself.

**Prerequisites:** You must have survived an encounter with a challenging foe without suffering significant _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ by striking a deal (regardless of whether the deal was with the challenging foe or not), or have the BossUCA, the Liege LordUCA, or the Well-Connected FriendUCA background.

**Benefit:** If you succeed at a Diplomacy check to make a request of a creature by 5 or more, the DCs of additional requests you attempt increase by 1 per request, rather than 5.

**Goal:** Either thwart or decisively defeat an appropriate number of challenging foes as a direct result of bargains you have struck or control at least three leaders of settlements of at least 2,000 residents or similarly influential administrators for at least 6 months without being publicly exposed.

**Completion Benefit:** If you succeed at a Diplomacy check to make a request of a creature, the DCs of additional requests you attempt increase by 1 per request, rather than 5.
