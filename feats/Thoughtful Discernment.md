# Thoughtful Discernment

Thinking back, you discover a lie in what you once thought to be words of truth.

**Prerequisites:** _[[spells/Discern Lies|Discern lies]]_ class feature.

**Benefit:** Once per day as a free action, you can think back about a single statement you heard in the last day and determine if it was a lie. This acts like the _discern lies_ spell, but instead of affecting a creature, it affects a single statement a creature has made. For example, if the _[[npcs/King|king]]_ told you, "My daughter is in the monster's dungeon" before you left to find her, as long as the _king_ said that to you within the past day, you can use this feat to determine whether or not the _king_ deliberately and knowingly lied to you when he made that statement.
