# Inner Breath

Your body is suffused with elemental air that provides for all your respiratory needs.

**Prerequisites:** Character level 11th, _[[monsters/Sylph|sylph]]_.

**Benefit:** You no longer need to breathe. You are immune to effects that require breathing (such as inhaled poison). This does not give you _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to cloud or gas attacks that do not require breathing, such as _[[spells/Cloudkill|cloudkill]]_.
