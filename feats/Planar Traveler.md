# Planar Traveler (Story)

The confines of the Material Plane cannot sate your wanderlust, and you walk between alternate spheres of reality unhindered.

**Prerequisites:** You must be related to an outsider or have been born on a plane other than the Material Plane.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on Survival checks when outside your home plane. You can _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ portals and other _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Planar|planar]]_ connections as well as where they lead by sight or touch with a successful DC 20 Perception check.

**Goal:** Spend at least 24 consecutive hours on three different planes of existence other than your home plane or more than a month on a single plane other than your home plane. Demiplanes do not count for the purposes of fulfilling this goal.

**Completion Benefit:** Whenever you cast a spell or use a magic item to travel to another plane, you always arrive exactly where you had intended. In addition, when identifying portals with the first benefit of this feat, you gain a glimpse of what you would see, hear, and smell upon arriving on the other end of the portal.

**Suggested Traits:** Fey Protection, _[[feats/Scholar|Scholar]]_ of the Great BeyondAPG, Wanderlust.
