# Improved Lookout

You and your allies alert each other to surprise attacks.

**Prerequisites:** LookoutAPG.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has the _[[feats/Lookout|Lookout]]_ teamwork feat, when either of you first takes an action, you both lose the _[[conditions/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]_ condition.
