# Flexible Shadow Jump

You have refined your ability to leap through the shadows.

**Prerequisites:** _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|Shadow]]_ _[[spells/Jump|jump]]_ shadowdancer class feature.

**Benefit:** When you travel between shadows using the _shadow_ _jump_ ability, the minimum increment that you can _jump_ is 5 feet, allowing you to _[[universal monster rules/Split|split]]_ your _shadow_ jumps into 5-foot increments instead of 10-foot increments. In addition, your _shadow_ _jump_ ability counts as the ability to cast _[[spells/Dimension Door|dimension door]]_ for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of the Dimensional AgilityUC feat as well as any feat that lists that feat as a prerequisite, and your _shadow_ _jump_ benefits from such feats as if you were casting _dimension door_.

**Normal:** Each _shadow_ _jump_, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment.
