# Shield Snag (Combat)

You know how to navigate your _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ around weapons and can use it to keep your balance.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved _Shield_ Bash|Improved _Shield_ Bash]]_, _[[feats/Shield Proficiency|Shield Proficiency]]_, _[[feats/Two-Weapon Fighting|Two-Weapon Fighting]]_, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** Any opponents hit by your _shield_ bash are also targeted by a free disarm attempt, substituting your attack roll for the combat maneuver check. This disarm attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You cannot use this ability during the same round as a bull rush attempt made with _[[feats/Shield Slam|Shield Slam]]_ or with any other abilities that affect how your _shield_ bash works. When using a _shield_, you gain a +4 bonus on Strength checks to avoid being blown away by a strong wind and on Climb checks to catch yourself on a wall or slope when falling.
