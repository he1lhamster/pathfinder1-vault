# Mesmerizing Feint (Combat)

You're adept at feinting against even the least imaginative of creatures.

**Prerequisites:** Hypnotic stare class feature.

**Benefit:** You take only a -2 penalty when feinting against a non-humanoid and a -4 penalty when feinting against creatures with animal intelligence, as long as the target is a subject of your hypnotic stare. If you have at least 10 ranks in Bluff, you instead take no penalty when feinting against non-humanoids and creatures of animal intelligence under your hypnotic stare.

**Normal:** When feinting against a non-humanoid, you take a -4 penalty. Against a creature of animal intelligence, you take a -8 penalty.
