# Fabulist (Grit)

You enjoy telling tall tales and gain confidence when others believe them.

**Prerequisites:** Amateur GunslingerUC feat or grit class feature.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on Perform (act, comedy, oratory, and sing) skill checks, and Perform is a class skill for you. In addition, each time you make a successful Bluff check to convince someone of a far-fetched or impossible story, you regain 1 grit point. Successfully lying to a friendly or helpful creature, or a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half your character level, doesn't restore grit.
