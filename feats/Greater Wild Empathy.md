# Greater Wild Empathy

Your natural _[[feats/Empathy|empathy]]_ stretches across the world of nature.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (nature) 5 ranks, wild _empathy_ class feature.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 insight bonus on wild _empathy_ checks, and you may use wild _empathy_ to duplicate an Intimidate check rather than a Diplomacy check. In addition, choose one of the following kinds of creatures: elementals, fey, lycanthropes, plants, or vermin. You may inf luence creatures of that type with wild _empathy_, if their Intelligence score is 1 or 2, or they do not possess an Intelligence score. Once you choose the type of creature, it cannot be changed.

**Special:** You may select this feat more than once. Each time, you may choose an additional creature type to inf luence.
