# Patient Strike (Combat)

Your _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ under the Master of Swords has taught you that a well-timed strike is worth waiting for and that patience will serve you well in the long run.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13.

**Benefit:** You can choose to ready an attack as a fullround action instead of a standard action. When you do so, you gain a +2 bonus on your attack roll when your readied action triggers.

**Normal:** Readying an attack is a standard action and doesn't grant a bonus on your attack roll.
