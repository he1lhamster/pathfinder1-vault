# Sincere Flattery

Wyvarans have little skill in creating original art, but they have proven to be experts in imitating and even improving on it.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Wyvaran|Wyvaran]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on Craft checks to recreate an object you have seen before. You can spend 1 week studying the object to increase the circumstance bonus to +8. This doesn't include the time spent crafting the item.
