# Vim And Vigor (Combat)

You rebound more quickly than normal when you draw upon your inner reserve to repair your wounds.

**Prerequisites:** Con 13, _[[feats/Combat Vigor|Combat Vigor]]_*, _[[feats/Endurance|Endurance]]_, character level 3rd.

**Benefit:** Your _[[spells/Vigor|vigor]]_ pool gains 1 _vigor_ point. The _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_ condition that you gain from spending _vigor_ points (as described by the _Combat Vigor_ feat on page 14) lasts for 3 rounds instead of 1 minute. In addition, when you take this feat, you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against effects that cause fatigue or exhaustion.
