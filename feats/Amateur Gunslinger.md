# Amateur Gunslinger (Combat)

Although you are not a _[[classes/Gunslinger|gunslinger]]_, you have and can use grit.

**Prerequisites:** You have no levels in a class that has the grit class feature.

**Benefit:** You gain a small amount of grit and the ability to perform a single 1st-level deed from the _gunslinger_ deed class feature. At the start of the day, you gain 1 grit point, though throughout the day you can gain grit points up to a maximum of your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). You can regain grit using the rules for the _gunslinger_'s grit class feature (see page 9). You can spend this grit to perform the 1st-level deed you chose upon taking this feat, and any other deed you have gained through feats or magic items.

**Special:** If you gain levels in a class that grants the grit class feature, you can immediately trade this feat for the _[[feats/Extra Grit|Extra Grit]]_ feat.
