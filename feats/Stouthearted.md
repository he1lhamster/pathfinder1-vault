# Stouthearted

You fight back your _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ by voicing the song in your heart.

**Prerequisites:** Raging song class feature.

**Benefit:** While you are maintaining a raging song, if you fail a saving throw against a _fear_ effect, you can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ a round of performing to reroll your saving throw as an immediate action. You must keep this second result, even if it lower.
