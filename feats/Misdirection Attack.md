# Misdirection Attack (Combat)

After misdirecting your opponent's weapon attack, you leave your opponent open to further violence.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Deceitful|Deceitful]]_, _[[feats/Misdirection Redirection|Misdirection Redirection]]_, _[[feats/Misdirection Tactics|Misdirection Tactics]]_, Bluff 10 ranks.

**Benefit:** When you successfully use the _Misdirection Tactics_ feat to negate a melee weapon attack, the opponent whose attack you negated provokes an attack of opportunity from you, even though you normally can't take attacks of opportunity while using the total defense action. This effect is in addition to the effect gained from _Misdirection Redirection_.
