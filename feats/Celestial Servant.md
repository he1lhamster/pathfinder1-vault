# Celestial Servant

Rather than being a normal animal or beast, your companion or familiar hails from the heavenly realms.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Aasimar|Aasimar]]_, animal companion, familiar, or _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_ class feature.

**Benefit:** Your animal companion, familiar, or _mount_ gains the celestial template and becomes a magical beast, though you may still treat it as an animal when using Handle Animal, wild _[[feats/Empathy|empathy]]_, or any other spells or class abilities that specifically affect animals.
