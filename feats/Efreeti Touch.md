# Efreeti Touch (Combat)

Your knowledge of the secrets of the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Burning|burning]]_ wind and blazing sun allows you to collect flames into your hands and unleash them in a gout of elemental fire.

**Prerequisites:** Con 15, Wis 17, _[[feats/Efreeti Style|Efreeti Style]]_, _[[feats/Efreeti Stance|Efreeti Stance]]_, _[[feats/Elemental Fist|Elemental Fist]]_**, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +13 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 11th.

**Benefit:** While using _Efreeti Style_, as a standard action, you can spend two _Elemental Fist_ (Advanced Player's Guide 158) attempts to unleash a 15-foot coneshaped burst of flame. Creatures caught in the cone take your unarmed strike damage plus the fire damage from your _Elemental Fist_ and catch on fire. A successful Ref lex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modif ier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from catching on fire.
