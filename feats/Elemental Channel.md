# Elemental Channel

Choose one elemental subtype, such as air, earth, fire, or water. You can channel your divine energy to _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ or _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ outsiders that possess your chosen elemental subtype.

**Prerequisites:** Channel energy class feature.

**Benefit:** Instead of its normal effect, you can choose to have your ability to channel energy _heal_ or _harm_ outsiders of your chosen elemental subtype. You must make this choice each time you channel energy. If you choose to _heal_ or _harm_ creatures of your elemental subtype, your channel energy has no affect on other creatures. The amount of damage healed or dealt and the DC to halve the damage is otherwise unchanged.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take this feat, it applies to a new elemental subtype.
