# Cosmic Gate

You know that the stars shining in Cynosure's pools aren't reflections, but are gateways, and you can use this knowledge in your travels.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Lady Luck's Guidance|Lady Luck's Guidance]]_*, Knowledge (planes) 10 ranks.

**Benefit:** Once per day, you can briefly enter Cynosure and use the pools located there to instantly travel to a nearby location on the Material Plane; this functions as teleport except you are always considered very familiar with your destination.
