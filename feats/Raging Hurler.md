# Raging Hurler

An opponent can do little to evade your wrathful pitching of weapons and objects.

**Prerequisites:** _[[spells/Rage|Rage]]_ class feature, _[[feats/Throw Anything|Throw Anything]]_.

**Benefit:** While raging, you can throw a two-handed weapon as a standard action, and you double the range increment for weapons you throw. If you also have the _[[feats/Quick Draw|Quick Draw]]_ feat, you can throw two-handed weapons at your full normal rate of attacks. Further, you can pick up an unattended object that you can use as a improvised weapon within your reach as part of the attack action to throw that item.
