# Hinder (Blood Hex)

You curse a bleeding opponent with _[[feats/Uncertainty|uncertainty]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, Use Magic Device 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can curse an enemy you've damaged with a melee attack in the last minute to become hesitant. The target must succeed at a Reflex save or take a -10 penalty on any initiative check it makes in the next minute.

**Special:** If a _[[classes/Shaman|shaman]]_ or _[[classes/Witch|witch]]_ uses this blood hex, the target is unable to take a full-attack action for 1 round. This effect can be extended with the cackle hex.
