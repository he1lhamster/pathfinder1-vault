# Word of Healing

Using the same divine energy as your lay on hands ability, you can _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ others at a distance.

**Prerequisites:** Lay on hands class feature.

**Benefit:** You may use your lay on hands to _heal_ another creature at a range of 30 feet as a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You must be able to speak and have a free hand to use this ability. The target heals half the amount they would have healed if you had touched them, but gains the benef its of your mercies as normal.
