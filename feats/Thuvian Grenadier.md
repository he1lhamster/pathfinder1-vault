# Thuvian Grenadier (Teamwork)

_[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|Training]]_ with alchemically inclined allies helps you avoid _[[feats/Friendly Fire|friendly fire]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Precise Shot|Precise Shot]]_ or _[[feats/Throw Anything|Throw Anything]]_.

**Benefit:** Whenever you hit a creature with a splash weapon, you may choose to exclude one creature within the weapon's splash area from taking splash damage. If a creature within the splash area also has this feat, it automatically ignores splash damage from your splash weapons on a successful hit. In addition, if you miss with a splash weapon and the errant weapon lands in a square occupied or adjacent to an ally with this feat, your ally can attempt a DC 20 Ref lex save. If the ally succeeds, he is able to catch the weapon. If your ally also has the _[[feats/Snatch Arrows|Snatch Arrows]]_ feat, he can toss the splash weapon back to you as an immediate action.
