# Jaguar Pounce (Combat)

Your ambushes are especially lethal.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit:** When making a charge or using _[[feats/Spring Attack|Spring Attack]]_ against an opponent who is _[[conditions/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]_ or _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_, you treat your first melee attack against that target as if you had the _[[feats/Improved Critical|Improved Critical]]_ feat.
