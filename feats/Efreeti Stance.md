# Efreeti Stance (Combat)

Calling upon the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Burning|burning]]_ spirits of incarnate flame, you can manipulate fire to protect yourself and immolate your foes.

**Prerequisites:** Con 15, Wis 15, _[[feats/Efreeti Style|Efreeti Style]]_, _[[feats/Elemental Fist|Elemental Fist]]_**, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +11 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 9th.

**Benefit:** You gain one additional _Elemental Fist_ (Advanced Player's Guide 158) attempt per day. While using _Efreeti Style_, you gain fire _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ equal to your base attack bonus or your _monk_ level plus any base attack bonus gained from levels in classes other than _monk_, whichever is higher. While denied your Dexterity bonus to AC you are also denied this _resistance_. Creatures that take fire damage from your _Elemental Fist_ attack must succeed at a Ref lex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) or catch on fire.
