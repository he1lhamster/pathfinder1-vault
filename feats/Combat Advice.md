# Combat Advice

Your succinct words can aid an ally even in the _[[universal monster rules/Heat|heat]]_ of battle.

**Benefit:** As a move action, you can offer useful advice to an ally engaged in combat at just the right moment. Designate an enemy; your ally gains a +2 competence bonus on her next attack roll against that enemy. For your ally to benefit from this feat, you must be able to clearly see your ally and the designated enemy, and your ally must be able to hear you.
