# Rapid Focus Shift

You can move _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Mental Focus|mental focus]]_ from one implement to another more quickly than usual.

**Prerequisites:** Caster level 5th, _mental focus_ class ability.

**Benefit:** Once per day, you can take a full-round action to shift _mental focus_ from one implement to another. You must be undisturbed and able to concentrate. If you take any damage during the transfer, you must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 10 + the number of points of damage taken) to complete the transfer. If you fail this check, you lose the points of _mental focus_ instead of moving them from one implement to the other.

**Normal:** Shifting focus between two implements takes 1 minute of quiet contemplation.

**Special:** You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you gain an additional daily use of _[[feats/Rapid Focus Shift|Rapid Focus Shift]]_.
