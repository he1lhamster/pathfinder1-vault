# Lifebound

You are especially responsive to curative magic that soothes your wounds with particular effectiveness.

**Benefit:** Whenever a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability heals you up to your maximum number of hit points, any excess hit points persist for 1 round per level as temporary hit points (up to a maximum number of hit points equal to 1/2 your character level). If the healing from the spell or spell-like ability would normally persist as temporary hit points (such as if the spell's caster were an _[[classes/Oracle|oracle]]_ of life with the spirit boost _[[spells/Revelation|revelation]]_), you instead add 1/2 your character level to the spell's caster's level to determine the total number of temporary hit points that you gain. For instance, if a 4th-level _oracle_ of life with the spirit boost _revelation_ heals a 4th-level _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_ with this feat, up to 6 points of healing could become temporary hit points for the _fighter_ (the _oracle_'s caster level + 1/2 the _fighter_'s level).
