# Old Cults Awakener

You hear the voices of the Old Ones, and believe it is your destiny to _[[spells/Awaken|awaken]]_ others to their ancient cause using bizarre and torturous rituals. Whether your work leaves these individuals mad or truly touched by alien sentience remains unproven.

**Prerequisites:** Old Cults 20 TPA.

**Benefit:** You can attempt a DC 25 _[[spells/Heal|Heal]]_ check upon an _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_ but _[[conditions/Stable|stable]]_ intelligent creature. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete. If it's successful, the victim must make a DC 25 Will save or he gains a false memory of a _[[spells/Vision|vision]]_ that he has personally been chosen by the Great Old Ones to serve them (treat as an implanted memory from _[[spells/Modify Memory|modify memory]]_, except this is a nonmagical effect). If the ritual is unsuccessful, the victim takes 1d2 points of Intelligence and Wisdom drain; you may attempt the ritual again.
