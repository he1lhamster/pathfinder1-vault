# Sisterhood Rampart (Combat)

The _[[feats/Shield Wall|shield wall]]_ was the heart of the _[[monsters/Gray|Gray]]_ Maidens' military strategy; combined with their precise tactical coordination, _[[npcs/Gray Maiden|Gray Maiden]]_ lines were nearly _[[feats/Unbreakable|unbreakable]]_. Maidens behind the line would then strike with polearms or longbows, picking off targets with ease.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, _[[feats/Shield Focus|Shield Focus]]_, _[[spells/Shield|Shield]]_ WallAPG, _[[feats/Sisterhood Style|Sisterhood Style]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_[[items/Weapon/Longsword|longsword]]_), base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit:** While using _Sisterhood Style_, you and adjacent allies gain an additional +1 bonus to the _shield_ bonus granted by _Shield Wall_, and each of you adds your _shield_ bonus to AC (not counting enhancement bonuses) to your CMD against bull rush combat maneuvers. In addition, you and adjacent allies do not provide soft cover against allies' attacks.
