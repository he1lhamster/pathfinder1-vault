# Stunning Fist (Combat)

You know just where to strike to temporarily stun a foe.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, Wis 13, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit:** You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). _[[feats/Stunning Fist|Stunning Fist]]_ forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A defender who fails this saving throw is _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_ for 1 round (until just before your next turn). A _stunned_ character drops everything held, can't take actions, loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, and takes a -2 penalty to AC. You may attempt a stunning attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be _stunned_.

**Special:** A _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ receives _Stunning Fist_ as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A _monk_ may attempt a stunning attack a number of times per day equal to his _monk_ level, plus one more time per day for every four levels he has in classes other than _monk_.
