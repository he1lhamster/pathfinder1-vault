# Twin Thunders Master (Combat)

With thunderous simultaneous strikes, you can batter a mighty giant into submission.

**Prerequisites:** Dwarf or gnome; defensive _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ racial trait; _[[feats/Improved Two-Weapon Fighting|Improved Two-Weapon Fighting]]_ and _[[feats/Two-Weapon Fighting|Two-Weapon Fighting]]_, or flurry of blows class feature; _[[feats/Twin Thunders|Twin Thunders]]_; _[[feats/Twin Thunders Flurry|Twin Thunders Flurry]]_; _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ with both wielded weapons; base attack bonus +9.

**Benefit:** Whenever you deal an opponent extra damage with the _Twin Thunders_ feat, that opponent is _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 1 round. You also force that opponent to succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + half your level + your Str modif ier) or become _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1 round. If you use this feat to render _staggered_ an opponent that is already _staggered_, you _[[spells/Daze|daze]]_ that opponent instead. In a similar way, you can stun an opponent that is already _[[conditions/Dazed|dazed]]_.
