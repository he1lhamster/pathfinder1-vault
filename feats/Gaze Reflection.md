# Gaze Reflection

The power of your _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ stare wards you from the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ gazes of your enemies.

**Prerequisites:** Spellcraft 10 ranks, bold stareOA and _[[classes/Mesmerist|mesmerist]]_ tricksOA class features.

**Benefit:** When you avert your eyes from a creature with a _[[universal monster rules/Gaze|gaze]]_ attack (including one produced by a spell like _[[spells/Eyebite|eyebite]]_ or _[[spells/Burning Gaze|burning gaze]]_ or by a magic item), you can roll twice and select the better result when checking to see whether you are exposed to that _gaze_ attack and when rolling your miss chance on attacks made against that creature (the latter doesn't stack with _[[feats/Blind-Fight|Blind-Fight]]_). In addition, as a swift action, you can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ one _mesmerist_ trick to make yourself immune to that creature's _gaze_ until the beginning of your next turn. If you _expend_ two _mesmerist_ tricks instead, you gain _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to that creature's _gaze_ and also reflect its _gaze_ back at it, affecting it with its own _gaze_.

**Special:** A _mesmerist_'s hypnotic stare, a _[[classes/Witch|witch]]_'s or hag's evil eye, and a _[[monsters/Vampire|vampire]]_'s dominate ability are treated as _gaze_ attacks for the purpose of this feat, as are abilities that are triggered when looking at a creature, such as a _[[monsters/Nymph|nymph]]_'s _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Blinding|blinding]]_ beauty or a sea hag's horrific appearance. Spending two _mesmerist_ tricks on this feat does not bypass any _immunity_ the creature might have to its own _gaze_, such as a _vampire_'s _immunity_ to mind-affecting effects or the fact that the _nymph_'s _blinding_ beauty works only on humanoids.
