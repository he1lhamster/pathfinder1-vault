# Scorching Weapons (Combat)

Elemental fire stirs within your body, boiling your blood and rendering you resistant to flame.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Ifrit|Ifrit]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against fire attacks and spells with the fire descriptor or light descriptor. As a swift action, you can make up to two held manufactured metallic weapons become red-hot for 1 round, dealing 1 additional point of fire damage with a successful hit. This does not stack with other effects that add fire damage to weapons, such as the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Flaming|flaming]]_ weapon special ability.
