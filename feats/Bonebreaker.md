# Bonebreaker (Combat)

When your opponent is unable to adequately defend against them, your precise unarmed strikes break bone and tear tissue.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Jawbreaker|Jawbreaker]]_, _[[feats/Stunning Fist|Stunning Fist]]_, _[[spells/Heal|Heal]]_ 9 ranks.

**Benefit:** When you make a successful _Stunning Fist_ attempt against an opponent that is _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_, _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_, or _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_, you can forgo any other _Stunning Fist_ effect to deal 1d6 Strength or Dexterity damage to that opponent.
