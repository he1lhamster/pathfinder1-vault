# Fan-Bearer At The King's Right Hand

Your creator was an aide and _[[feats/Bodyguard|bodyguard]]_, and your memories are filled with the sight of that charge.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Shabti|Shabti]]_.

**Benefit:** As a swift action, you can designate an adjacent ally as your charge. So long as you remain adjacent to that character, he benefits from your _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ to level drain and _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to undeath racial traits. This ability applies even if one of you is killed, so long as you remain adjacent.
