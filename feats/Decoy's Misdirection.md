# Decoy's Misdirection (Familiar)

You can fool _[[spells/Scrying|scrying]]_ attempts by using your familiar.

**Prerequisites:** Must have a familiar with the decoy archetype (see page 10).

**Benefit:** As long as your familiar is within 30 feet of you, anytime you succeed at a Will save to negate a _scrying_ effect (including _scrying_ and greater _scrying_), you become aware of the _scrying_ attempt as though you succeeded at the Spellcraft check to _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ it, and you can choose to let the spell function as normal instead of causing it to fail. If you do, you can choose to redirect the _scrying_ effect toward your familiar, causing the familiar to immediately _[[universal monster rules/Change Shape|change shape]]_ (as its secret sharer spell-like ability, except the duration is as long as the _scrying_ effect lasts). The creator of the _scrying_ effect observes the familiar as though it were you, though spells such as _[[spells/Detect Magic|detect magic]]_ detect the _[[spells/Alter Self|alter self]]_ effect as normal.
