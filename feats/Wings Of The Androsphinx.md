# Wings Of The Androsphinx (Combat)

You can reshape the kinetic energy of foes' charges.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Improved Reposition|Improved Reposition]]_, base attack bonus +1 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 1st.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus to AC against charge attacks. If a creature charges you and fails its attack roll, as an immediate action you can attempt a reposition combat maneuver (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 322) to reposition that foe. If you use a readied action to attack a creature charging you, you can roll to attack and then attempt to reposition that creature as a free action before it resolves its charge attack.
