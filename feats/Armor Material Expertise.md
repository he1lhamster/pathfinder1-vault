# Armor Material Expertise (Armor Mastery)

You tap into the potential of your armor's special material.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +6 or _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_ level 4th, armor _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ class feature.

**Benefit:** When wearing armor made of one of the materials listed below, you can use the listed ability twice per day (unless otherwise stated). Adamantine: As an immediate action after being struck by an attack, you convert half the lethal damage of the attack into nonlethal damage. AngelskinUE: As a swift action, you shine with bright light as _[[spells/Daylight|daylight]]_ for 1 round. Darkleaf ClothUE: As a swift action, you gain the woodland stride _[[classes/Druid|druid]]_ class feature for 1 minute. Dragonhide: As an immediate action when you take energy damage of the same type to which the dragonhide armor is immune, you reduce the damage taken by 10 hit points. Elysian BronzeUE: As an immediate action after being struck by an attack from a magical beast or monstrous humanoid, you convert half the lethal damage of the attack into nonlethal damage. Fire-Forged SteelUE or Frost-Forged SteelUE: As a swift action, any unarmed strikes, _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ bashes, or attacks with a _[[items/Weapon/Spiked gauntlet|spiked gauntlet]]_ or armor spikes you make are treated as having the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Flaming|flaming]]_ special ability (for fire-forged steel) or the frost special ability (for frost-forged steel) for 1 minute. Horacalcum (Pathfinder Adventure Path #61: Shards of Sin): Once per day as a swift action, you can grant yourself the benefits of _[[spells/Haste|haste]]_ for 1 round. Living SteelUE: As an immediate action after being struck by an attack with a metal weapon, you can use the living steel's ability to damage metal weapons, as if the attacker had rolled a natural 1 on the attack. Mithral: As an immediate action, you gain _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ against transmutation spells equal to 5 + the armor's enhancement bonus + your character level for 1 round. Noqual (Pathfinder Adventure Path #61: Shards of Sin): The armor's _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ bonus on saves increases to +4 for 1 round.
