# Bloatmage Initiate

Your introduction to the ways of the bloatmage allows you to use elaborate rituals and gruesome rites to increase the amount of blood and lymph in your body, expanding your reserves of magical energy.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Spell Focus|Spell Focus]]_ (any school).

**Benefit:** You learn the basics of the ancient art of hemotheurgy. Pick one school of magic in which you possess the _Spell Focus_ feat-you cast spells from this school of magic at +1 caster level. This bonus stacks with the bonus from _Spell Focus_. Unfortunately, the bloating side effects increase your girth to such a point that you are constantly under the effects of a _[[classes/Medium|medium]]_ load-your maximum bonus to AC from Dexterity is +3, you gain an armor check penalty of -3, and your speed decreases as appropriate (generally from 30 feet to 20 feet for a _Medium_ creature).
