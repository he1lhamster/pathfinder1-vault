# Greater Steal (Combat)

You have a knack for snatching items from your opponents in combat.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Improved Steal|Improved Steal]]_, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to steal an item from a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by _Improved Steal_. If you successfully steal an item from a foe during combat, it does not notice the theft until after combat is over or if it attempts to use the missing item.

**Normal:** Creatures automatically notice items taken from them through the steal combat maneuver.
