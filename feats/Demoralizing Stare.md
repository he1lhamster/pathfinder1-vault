# Demoralizing Stare (Combat, Stare)

Your painful stare inspires _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ in your foes.

**Prerequisites:** _[[classes/Mesmerist|Mesmerist]]_ level 9th, painful stare class feature.

**Benefit:** When you trigger your painful stare, the target must succeed at a Will Save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your _mesmerist_ level + your Charisma modifier) or become _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 1 round. This can't cause the target to become _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_, even if the target is already _shaken_.
