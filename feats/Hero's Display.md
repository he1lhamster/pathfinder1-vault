# Hero's Display (Combat, Performance)

With a dramatic flourish you display your weapons to the crowd. Onlookers are elated, and your enemies are demoralized.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Dazzling Display|Dazzling Display]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_, and proficiency with the selected weapon.

**Benefit:** When you spend a swift action to make a performance combat check, you present the weapon in which you have _Weapon Focus_ in a triumphant display. You gain a +2 bonus on the performance combat check and make an Intimidate check to demoralize all foes within 30 feet who can see your display.
