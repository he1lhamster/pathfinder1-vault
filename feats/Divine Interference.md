# Divine Interference

You can convert a spell to interfere with an enemy's attack.

**Prerequisites:** Divine spellcaster, caster level 10th.

**Benefit:** As an immediate action, when an enemy within 30 feet hits an ally with an attack, you can _[[spells/Sacrifice|sacrifice]]_ a prepared divine spell or (if you are a spontaneous caster) an unused spell slot and make the enemy reroll the attack roll. The second attack roll takes a penalty equal to the level of the spell you _sacrifice_. You must _sacrifice_ a spell of 1st-level or higher to use this ability. Whether or not the second attack is successful, you cannot use this effect on the same creature again for 1 day.
