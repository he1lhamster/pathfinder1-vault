# Seeping Darkness (Teamwork)

Your innate magical _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_ seeps through your skin and strengthens when you're near another creature whose soul is as wicked as yours.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Drow|Drow]]_, _darkness_ racial spell-like ability.

**Benefit:** Whenever you're adjacent to a _drow_ ally who also has this feat, you can spend a move action to gain concealment (20% miss chance) for 1 round.
