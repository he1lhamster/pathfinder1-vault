# Monstrous Masquerade

When you disguise yourself as a monstrous humanoid, you can gain some of its qualities.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Monstrous Disguise|Monstrous Disguise]]_, Disguise 9 ranks, Knowledge (nature) 9 ranks.

**Benefit:** When you use the _Monstrous Disguise_ feat to assume the shape of a monstrous humanoid, you can gain a rudimentary version of one of that creature's abilities selected from the following list: climb 10 feet, fly 20 feet (clumsy maneuverability), swim 20 feet, _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_ 3/magic, or _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ 5 to one energy type. Preparing a disguise in this way takes 1 additional hour and costs an extra 500 gp. The bonus ability granted by this feat has a 25% chance to cease functioning every hour after you apply the disguise. This disguise automatically falls apart after 8 hours.
