# Greater Dirge Of Doom

The haunting sound of sepulchral intonations chills the most _[[feats/Stalwart|stalwart]]_ adversary to its very core.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Dirge Of Doom|Improved Dirge of Doom]]_, ability to perform dirge of _[[spells/Doom|doom]]_.

**Benefit:** The effect of your dirge of _doom_ lingers with a target for 2 rounds after the creature leaves the dirge's area of effect. If you use your dirge on a creature that is _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_, it becomes _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_. If you use it on a creature that is _frightened_, it becomes _[[conditions/Panicked|panicked]]_. Once affected by this feat, a creature cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.

**Normal:** _[[universal monster rules/Fear|Fear]]_ effects on a creature end immediately once it leaves the area of dirge of _doom_. A _fear_ effect cannot be made more extreme by dirge of _doom_ and can be changed only to the _frightened_ condition by the _Improved Dirge of Doom_ feat.
