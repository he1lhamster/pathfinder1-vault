# Improvised Weapon Mastery (Combat)

You can turn nearly any object into a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ weapon, from a razor-sharp chair leg to a _[[items/Mundane/Sack|sack]]_ of flour.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Catch Off-Guard|Catch Off-Guard]]_ or _[[feats/Throw Anything|Throw Anything]]_, base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit:** You do not suffer any penalties for using an improvised weapon. Increase the amount of damage dealt by the improvised weapon by one step (for example, 1d4 becomes 1d6) to a maximum of 1d8 (2d6 if the improvised weapon is two-handed). The improvised weapon has a critical threat range of 19-20, with a critical multiplier of ×2.
