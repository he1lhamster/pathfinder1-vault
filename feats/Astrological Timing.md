# Astrological Timing

You can perform more accurate auguries according to planetary movements in relation to the Cosmic Caravan.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to cast _[[spells/Augury|augury]]_ as a spell or spelllike ability.

**Benefit:** You can use a _[[items/Mundane/Cosmogram|cosmogram]]_ or star chart as an optional focus component for _augury_. When you do, the _augury_ can account for consequences up to 1 hour into the future, and your chance of a successful reading increases by 4%. If you also consult a calculating standard orrery or calculating grand orrery, the _augury_ can see up to 1 day into the future and your chance of success increases by 8%.
