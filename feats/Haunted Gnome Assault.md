# Haunted Gnome Assault (Combat)

Discharging your disturbing glamer as you strike a telling blow, you haunt a foe with lingering _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, gnome magic racial trait, _[[feats/Haunted Gnome|Haunted Gnome]]_, Knowledge (arcana) 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** You gain one use of your gnome magic that is independent of your gnome magic _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_. When you _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ to cast a gnome magic spell-like ability for which you have no daily uses remaining, you can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ this independent use to do so. Further, while you are under the effect of _[[spells/Haunted Fey Aspect|haunted fey aspect]]_ (page 230), you can _[[spells/Discharge|discharge]]_ that spell as a free action after you hit an opponent with a charge attack or score a critical hit against an opponent. If you do, that opponent becomes _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 1 round.
