# Versatile Summon Monster

You've learned to _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ a more diverse array of monsters.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank, Knowledge (planes) 1 rank.

**Benefit:** Pick any two templates from the following list (see Simple Summoning Templates below for details): aerial, aqueous, chthonic, dark, fiery, or primordial. When you _summon_ one or more creatures that would normally be available with the celestial, entropic, fiendish, or resolute template using a _summon_ monster spell (or an effect that mimics such a spell), you can instead apply one of the chosen templates to each creature. You can apply a different template to each creature you _summon_.

**Special:** You can select this feat more than once. Each time you do, you can choose an additional two templates.
