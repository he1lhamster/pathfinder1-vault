# Upsetting Shield Style (Combat, Style)

You can strike at weapons to upset enemy attacks.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, proficiency with bucklers.

**Benefit:** You can _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ bash with a _[[items/Armor/Buckler|buckler]]_ as if it were a light _shield_, and you can use the _buckler_ in conjunction with any feats or abilities that normally apply to light shields. While using this style, whenever you successfully deal damage to an opponent with a _shield_ bash using your _buckler_, that opponent takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls made against you until the start of your next turn.
