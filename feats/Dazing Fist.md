# Dazing Fist (Combat)

You know just where to strike to _[[spells/Daze|daze]]_ your foe.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, Wis 13, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit:** You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). _[[feats/Dazing Fist|Dazing Fist]]_ forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A foe who fails this saving throw is _[[conditions/Dazed|dazed]]_ for 1 round, until just before your next turn. You can attempt to use _Dazing Fist_ once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but no more than once per round. Constructs, _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ creatures, plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected by this ability.
