# Peacemaker

Your words of peace ring true and are much more difficult for others to resist.

**Prerequisites:** Charisma 13, good alignment.

**Benefit:** The DC to resist spells you cast to ensure peace or force aggressive creatures to become _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Peaceful|peaceful]]_ increases by +2. This affects spells that dissuade creatures from aggressive actions without exerting long-term or absolute control over them, and without leaving them defenseless. These spells include, but are not limited to, _[[spells/Calm Animals|calm animals]]_, _[[spells/Calm Emotions|calm emotions]]_, command, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Compassionate|compassionate]]_ allyUM, _[[spells/Enthrall|enthrall]]_, euphoric tranquilityUM, _[[spells/Sanctuary|sanctuary]]_, and serenityUM.
