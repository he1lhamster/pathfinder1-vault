# Fling (Combat)

You can throw _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ enemies a short distance, turning them into makeshift missiles against their allies.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Flyby Attack|Flyby Attack]]_, _[[feats/Powerful Wings|Powerful Wings]]_, _[[feats/Snatch And Drop|Snatch and Drop]]_, _[[feats/Throw Anything|Throw Anything]]_.

**Benefit:** Whenever you successfully grapple an opponent using the _Snatch and Drop_ feat, you can instead _[[feats/Fling|fling]]_ your victim at another target. You can throw a creature 10 feet, plus an additional 5 feet for every size category by which it is smaller than you. To strike another target, make a ranged touch attack. If you hit, the attack deals damage to both the creature flung and its intended target. This damage is equal to that of a slam attack of a creature two sizes larger than the creature being flung (see page 302 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary) plus your Strength modifier. The flung creature lands _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ in the nearest adjacent square to the target, and the target must succeed at a Reflex saving throw (DC = 10 + damage dealt) or also fall _prone_ in its own square. You can't use this feat if the weight of the creature you intend to _fling_ exceeds the amount you can carry as a heavy load.
