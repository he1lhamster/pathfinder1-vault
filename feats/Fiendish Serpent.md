# Fiendish Serpent

While transforming into a serpent is most common among fiendish servants of serpentine demigods such as Abraxas or Geryon, worshipers of any fiend might assume this shape.

**Prerequisites:** Bipedal body shape, non-native outsider with the evil subtype.

**Benefit:** You slither upon a serpentine tail that has replaced your legs. This grants you a climb speed and swim speed equal to your base speed, and you can't be tripped.
