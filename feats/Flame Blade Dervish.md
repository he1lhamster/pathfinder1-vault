# Flame Blade Dervish (Combat)

You move effortlessly when wielding a _[[spells/Flame Blade|flame blade]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to cast _flame blade_ as a spell or spell-like ability.

**Benefit:** When you cast _flame blade_, you gain a +10 enhancement bonus to your base speed as long as the spell persists, along with a +4 competence bonus on all Acrobatics checks. You add your Charisma modifier to damage rolls with your _flame blade_, and ignore the first 10 points of fire _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ possessed by a creature you hit with the _flame blade_ for the purposes of determining the damage dealt by the _flame blade_. Against undead foes, you ignore the first 30 points of fire _resistance_. _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|Immunity]]_ to fire still completely protects against damage from your _flame blade_.
