# Flensing Strike

Your slashing sneak attacks tend to slice away swaths of skin and natural armor.

**Prerequisites:** Sneak attack +3d6, bleeding sneak attack _[[classes/Rogue|rogue]]_ trick or _[[universal monster rules/Bleed|bleed]]_ universal monster ability.

**Benefit:** When you successfully inflict sneak attack damage on a foe with a slashing weapon, your attack doesn't go particularly deep, but you do carve away a significant portion of skin and flesh. If this sneak attack inflicts _bleed_ damage, the victim of the sneak attack is _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ by the pain and has its natural armor bonus (if any) reduced by a number of points equal to the number of sneak attack dice you possess. These penalties persist as long as the _bleed_ damage persists. Multiple strikes on the same foe do not stack the _bleed_ damage, but the penalty to natural armor does stack, to a maximum penalty equal to the target's normal full natural armor score.
