# Lightning Rager

Your primal instincts prevent you from being surprised.

**Prerequisites:** _[[spells/Rage|Rage]]_ class feature.

**Benefit:** If caught unawares during a surprise round, you can enter a _rage_ as an immediate action. If you do, you gain a +2 insight bonus to your Armor Class for the remainder of the surprise round.
