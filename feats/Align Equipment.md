# Align Equipment

You gain the ability to _[[feats/Bless Equipment|bless equipment]]_ with abilities that make them more effective against outsiders.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Alignment Channel|Alignment Channel]]_, _Bless Equipment_, caster level 3rd, channel energy class feature.

**Benefit:** In addition to the blessings provided by _Bless Equipment_, you can imbue weapons, shields, and suits of armor with the special abilities listed in the following table. If a special ability is followed by an alignment set in parentheses, you must be able to channel energy capable of healing or harming outsiders of that alignment subtype with _Alignment Channel_. For example, a _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ must have _Alignment Channel_ (good) to _[[spells/Bless|bless]]_ a weapon with the holy special ability, _Alignment Channel_ (law) to _bless_ a _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ with the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Vigilant|vigilant]]_ special ability, and so on. Aligned equipment blessings otherwise follow all the same rules as the equipment blessings granted by _Bless Equipment_.
