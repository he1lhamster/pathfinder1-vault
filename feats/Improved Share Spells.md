# Improved Share Spells

You can _[[feats/Share Spells|share spells]]_ with those you have a magical connection with.

**Prerequisites:** Spellcraft 10 ranks, ability to acquire an animal companion, eidolon, familiar, or special _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_.

**Benefit:** Any non-instantaneous spell (but not any spell-like ability) you cast on yourself can also affect a creature bonded to you (such as an animal companion, eidolon, familiar, or special _mount_). The creature must be within 5 feet of you at the time of casting to receive the benefit. The spell's duration is halved between you and your bonded creature (for example, a spell with a duration of 1 hour has a duration of 30 minutes for both you and your bonded creature). If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the creature if it moves farther than 5 feet away from you. It does not affect the creature again if it returns before the duration expires. You may _share spells_ in this fashion even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of that type. This feat only applies to animal companions, eidolons, familiars, or special mounts gained through a class feature.
