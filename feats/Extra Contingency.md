# Extra Contingency

You can manage multiple _[[spells/Contingency|contingency]]_ effects.

**Prerequisites:** Character level 19th.

**Benefit:** You can have two _contingency_ effects active at one time. If they would both trigger on the same round, one (chosen randomly) does not trigger until 1 round later.

**Normal:** You can benefit from only a single _contingency_ active at a time.
