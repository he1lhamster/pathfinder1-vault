# Deafening Explosion

Your bombs explode with deafening force.

**Prerequisites:** Bomb class feature, _[[monsters/Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]]_.

**Benefit:** You may reduce your bomb damage by one die to give it the ability to deafen the creature struck by it. The bomb must deal fire, force, or sonic damage. If a creature takes a direct hit from your bomb, it must make a saving throw against the bomb's DC or be _[[conditions/Deafened|deafened]]_ for 1 minute. This deafening is in addition to any other effects the bomb would normally have.
