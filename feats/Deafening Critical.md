# Deafening Critical (Combat, Critical)

Your critical hits cause enemies to lose their hearing.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Critical Focus|Critical Focus]]_, base attack bonus +13.

**Benefit:** Whenever you score a critical hit against an opponent, the victim is permanently _[[conditions/Deafened|deafened]]_. A successful Fortitude save reduces the deafness to 1 round. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. This feat has no effect on deaf creatures. This deafness can be cured by _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_, _[[universal monster rules/Regeneration|regeneration]]_, remove deafness, or a similar ability.

**Special:** You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess _[[feats/Critical Mastery|Critical Mastery]]_.
