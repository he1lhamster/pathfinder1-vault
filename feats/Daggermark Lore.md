# Daggermark Lore

You understand the exclusive poisons brewed by your guild far better than the buyers you sell to, and you can deliver them so they are more difficult to weather.

**Prerequisites:** Craft (alchemy) 5 ranks, member of the _[[npcs/Daggermark Poisoner|Daggermark Poisoner]]_'s Guild, poison lore or poison use class feature.

**Benefit:** Choose one poison. When you deliver that poison, the number of saves needed to cure it increases by 1, and the DC to cure it with _[[spells/Neutralize Poison|neutralize poison]]_ increases by 5. Succeeding at the initial save still negates the poison. Typical poisons used by Daggermark poisoners are listed in Pathfinder Player Companion: Alchemy Manual and Pathfinder Chronicles: Guide to the River Kingdoms. Additionally, if you have the poison lore class feature, you're considered to have the poison use class feature for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.
