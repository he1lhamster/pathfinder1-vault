# Cushioning Shield (Shield Mastery)

You let your _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ absorb some of the damage from a fall.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Shield Focus|Shield Focus]]_, base attack bonus +6 or _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_ level 4th.

**Benefit:** When you fall 10 or more feet, you can direct half of the falling damage you would take to your _shield_. This damage ignores the _shield_'s hardness.
