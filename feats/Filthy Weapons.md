# Filthy Weapons (Combat)

You spread _[[spells/Contagion|contagion]]_ with your weapons by covering their business ends in _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Virulent|virulent]]_ muck and sewage.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (dungeoneering) 1 rank, Knowledge (nature) 1 rank.

**Benefit:** You can take a standard action to cover a weapon in decomposing waste, slimy filth, or other _virulent_ agent. The next attack with that weapon that succeeds against a foe exposes the target to _[[diseases/Filth Fever|filth fever]]_. If the attack is a critical hit, the _filth fever_ has an onset time of 1 round, and a save DC equal to 10 + 1/2 your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier.
