# Majesty Of The Yamaraj

The magistrates of death can breathe death and decay. You were in the presence of a final judge once and your soul remembers that moment still.

**Prerequisites:** Channel energy 5d6, _[[monsters/Duskwalker|duskwalker]]_, _[[monsters/Ghost|ghost]]_ _[[classes/Hunter|hunter]]_ racial trait.

**Benefit:** When you channel positive energy to _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ undead, you can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ your _ghost_ _hunter_ racial ability as a free action. Your channeled energy takes the form of spectral beetles and other insectile scavengers, dealing 50% more damage to the undead. You also gain an additional daily use of _ghost_ _hunter_.
