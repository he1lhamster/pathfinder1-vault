# Asura Style (Combat, Style)

_[[spells/Blasphemy|Blasphemy]]_ comes quite naturally to you. When you interrupt your foes' divine spells, you use words, symbols, or gestures so abhorrent to their faith that they are repulsed by your deeds.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 13, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +5 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 5th.

**Benefit:** When you use a _monk_ weapon or unarmed strike to attack a creature that is casting a divine spell, the target is _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ for 1d4 rounds. A target can attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Wisdom modifier) to reduce the duration of the _sickened_ effect to 1 round.
