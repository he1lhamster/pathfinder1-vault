# Mantis Wisdom (Combat)

Your knowledge of vital areas allows you to land _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Debilitating|debilitating]]_ strikes with precision.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Mantis Style|Mantis Style]]_, _[[feats/Stunning Fist|Stunning Fist]]_, _[[spells/Heal|Heal]]_ 6 ranks.

**Benefit:** Treat half your levels in classes other than _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ as _monk_ levels for determining effects you can apply to a target of your _Stunning Fist_ per the _Stunning Fist_ _monk_ class feature. You can also use a standard action and a successful melee touch attack to remove any _Stunning Fist_ effect you have applied to a target. While using _Mantis Style_, you gain a +2 bonus on unarmed attack rolls with which you are using _Stunning Fist_ attempts.
