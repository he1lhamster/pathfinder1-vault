# Ride-By Attack (Combat)

While mounted and charging, you can move, strike at a foe, and then continue moving.

**Prerequisites:** Ride 1 rank, _[[feats/Mounted Combat|Mounted Combat]]_.

**Benefit:** When you are mounted and use the charge action, you may move and attack as if with a standard charge and then move again (continuing the straight line of the charge). Your total movement for the round can't exceed double your mounted speed. You and your _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_ do not provoke an attack of opportunity from the opponent that you attack.
