# Diabolic Humiliation (Combat)

Your humiliating strikes decrease a foe's morale.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_, _[[feats/Diabolic Style|Diabolic Style]]_*; _[[feats/Vital Strike|Vital Strike]]_; _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_ or _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (unarmed strike); base attack bonus +8 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 7th.

**Benefit:** When you successfully stagger a foe with an unarmed strike using _Diabolic Style_, the target becomes further humiliated. The target cannot gain the benefit of any morale bonus for 1 minute after being _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ in this way, and for the duration of that minute, any additional _staggered_ effects it suffers from your attacks of opportunity last for 2 rounds rather than 1. The durations of multiple _staggered_ effects administered in this way stack.

**Special:** A _monk_ of at least 10th level with this feat can select _[[feats/Improved Vital Strike|Improved Vital Strike]]_ as a _monk_ bonus feat.
