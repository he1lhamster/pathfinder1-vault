# Banish Possessor

You are quite skilled at forcing a possessing creature from its host.

**Benefit:** Whenever you cast a spell or use a spell-like ability or supernatural ability that allows a creature that is being possessed by another creature to attempt a new saving throw to end the spell or effect (such as _[[spells/Protection From Evil|protection from evil]]_), the possessed creature can roll the new saving throw twice and take the better of the two results as the actual result.
