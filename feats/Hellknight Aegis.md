# Hellknight Aegis

Your _[[npcs/Hellknight|Hellknight]]_ armor guards you against many threats.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Heavy Armor Proficiency|Heavy Armor Proficiency]]_, base attack bonus +5, must swear allegiance to a single _Hellknight_ order.

**Benefit:** Once per day as a full-round action, you can give your _Hellknight_ armor the _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ condition. Upon doing so, you are affected by one of the following spells (your choice), using your character level as your caster level: _[[spells/Break Enchantment|break enchantment]]_, _[[spells/Neutralize Poison|neutralize poison]]_, _[[spells/Remove Disease|remove disease]]_, or _[[spells/Remove Paralysis|remove paralysis]]_. Once you have used this benefit, your _Hellknight_ armor must be repaired as normal to restore its full bonus to your Armor Class and return its armor check penalty to normal. You can use this ability even if _[[conditions/Paralyzed|paralyzed]]_ or otherwise restrained, but not if you are _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_. For the purposes of this ability, "_Hellknight_ armor" means any armor with the word "_Hellknight_" in its name. You cannot use this ability if your armor is already _broken_.
