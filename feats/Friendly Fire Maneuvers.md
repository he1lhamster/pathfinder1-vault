# Friendly Fire Maneuvers (Combat, Teamwork)

You and your teammates can anticipate one another's ranged attacks and stay out of each others' way.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Point-Blank Shot|Point-Blank Shot]]_, _[[feats/Precise Shot|Precise Shot]]_.

**Benefit:** Allies who also have this feat cannot provide soft cover to enemies, allowing you to make attacks of opportunity against an enemy even if those allies grant you soft cover against that foe's attacks. If an ally who also has this feat casts a spell that targets the area you are in as it allows a Ref lex saving throw to avoid the effect (such as _[[spells/Fireball|fireball]]_), you gain a +4 _[[feats/Dodge|dodge]]_ bonus on that saving throw.
