# Lingering Spell (Metamagic)

You spell clings to existence, slowly fading from the world.

**Benefit:** You may cause an instantaneous spell that affects an area to persist until the beginning of your next turn. Those already in the area suffer no additional _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_, but other creatures or objects entering the area are subject to its effects. A _[[feats/Lingering Spell|lingering spell]]_ with a visual manifestation obscures _[[spells/Vision|vision]]_, providing concealment (20% miss chance) beyond 5 feet and total concealment (50% miss chance) beyond 20 feet. A _lingering spell_ uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
