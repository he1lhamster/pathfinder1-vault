# Aquatic Spell (Metamagic)

You can cast your spells under or into water.

**Benefit:** An _[[feats/Aquatic Spell|aquatic spell]]_ functions normally when _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_ and requires no caster level check to cast, even if it possesses the fire descriptor. In addition, the spell can be cast from the surface into water and still be effective. An _aquatic spell_ uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.
