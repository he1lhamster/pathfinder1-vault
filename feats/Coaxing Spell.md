# Coaxing Spell (Metamagic)

Your charms and enchantments reach the minds of even the lowliest dungeon denizens.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Spell Focus|Spell Focus]]_ (enchantment), Knowledge (dungeoneering) 6 ranks.

**Benefit:** This feat only works with mind-affecting effects. A _[[feats/Coaxing Spell|coaxing spell]]_ affects mindless oozes and vermin as if they weren't mindless, but has no effect on other creature types. A _coaxing spell_ uses a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell's actual level.
