# Subtle Poisoner

You have mastered the art of stealthily and quickly preparing a poisoned weapon.

**Prerequisites:** Sleight of Hand 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** Whenever you draw a weapon, you can apply poison to the weapon as part of the same action. To do so, you must already have the poison in hand and must succeed at a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check. Success means the dose of poison is expended and you poison the weapon without drawing attention to your act. This check is in addition to any other Sleight of Hand checks you attempt to perform the action (such as to draw a hidden weapon). Failure means any creatures present can immediately attempt opposed Perception checks to notice your _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Poisoning|poisoning]]_ attempt. If you fail the check by 5 or more, you also expose yourself to the poison unless you have an ability that would prevent accidental _poisoning_, such as an _[[classes/Alchemist|alchemist]]_'s poison use ability.
