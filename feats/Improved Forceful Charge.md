# Improved Forceful Charge

Enemies fall before this animal's charge.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Forceful Charge|Forceful Charge]]_, _[[feats/Improved Bull Rush|Improved Bull Rush]]_, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, animal companion.

**Benefit:** This animal can bull rush a target that is up to two size categories larger than itself. If it pushes the target at least 10 feet as a result of this bull rush, it can attempt a _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ combat maneuver check against the target as a free action. This _trip_ combat maneuver provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.
