# Hamatulatsu (Combat)

You have mastered a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ fighting form _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Inspired|inspired]]_ by the hideous attacks of the barbed devil.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (unarmed strike).

**Benefit:** Your unarmed attacks can deal either bludgeoning or piercing damage. You decide which type of damage you deal whenever you attack a foe, but you may only choose one type at a time. If you critically hit a foe with your unarmed strike while doing piercing damage, the additional pain caused by the strike causes the foe to become _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ for 1 round (or _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1 round if the target is already _sickened_). Multiple critical hits in a round against a single foe do not increase the duration of the _sickened_ or _staggered_ condition.

**Special:** _[[feats/Hamatulatsu|Hamatulatsu]]_ may be selected as a substitute bonus feat at 6th level by a _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ even if the _monk_ does not otherwise meet the prerequisites. This fighting style is normally only taught to women of the Sisterhood of the Golden Erinyes.
