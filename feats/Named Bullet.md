# Named Bullet (Grit)

You can craft ammunition intended to kill specific foes.

**Prerequisites:** Amateur GunslingerUC feat or grit class feature, GunsmithingUC, base attack bonus +5.

**Benefit:** Whenever you craft ammunition using _[[feats/Gunsmithing|Gunsmithing]]_, you may inscribe a bullet or alchemical cartridge with the name of its intended target. The ammunition gains the _[[spells/Bane|bane]]_ weapon special ability against the chosen creature only. If the ammunition is used to attack any other target, the attack roll is instead made with a -2 penalty. Crafting a _[[spells/Named Bullet|named bullet]]_ costs 1 grit point and reduces your maximum grit points by 1 until the _named bullet_ is fired or destroyed.
