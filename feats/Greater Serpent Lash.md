# Greater Serpent Lash (Combat)

Your ability to disarm and _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ foes off balance with your _[[items/Weapon/Whip|whip]]_ is impressive.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Serpent Lash|Serpent Lash]]_, base attack bonus +4

**Benefit:** When you make a successful disarm or _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ maneuver using the _Serpent Lash_ feat, you can make your additional disarm or _trip_ attempt against any target within your _whip_'s reach. With a reposition maneuver, you can move the target creature to any point within your _whip_'s reach.
