# Wild Speech

You speak with the tongue of men and beasts.

**Prerequisites:** _[[classes/Druid|Druid]]_ level 6th, wild shape class feature.

**Benefit:** When using wild shape to take the form in which you cannot speak (such as an animal), you are able to speak normally in any language you know. This allows you to cast spells with verbal components, speak command words, and activate spell completion and spell trigger items. However, it does not give you the ability to cast spells requiring somatic components unless you also have the _[[feats/Natural Spell|Natural Spell]]_ feat, or cast spells with material components merged into your form. When using wild shape to take the form of an animal, you may use _[[spells/Speak with Animals|speak with animals]]_ to communicate with animals of your assumed form. This is a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your _druid_ level, and you may use it for a number of minutes per day equal to your _druid_ level. These minutes do not have to be consecutive, but must be used in one-minute increments.
