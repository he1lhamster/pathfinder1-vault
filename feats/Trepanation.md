# Trepanation

Through careful study and practice, you have learned how to relieve pressure in the brain to balance the humors, promote health, and ward off outside influence.

**Prerequisites:** _[[spells/Heal|Heal]]_ 5 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 2 ranks.

**Benefit:** You can perform the faith healing occult skill unlockOA even if you can't use _[[universal monster rules/Psychic Magic|psychic magic]]_. If you can cast _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ spells or have the _Psychic_ SensitivityOA feat, you can use faith healing one additional time per day. So long as you have a _[[npcs/Healer|healer]]_'s kitUE or surgeon's toolsUE, you can spend 1 hour performing a full _[[feats/Trepanation|trepanation]]_ on a creature. This procedure requires a _Heal_ check (DC = 20 + the target's Hit Dice). If you're successful, the target gains a +2 insight bonus on saving throws against curses, _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_, and spells from the enchantment (compulsion) school. These effects persist for 1 day per character level you possess. If you fail the check, the target takes 1d3 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma damage. You can perform this procedure on yourself, but the DC increases by 5.
