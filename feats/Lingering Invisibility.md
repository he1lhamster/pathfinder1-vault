# Lingering Invisibility

You remain brief ly translucent after losing _[[spells/Invisibility|invisibility]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Duergar|Duergar]]_.

**Benefit:** When your _invisibility_ ends, you gain concealment for 1 round per minute of duration the _invisibility_ effect had remaining (minimum 1 round). This only occurs if the _invisibility_ is from your racial spell-like ability or a spell you cast. Effects that negate _invisibility_ negate this concealment.
