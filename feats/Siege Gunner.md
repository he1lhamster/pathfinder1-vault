# Siege Gunner (Combat)

Aiming outsized siege weapons poses little difficulty for you.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Siege Engineer|Siege Engineer]]_, Profession (_siege engineer_) 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** You take no size penalty for aiming a directfire siege weapon larger than yourself. If you operate an indirect-fire siege weapon and miss, you misdirect fire by 1 square per range increment.

**Normal:** Direct-fire weapons impose a -2 attack roll penalty per size category by which the weapon is larger than the creature aiming it. An indirect-fire weapon that misses misdirects fire by 1d4 squares per range increment.
