# Whirlwind Attack (Combat)

You can strike out at every foe within reach.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Dodge|Dodge]]_, _[[feats/Mobility|Mobility]]_, _[[feats/Spring Attack|Spring Attack]]_, base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit:** When you use the full-attack action, you can give up your regular attacks and instead make one melee attack at your highest base attack bonus against each opponent within reach. You must make a separate attack roll against each opponent. When you use the _[[feats/Whirlwind Attack|Whirlwind Attack]]_ feat, you also forfeit any bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats, spells, or abilities.
