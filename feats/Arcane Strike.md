# Arcane Strike (Combat)

You draw upon your arcane power to enhance your weapons with magical energy.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to cast arcane spells.

**Benefit:** As a swift action, you can imbue your weapons with a fraction of your power. For 1 round, your weapons deal +1 damage and are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_. For every five caster levels you possess, this bonus increases by +1, to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.
