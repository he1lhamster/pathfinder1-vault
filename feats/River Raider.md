# River Raider (Combat)

You are skilled at _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Creeping|creeping]]_ up on watercraft without being noticed, then swiftly leaping over the side and into combat.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on Swim and Stealth checks while swimming in calm or rough water. In addition, if you're able to act in a surprise round and start it in water, you can take both a move and a standard action. You still can't take a full-round action during the surprise round.

**Normal:** You can take only a move or a standard action during a surprise round in which you can act.
