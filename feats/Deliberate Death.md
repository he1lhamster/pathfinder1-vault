# Deliberate Death

Someone killed you: a monster, a murderer, a soldier, an executioner, it doesn't matter-someone made a conscious decision to end your life.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Duskwalker|Duskwalker]]_.

**Benefit:** Once per day, if you are reduced below 0 hit points as a result of an attack or ability used by another character, as an immediate action you can take a single standard action. You must use this action to attack or _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ the creature that damaged you. At 11th level, you can use this feat a second time per day.
