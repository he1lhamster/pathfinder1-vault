# Stalwart

You adopt a defensive stance that allows you to absorb and redirect hits.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Diehard|Diehard]]_, _[[feats/Endurance|Endurance]]_, base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit:** While using the total defense action, fighting defensively action, or _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, you can forgo the _[[feats/Dodge|dodge]]_ bonus to AC you would normally gain to instead gain an equivalent amount of DR, to a maximum of DR 5/-, until the start of your next turn. This _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_ stacks with DR you gain from class features, such as the _[[classes/Barbarian|barbarian]]_'s, but not with DR from any other source. If you are denied your Dexterity bonus to AC, you are also denied this DR.
