# Startling Shapechange

You use your shapechanging abilities in order to demoralize your enemies.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Dazzling Display|Dazzling Display]]_, _[[universal monster rules/Change Shape|change shape]]_ ability, shapechanger subtype.

**Benefit:** You abruptly _change shape_, startling those who aren't prepared for your reveal. Whenever you use your _change shape_ ability to assume a new form or return to your _[[spells/True Form|true form]]_, you can also use _Dazzling Display_ as a free action. Reduce the result of your Intimidate check by 5 against opponents who know that you are a shapechanger. When using _Dazzling Display_ in this manner, you can use the feat without needing a weapon in hand.

**Special:** A character with the wild shape class feature counts as having the _change shape_ ability and shapechanger subtype for the purpose of meeting this feat's prerequisites. A character with wild shape can use this feat's benefit whenever she uses wild shape to assume a new form or return to her _true form_.
