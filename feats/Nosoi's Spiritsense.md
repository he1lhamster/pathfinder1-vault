# Nosoi's Spiritsense

Even the lowliest psychopomp can sniff out the undead. A whippoorwill in a papier-mache _[[items/Mundane/Mask|mask]]_ taught you how to do it.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Duskwalker|Duskwalker]]_.

**Benefit:** You can cast _[[spells/Detect Undead|detect undead]]_ as a spell-like ability at will. Your caster level for the purpose of this effect is equal to your character level.
