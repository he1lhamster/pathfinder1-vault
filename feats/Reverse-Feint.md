# Reverse-Feint (Combat)

You can goad an opponent into attacking you in order to make your counter attack all the more powerful.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Toughness|Toughness]]_, base attack bonus +1, _[[monsters/Orc|orc]]_.

**Benefit:** As a move action, you can leave a gap in your defenses for one adjacent opponent to use. If the opponent attacks you on its next turn, it gains a +4 bonus on its attack roll. Whether or not the opponent successfully hits, you may attack it as an immediate action with a single melee attack, gaining a +2 bonus on your attack roll.
