# Draconic Glide

You possess draconic defenses and wings that allow you to _[[spells/Glide|glide]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Draconic Aspect|Draconic Aspect]]_, _[[monsters/Kobold|kobold]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus against sleep and _[[universal monster rules/Paralysis|paralysis]]_ effects. You grow a pair of wings that you can use to fall and _glide_ at a safe pace. You can make a DC 15 Fly check to fall safely from any height without taking falling damage, as if using _[[spells/Feather Fall|feather fall]]_. When falling safely, you may make an additional DC 15 Fly check to _glide_, moving 5 feet laterally for every 20 feet you fall.

**Special:** If you have the gliding wings racial trait, you don't need to make a Fly check to _glide_, and you can move 10 feet laterally for every 20 feet you fall.
