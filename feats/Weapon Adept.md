# Weapon Adept (Combat)

You are skilled at using customized weaponry.

**Benefit:** Choose a weapon modification (such as jagged hooks). You treat weapons with that modification as being of their normal category (simple, martial, or exotic).

**Normal:** A modified weapon is treated as one category more difficult to wield.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times, choosing a different weapon modification each time.
