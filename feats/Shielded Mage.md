# Shielded Mage (Shield Mastery)

You have learned how to cast spells from behind the safety of a _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Shield Focus|Shield Focus]]_, base attack bonus +3 or _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_ level 1st.

**Benefit:** You reduce the arcane spell failure of any _shield_ you use by 15% (to a minimum of 0%). Using a _shield_ does not prevent you from completing somatic spell components with the hand wielding the _shield_.
