# Conditional Spell (Metamagic)

You know how to apply restrictions on how a creature can use the benefits of your spells.

**Benefit:** A _[[feats/Conditional Spell|conditional spell]]_ is subject to the rules laid out in the spell _[[spells/Conditional Favor|conditional favor]]_ (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue 206). A _conditional spell_ takes up a spell slot 1 level higher than normal.
