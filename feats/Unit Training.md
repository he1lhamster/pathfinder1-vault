# Unit Training (Teamwork)

Even in the fiercest _[[universal monster rules/Heat|heat]]_ of battle, you can tell the comrades you have trained with from your enemies.

**Prerequisites:** Wild Rager _[[classes/Barbarian|barbarian]]_ archetype (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat).

**Benefit:** When fighting uncontrolled after failing a Will save from the Uncontrolled _[[spells/Rage|Rage]]_ ability, or anytime you are subject to the _[[spells/Confusion|confusion]]_ spell or similar effects, you can still distinguish others you have trained with and who also have this teamwork feat as allies, and are not required to attack them.

**Normal:** Creatures under the effects of a _confusion_ spell or the Uncontrolled _Rage_ _barbarian_ ability may be required to attack the creature nearest to them, be it friend or foe.

**Special:** Note that the ally must not only also have this teamwork feat, but must also have undergone a significant amount of time _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ and fighting alongside you to gain this benefit, left to the GM's discretion. Teamwork feats were introduced in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Player's Guide.
