# Secured Armor (Armor Mastery)

You are adept at using your armor to cover your most vulnerable areas.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +11 or _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_ level 8th, armor _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ class feature, proficiency with _[[classes/Medium|medium]]_ or heavy armor.

**Benefit:** When you are hit by a confirmed critical hit or a sneak attack, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally.

**Special:** This chance stacks with the light _[[universal monster rules/Fortification|fortification]]_ and moderate _fortification_ armor special abilities.
