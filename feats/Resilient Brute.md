# Resilient Brute

You absorb punishment others find _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Half-orc or _[[monsters/Orc|orc]]_.

**Benefit:** Once per day, when a creature confirms a critical hit against you, you may treat half the damage as nonlethal damage. You cannot use this ability if you are immune to nonlethal damage. When your base attack bonus reaches +10, you may use this ability an additional time per day.
