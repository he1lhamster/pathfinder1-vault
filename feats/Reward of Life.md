# Reward of Life

When you lay on hands, you are also healed.

**Prerequisites:** Lay on hands class feature.

**Benefit:** Each time you use your lay on hands ability to _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ a creature other than yourself, you _heal_ a number of hit points equal to your Charisma bonus. This ability has no effect if you use lay on hands to _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ undead.
