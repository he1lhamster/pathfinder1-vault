# Greater Blood Frenzy

Your wounds move you into a deeper frenzy.

**Prerequisites:** Blood frenzy ability, _[[monsters/Sahuagin|sahuagin]]_.

**Benefit:** You no longer take a penalty to AC while in a blood frenzy. In addition, if you strike an enemy with both of your claw attacks-or two or more claw attacks if you have extra limbs-while in a blood frenzy, you can _[[universal monster rules/Rend|rend]]_ (as the special attack), dealing an amount of additional damage equal to your claw damage plus 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus (minimum 0).
