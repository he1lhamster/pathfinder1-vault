# Babau Rogue Talent

Your instinct for combat is much like that of a _[[classes/Rogue|rogue]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 17, babau.

**Benefit:** Choose one _rogue_ talent that adds to sneak attacks (such as bleeding attack or _[[spells/Slow|slow]]_ reactions).

**Special:** You may select this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, you gain a new _rogue_ talent.
