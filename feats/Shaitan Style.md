# Shaitan Style (Combat, Style)

You strike with the caustic forces from within the earth.

**Prerequisites:** Con 13, Wis 15, _[[feats/Elemental Fist|Elemental Fist]]_**, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +9 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 5th.

**Benefit:** You gain one additional _Elemental Fist_ (Advanced Player's Guide 158) attempt per day. While using the _[[feats/Shaitan Style|Shaitan Style]]_ and _Elemental Fist_ feats to deal acid damage, you gain a bonus on acid damage rolls equal to your Wisdom bonus. Further, if your _Elemental Fist_ melee attack misses while you are using it to deal acid damage, you still deal 1d6 points of acid damage to your target.
