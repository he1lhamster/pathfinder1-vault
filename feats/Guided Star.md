# Guided Star (Combat)

The _[[spells/Grace|grace]]_ of Desna guides your _[[items/Weapon/Starknife|starknife]]_ to its target and back to your hand.

**Prerequisites:** Starry GraceUI, worshiper of Desna.

**Benefit:** You can empower a _starknife_ with magical power once per day per character level as a swift action. Until the end of your turn, add your Wisdom modifier to your damage rolls with the _starknife_ in addition to any other modifiers you normally add. If you throw the _starknife_ during that time, it returns to you at the beginning of your next turn (as per the _[[spells/Returning Weapon|returning weapon]]_ special ability).
