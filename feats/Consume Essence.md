# Consume Essence (Combat, Monster)

Creatures that you swallow are quickly absorbed and soon utterly annihilated.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +6; evil alignment; _[[universal monster rules/Swallow Whole|swallow whole]]_ universal monster ability; must be of the magical beast, outsider, or undead type.

**Benefit:** When you start your turn having swallowed at least one creature, each swallowed creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or gain a temporary negative level. Swallowed creatures that die from these negative levels are consumed as per _[[spells/Disintegrate|disintegrate]]_. This is a death effect.

**Special:** If you are of the undead type, each time a swallowed creature gains a temporary negative level from this ability, you add 5 temporary hit points to the number of hit points that swallowed creatures must deal to escape, up to a maximum of 15 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 10 minutes.
