# Mocking Dance (Combat, Performance)

You do a little dance that mocks your foe and entertains the crowd.

**Prerequisites:** Acrobatics 4 ranks or Perform (dance) 4 ranks.

**Benefit:** When you spend a swift action to make a performance combat check, before making that check you can either move 5 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity, or you can move your speed and provoke attacks of opportunity. You cannot end this move in a space where you threaten an enemy. If you do move at least 5 feet, you gain a +2 bonus on the performance combat check.
