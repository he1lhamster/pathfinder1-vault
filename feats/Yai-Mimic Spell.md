# Yai-Mimic Spell (Metamagic)

You have studied the magical nature of giant oni and can use your spells to imitate their esoteric features.

**Prerequisites:** Int 15, _[[feats/Still Spell|Still Spell]]_.

**Benefit:** You can modify a ray spell to issue from the center of your forehead, where the _[[items/Wondrous Item/Third Eye|third eye]]_ would be on a yai. This spell doesn't require somatic components. When the spell is cast, you gain _[[universal monster rules/Regeneration|regeneration]]_ 1 for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell. This _regeneration_ can't regrow lost body parts or reattach severed limbs. Fire or acid damage suppresses this _regeneration_ for 1 round, which counts against the total duration of the _regeneration_ effect. A _[[feats/Yai-Mimic Spell|yai-mimic spell]]_ uses up a spell slot 3 levels higher than the spell's actual level.
