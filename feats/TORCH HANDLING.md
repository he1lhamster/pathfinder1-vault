# TORCH HANDLING

In your _[[spells/Grasp|grasp]]_, a simple _[[items/Mundane/Torch|torch]]_ becomes a beacon.

**Benefit:** You gain three benefits upon taking this feat. First, you treat torches as simple weapons. Second, the radius of normal and increased illumination shed by any _torch_ or mundane light source you carry increases by 10 feet. Finally, once per day you may reroll a single saving throw to resist any effect that would otherwise extinguish your light source, such as having water thrown at you, being targeted by a _[[spells/Quench|quench]]_ spell, and so on.
