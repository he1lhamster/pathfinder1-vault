# Ray Shield (Combat)

You can even deflect rays with your _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15, _[[feats/Missile Shield|Missile Shield]]_, _[[items/Weapon/Spellbreaker|Spellbreaker]]_.

**Benefit:** You must be using a light, heavy, or _[[items/Shield/Tower shield|tower shield]]_ to use this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with a ranged touch attack (including rays and similar magical effects), you may def lect it so that you take no damage from it. Your _shield_ suffers the full effects of the spell or effect, if applicable.
