# Blissful Spell (Metamagic)

The absolute peace of Nirvana infuses your spells, giving pause to foes and granting boldness to allies.

**Benefit:** You can alter any spell that targets a single creature to become a _[[feats/Blissful Spell|blissful spell]]_, although the exact effects of the metamagic vary depending on whether the spell is beneficial or offensive. A creature successfully hit by an offensive _blissful spell_ (if the spell requires an attack roll) or that fails its saving throw against an offensive _blissful spell_ takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls for 1 round. A beneficial _blissful spell_ instead grants affected creatures a +2 morale bonus on skill checks and saving throws for 1 round in addition to its normal effects. A _blissful spell_ gains the good descriptor, and the additional effect is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. A _blissful spell_ uses a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's normal spell level. Spells with the evil descriptor can't be blissful spells.
