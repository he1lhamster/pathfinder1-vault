# Terrifying Assault (Combat)

Your foes flee when you appear suddenly.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Frightening Ambush|Frightening Ambush]]_, Intimidate 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** When using Intimidate to demoralize an opponent during a surprise round, if you exceed the DC by 10 or more, you can make the target _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_ for 1 round instead of _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_.
