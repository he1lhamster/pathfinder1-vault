# Branded for Retribution

You _[[spells/Brand|brand]]_ an enemy with your _[[spells/Bane|bane]]_ weapon, making it more vulnerable to your allies' attacks.

**Prerequisites:** _Bane_ class feature.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ 3 rounds of your _bane_ class feature and make a melee touch attack with the weapon affected by _bane_. If you hit, your target takes no damage but is branded until the start of your next turn. While this _brand_ remains, your allies' weapons are considered to have the _bane_ ability with which your weapon is imbued when they attack the branded creature.
