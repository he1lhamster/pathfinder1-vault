# Eye of the Arclord

Your understanding of the esoteric teachings of the Arclords of Nex allows you to open an eldritch eye that grants you superior perception of the magical world.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks, ability to cast arcane spells.

**Benefit:** Once per day as a standard action, you can open an incandescent _[[items/Wondrous Item/Third Eye|third eye]]_ upon your forehead. The eye can remain open for 1 minute, during which time you cast all _[[spells/Divination|divination]]_ spells at +1 caster level (as long as you begin casting the spell before the eye closes), gain _[[spells/Darkvision|darkvision]]_ 60 feet, and can use _[[spells/Detect Magic|detect magic]]_ (as the spell of the same name). You gain a +8 bonus on Perception checks to notice _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ creatures while the eye is open as well.
