# Harder They Fall (Combat, Teamwork)

You can work with an ally to move or _[[spells/Knock|knock]]_ over a foe that's too large for either of you to overcome alone.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_.

**Benefit:** When you use aid another to grant an ally who also has this feat a +2 bonus on the attack roll for a bull rush or _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ combat maneuver, the ally can attempt that maneuver even against foes two or more size categories larger than herself.
