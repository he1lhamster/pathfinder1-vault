# Bladed Brush (Combat)

You know how to balance a polearm perfectly, striking with artful, yet _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ precision.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_[[items/Weapon/Glaive|glaive]]_), must be a worshiper of Shelyn.

**Benefit:** You can use the _[[feats/Weapon Finesse|Weapon Finesse]]_ feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a _glaive_ sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon. When wielding a _glaive_, you can treat it as a one-handed piercing or slashing melee weapon and as if you were not making attacks with your off-hand for all feats and class abilities that require such a weapon (such as a duelist's or _[[classes/Swashbuckler|swashbuckler]]_'s _[[feats/Precise Strike|precise strike]]_). As a move action, you can shorten your grip on the _glaive_, treating it as though it lacked the reach weapon property. You can adjust your grip to grant the weapon the reach property as a move action.
