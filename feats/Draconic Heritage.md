# Draconic Heritage

The power of dragons flows through your veins and you have awakened its potential.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13.

**Benefit:** Choose one type of dragon from the options presented below. You gain the _[[feats/Draconic Heritage|draconic heritage]]_ ability from your chosen dragon type. The save DCs of any associated ability are equal to 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier.

**Special:** You can take this feat only once. If you ever gain a _[[classes/Bloodrager|bloodrager]]_ or _[[classes/Sorcerer|sorcerer]]_ bloodline, you must take draconic as your chosen bloodline (or a bloodline tied to some other creature of the dragon type, as approved by your GM).
