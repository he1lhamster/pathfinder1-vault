# Blundering Defense (Combat)

Your feverish and sometimes comical defensive techniques offer enough _[[universal monster rules/Distraction|distraction]]_ to aid allies.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Cautious Fighter|Cautious Fighter]]_, halfling.

**Benefit:** Whenever you fight defensively or use the total defense action, allies gain a luck bonus to AC and CMD equal to 1/2 the _[[feats/Dodge|dodge]]_ bonus you gain from the action you are taking. Allies only gain this bonus while they are adjacent to you.
