# Nanite Disruption

You can use your nanite surge to inflict wounds upon other mechanical beings.

**Prerequisites:** Nanite surge racial trait.

**Benefit:** As long as you are adjacent to an _[[monsters/Android|android]]_, a robot, or a creature primarily made of electronic components (GM's discretion), you can use your nanite surge ability as an immediate action to short-circuit that creature's hardware. If you succeed at a melee touch attack and the target fails a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + 1/2 your Constitution modif ier), it takes a penalty equal to 1 + 1/2 your level (minimum 0) on its next d20 roll. This penalty lasts until the beginning of your next turn.
