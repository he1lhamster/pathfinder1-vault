# Cleansing Burst

Your channeled energy wards off disease.

**Prerequisites:** Able to cast _[[spells/Remove Disease|remove disease]]_ or the ability to cure disease with a mercy, channel positive energy class feature.

**Benefit:** When you channel positive energy to _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ or _[[feats/Turn Undead|turn undead]]_ creatures, any undead creatures in the area lose the ability to cause disease with their melee and ranged attacks for 1d4+1 rounds. If an undead creature successfully saves against your channeled energy, this duration is reduced to 1 round for that creature. _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|Immunity]]_ to positive energy negates this ability. When you channel positive energy to _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ living creatures, any living creatures in the area gain a +4 _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sacred|sacred]]_ bonus on saving throws against disease for 1d4+1 rounds. Creatures not healed by positive energy receive no benefit.
