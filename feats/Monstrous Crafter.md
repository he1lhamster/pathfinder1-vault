# Monstrous Crafter

You can weave pieces of beasts into your magic items.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Craft Wondrous Item|Craft Wondrous Item]]_, _[[feats/Grisly Ornament|Grisly Ornament]]_, _[[feats/Harvest Parts|Harvest Parts]]_.

**Benefit:** Whenever you use the _Grisly Ornament_ feat, you are able to permanently integrate one ornament you have crafted using the harvested creature parts into a wondrous item. The ornament grants no ongoing benefits, but once per day you can activate an integrated ornament as a free action to gain its full benefits for 1 minute. You can integrate an ornament into a wondrous item (or replace an item's existing ornament) by spending 8 hours of work and 100 gp x the creature's CR.
