# Combat Distraction

Anyone who attacks you while you act like a lunatic exposes themselves to brutal counterattacks from your allies.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Goblin|Goblin]]_, Acrobatics 1 rank, Escape Artist 1 rank.

**Benefit:** As a full-round action, you can choose to do something that seems to serve no useful purpose. Example actions could include laughing at another creature's misfortune, rooting in your pockets for a snack, bending over to pick up what looks like a _[[spells/Weird|weird]]_ bug, or trying to fly into the air by flapping your arms like a sea gull.Although you're acting like a lunatic, your unpredictable actions are _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Distracting|distracting]]_. Any creature other than a _goblin_ within 5 feet of you takes a -2 penalty on Perception checks and concentration checks for as long as you continue to be a _[[universal monster rules/Distraction|distraction]]_ and remain in range. This penalty stacks with other goblins performing combat distractions, as long as you're both adjacent to the distracted target.
