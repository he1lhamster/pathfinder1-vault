# Extra Croaking

Your vocal chords are especially tough and allow you to croak more often.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Boggard|Boggard]]_, terrifying croak.

**Benefit:** You gain one extra use of terrifying croak per hour. If your _[[spells/Recharge|recharge]]_ time is less than 1 hour, you instead gain an extra use each time the ability recharges.
