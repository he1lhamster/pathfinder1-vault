# Devil's Foe (Achievement)

Once you were just another _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ victim, but now even the deepest pits of Hell ring with the lamentations of your adversaries.

**Prerequisites:** Face 10 different devils in combat and take damage or suffer some other sort of injury from five or more attacks made by each one without falling _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_, fleeing, or otherwise becoming unable to _[[feats/Strike Back|strike back]]_ at them.

**Benefit:** Your attacks count as good-aligned for the purposes of bypassing the _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_ of devils.
