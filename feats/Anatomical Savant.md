# Anatomical Savant (Combat)

You know how to perform _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ strikes against even the most nebulous of targets.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_, base attack bonus +12.

**Benefit:** Choose one weapon with which you have the _Weapon Focus_ feat. When you strike an opponent that has a chance of _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Negating|negating]]_ critical hits or sneak attacks, such as from the _[[universal monster rules/Fortification|fortification]]_ armor special ability, reduce that chance by 25%. Treat creatures that are normally immune to critical hits and sneak attacks as instead having a 75% chance to negate the critical hit or sneak attack, taking only the attack's normal damage.

**Special:** You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a different weapon.
