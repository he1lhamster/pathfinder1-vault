# Horde Charge (Teamwork)

When you charge with an ally, you are more _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +1, half-orc or _[[monsters/Orc|orc]]_.

**Benefit:** When charging during the same round as an ally with this feat, you gain a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls in addition to the normal bonus for charging. If you can make multiple attacks on a charge, this bonus only applies to the first attack.
