# Fearsome Spell (Metamagic)

Your spells inspire great _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ in those harmed by them.

**Benefit:** When a creature takes damage from a _[[feats/Fearsome Spell|fearsome spell]]_, if that creature failed its save against the spell, it becomes _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for a number of rounds equal to the spell's original level. If the spell doesn't allow a save, creatures harmed by it can attempt a Will save (against the same DC the spell would have if it did allow a save) to negate the _shaken_ effect. If the spell effect already causes creatures to become _shaken_, on a failed save, add the duration of this metamagic effect to the duration of the _shaken_ condition imposed by the spell. A _fearsome spell_ can't cause a creature to become _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_, even if that creature is already _shaken_. A _fearsome spell_ uses up a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell's actual level.
