# Graceful Athlete

You can use your lean, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Agile|agile]]_ body to scale tall heights.

**Prerequisites:** Acrobatics 1 rank, Climb 1 rank, Swim 1 rank, racial bonus to Dexterity.

**Benefit:** Add your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength bonus to _Climb_ and Swim checks. If you have a Strength penalty, you must apply both your Strength penalty and your Dexterity modifier. This feat grants no benefit to creatures that already add their Dexterity modifier to _Climb_ and Swim checks (such as all Tiny or smaller creatures).

**Special:** Investigators, rogues (including unchained roguesPU), and slayers can select this feat in place of an _[[classes/Investigator|investigator]]_ talent, a _[[classes/Rogue|rogue]]_ talent, or a _[[classes/Slayer|slayer]]_ talent, respectively, if they meet the prerequisites.
