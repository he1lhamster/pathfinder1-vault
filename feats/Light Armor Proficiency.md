# Armor Proficiency, Light (Combat)

You are skilled at wearing light armor.

**Benefit:** When you wear a type of armor with which you are proficient, the armor check penalty for that armor applies only to Dexterity- and Strength-based skill checks.

**Normal:** A character who is wearing armor with which he is not proficient applies its armor check penalty to attack rolls and to all skill checks that involve moving.

**Special:** All characters except monks, sorcerers, and wizards automatically have _[[feats/Light Armor Proficiency|Light Armor Proficiency]]_ as a bonus feat. They need not select it.
