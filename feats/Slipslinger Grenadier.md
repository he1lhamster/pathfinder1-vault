# Slipslinger Grenadier (Combat)

You can hurl splash weapons with your _[[items/Weapon/Sling|sling]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Slipslinger Style|Slipslinger Style]]_, _[[feats/Throw Anything|Throw Anything]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_sling_) or weapon _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ (thrown) class feature, warslinger racial traitARG.

**Benefit:** While using _Slipslinger Style_, as a standard action you can use a _sling_ to hurl an alchemical splash weapon, treating it as a _sling_ bullet for the purpose of drawing and loading it into your _sling_. Your _sling_ deals its normal weapon damage, plus the loaded splash weapon's effect or damage. This extra damage is not multiplied on a critical hit.

**Special:** This feat cannot be used with alchemists' bombs.
