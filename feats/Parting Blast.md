# Parting Blast

When you die, your body explodes in one final, destructive kinetic blast.

**Prerequisites:** Kinetic blast class feature.

**Benefit:** You can accept 1 point of _[[universal monster rules/Burn|burn]]_ to prepare a kinetic blast that automatically triggers upon your death. If you are killed at any point before your _burn_ is removed, your body instantly erupts in an explosion that deals an amount of damage equal to that of your simple blast to all creatures in a 5-foot radius. A _[[feats/Parting Blast|parting blast]]_ destroys your body, which might prevent any magic that requires an intact corpse.
