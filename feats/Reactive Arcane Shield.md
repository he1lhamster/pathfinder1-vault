# Reactive Arcane Shield

Your _[[feats/Arcane Shield|arcane shield]]_ responds to threats even if you're caught off _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Arcane ShieldAPG, arcane spellcaster, caster level 12th.

**Benefit:** If you are aware of an attack against you that has already been declared and you choose to use the Arcane ShieldAPG feat, the immediate action to activate the feat occurs before the attack roll against you is resolved. In addition, all adjacent allies also gain the feat's def lection bonus to AC for 1 round.
