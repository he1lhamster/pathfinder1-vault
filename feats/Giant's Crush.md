# Giant's Crush (Combat)

When you strike hard, you _[[spells/Knock|knock]]_ smaller foes off their feet.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, _[[feats/Vital Strike|Vital Strike]]_, base attack bonus +6, giant subtype.

**Benefit:** If you hit a creature at least one size category smaller than you with a melee attack while using both _Power Attack_ and _Vital Strike_, the creature that you attacked is also knocked _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_. A successful Ref lex save negates this effect (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus). You must choose to use this feat before making the attack roll.

**Special:** This effect stacks with the effect of Giant's Wallop.
