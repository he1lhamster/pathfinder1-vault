# Improved Balor Whip (Combat)

You can _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ in foes with your _[[items/Weapon/Whip|whip]]_ and attack them with your sword.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Balor Whip|Balor Whip]]_*, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_whip_), _Whip_ MasteryUC, base attack bonus +12.

**Benefit:** When you succeed at a drag attempt with your _whip_ against a non-adjacent target and the target ends the drag adjacent to you, as a free action you can make a single attack against the target at your highest attack bonus using the melee weapon held in your other hand. You gain an additional +2 bonus on drag combat maneuver checks when using a _whip_ to drag, but this bonus does not stack with the bonus from _[[feats/Greater Drag|Greater Drag]]_.
