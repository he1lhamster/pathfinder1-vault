# Shield Material Expertise (Shield Mastery)

You emphasize and exploit the potential of the special material from which your _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ is made.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Shield Focus|Shield Focus]]_, base attack bonus +6 or _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_ level 4th.

**Benefit:** When wielding a _shield_ made of one of the materials listed below, you can use the listed ability twice per day. Darkwood: As a free action as part of an attack with your _shield_, you can drive splinters of your _shield_ into your opponent, dealing an amount of _[[universal monster rules/Bleed|bleed]]_ damage equal to 1 + the _shield_'s enhancement bonus. Dragonhide: As an immediate action when you take energy damage of the type to which the dragonhide _shield_ is immune, you can reduce the amount of damage you take by 10 hit points. Living SteelUE: As a free action as part of an attack with your _shield_, you can attempt a sunder combat maneuver check against a metal weapon wielded by your target. If you succeed at the attempt, the weapon gains the _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ condition; if the weapon already has the _broken_ condition, it is destroyed.
