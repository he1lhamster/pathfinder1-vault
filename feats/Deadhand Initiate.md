# Deadhand Initiate (Combat)

Your adulation of death not only shields you from your fears, it allows you to feed on them.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 19, _[[feats/Deadhand Style|Deadhand Style]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, Knowledge (religion) 6 ranks, ki pool class feature, nongood alignment.

**Benefit:** While using _Deadhand Style_, as long as you have at least 1 point in your ki pool, your bonus on saving throws against _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effects increases to +4, and the DC of Intimidate checks attempted against you increases by 8. Additionally, if an enemy targets you with a _fear_ effect, you can spend 1 point from your ki pool as an immediate action to gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice your Hit Dice.
