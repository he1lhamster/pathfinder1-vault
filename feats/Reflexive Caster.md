# Reflexive Caster

You are ready to defend yourself with a spell at a moment's notice.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_, caster level 5th.

**Benefit:** If you fail a Perception check that results in you being unable to act in a surprise round, you still roll initiative normally. You can act on your initiative count in the surprise round, but can only take a standard action to cast an abjuration spell that targets only yourself.
