# Dirty Fighting (Combat)

You can take advantage of a distracted foe.

**Benefit:** When you attempt a combat maneuver check against a foe you are flanking, you can forgo the +2 bonus on your attack roll for flanking to instead have the combat maneuver not provoke an attack of opportunity. If you have a feat or ability that allows you to attempt the combat maneuver without provoking an attack of opportunity, you can instead increase the bonus on your attack roll for flanking to +4 for the combat maneuver check.

**Special:** This feat counts as having Dex 13, Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, and _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_ for the purposes of meeting the prerequisites of the various improved combat maneuver feats, as well as feats that require those improved combat maneuver feats as prerequisites.
