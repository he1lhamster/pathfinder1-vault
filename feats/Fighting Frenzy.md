# Fighting Frenzy (Combat, Teamwork)

You feed off the _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ of your allies.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, _rage_ class feature.

**Benefit:** When you are in a _rage_ and an ally with this feat within 60 feet is in a _rage_, you don't take the normal -2 penalty to AC for being in a _rage_. If you would take a larger penalty to AC for being in a _rage_, reduce that penalty by 2.
