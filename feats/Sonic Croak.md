# Sonic Croak

Your croak creates powerful sound waves that you can direct at fragile targets.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Throat Pouch|Throat Pouch]]_*, _[[monsters/Boggard|boggard]]_, terrifying croak.

**Benefit:** When you use your terrifying croak ability, instead of it imparting its normal effect, you can choose to deal 1d4 points of sonic damage to creatures in a 15-foot cone (Fortitude half ). The DC of this Fortitude save is the same as that of your terrifying croak. For every 3 Hit Dice you possess, the damage dealt increases by 1d4.

**Special:** The _Throat Pouch_ feat increases the size of this feat's cone by 5 feet for every 6 HD you have, not every 2 HD.
