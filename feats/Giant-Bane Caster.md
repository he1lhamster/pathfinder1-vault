# Giant-Bane Caster

You can apply your specialized knowledge of giants' weaknesses in order to make your spells harder for giants to resist.

**Prerequisites:** Caster level 4th, favored enemy (giants) class feature.

**Benefit:** Add 1/2 your favored enemy bonus against giants to the DC of all saving throws against spells you cast against creatures with the giant subtype, as well as to caster level checks made to overcome the _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ of creatures with the giant subtype.
