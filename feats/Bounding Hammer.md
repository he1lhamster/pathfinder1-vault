# Bounding Hammer (Combat)

You can throw a _[[items/Mundane/Hammer|hammer]]_ so it rebounds near you.

**Prerequisites:** Proficiency with _hammer_, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you may throw a _hammer_ at an opponent within 20 feet. If you hit (whether or not the attack damages the target), the _hammer_ rebounds off of the creature and lands in your square. If you have the _[[feats/Snatch Arrows|Snatch Arrows]]_ feat, you may choose to catch the _hammer_ when it enters your square (though this does not give you the ability to immediately throw the _hammer_). This ability may not work against some creatures or in certain circumstances as determined by the GM; for example, your weapon does not bounce off _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ creatures (unless it has the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]]_ ability), it may stick to creatures with the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Adhesive|adhesive]]_ ability, the slowing effect of fighting _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_ prevents you from using this feat, and so on.

**Normal:** A thrown weapon drops in the square where it hit its target.
