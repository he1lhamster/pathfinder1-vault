# Stone Singer

Your songs are in accordance with the ways and lands of your people.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, bardic performance class feature, dwarf.

**Benefit:** When you use bardic performance with audible components underground, the range or area of your chosen performance is doubled, and you can affect deaf creatures if they possess _[[universal monster rules/Tremorsense|tremorsense]]_ and are in your new range. In addition, the DC for saving throws against your bardic performance is increased by +2 for creatures of the earth subtype, regardless of where the performance occurs.
