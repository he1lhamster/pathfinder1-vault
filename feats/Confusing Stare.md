# Confusing Stare (Combat, Stare)

Your stare addles your foe's mind.

**Prerequisites:** _[[classes/Mesmerist|Mesmerist]]_ level 7th, painful stare class feature.

**Benefit:** When you trigger your painful stare, the target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your _mesmerist_ level + your Charisma modifier) or else become _[[conditions/Confused|confused]]_ for 1 round. The target must roll twice to determine the result of its _confused_ condition, and you select which roll is used.
