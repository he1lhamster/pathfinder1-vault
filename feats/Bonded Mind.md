# Bonded Mind (Teamwork)

You and your partner are so close that you can almost read each other's minds.

**Benefit:** As long as you can see each other, you and an ally who also has this feat can trade nonverbal messages. These function as the _[[spells/Message|message]]_ spell, except that you don't need to whisper or point, and you cannot be overheard.
