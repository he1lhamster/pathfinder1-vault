# Shadows Of Fear (Combat)

Your enemies' _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ causes them to _[[spells/Jump|jump]]_ at shadows, diverting their attention.

**Prerequisites:** Hidden strike +2d8 or sneak attack +2d6.

**Benefit:** The first time each round that you hit a creature suffering from a _fear_ effect, you can deal hidden strike or sneak attack damage as if you were flanking that creature (improved uncanny _[[feats/Dodge|dodge]]_ and other effects that prevent flanking also prevent a hidden strike or sneak attack from this feat).
