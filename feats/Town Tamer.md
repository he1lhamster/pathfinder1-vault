# Town Tamer (Story)

This town needs cleaning up, and you're just the one to do it.

**Prerequisites:** You must have 5 ranks in Intimidate and a personal motivation to clean up a particular town (such as an old friend calling in a favor, or seeking a place to settle down), or you must have the _[[npcs/Bounty Hunter|Bounty Hunter]]_ or _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Champion|Champion]]_ of the People background.

**Benefit:** Choose a particular settlement. When you're in your chosen settlement, the DC of Intimidate checks made against you increases by 10. You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 _[[feats/Dodge|dodge]]_ bonus to AC against undesirable elements like criminals or ruffians in your chosen settlement. This bonus increases to +2 for combat maneuver checks.

**Goal:** Defeat 10 more troublemakers in your chosen settlement with a CR equal to your character level or higher, and in the process eliminate a serious criminal threat or otherwise clean up the streets.

**Completion Benefit:** You gain the ability to designate a new chosen settlement as often as you _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_. You must first live in a settlement for 1 week to make it your chosen settlement. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks and a +1 bonus on saving throws when in your chosen settlement.
