# Aversion Tolerance

You have been hunted for so long that you have developed resistances to slayers' usual _[[spells/Scare|scare]]_ tactics.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Vampire|Vampire]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on saves made to resist aversions to objects, sounds, and materials appropriate to your _vampire_ type (such as _[[items/Mundane/Garlic|garlic]]_, holy symbols, and mirrors for a moroi). When confronted with such things, you can attempt a saving throw immediately instead of after 1 round.
