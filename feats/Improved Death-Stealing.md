# Improved Death-Stealing

Your death-stealing _[[universal monster rules/Gaze|gaze]]_ creates more powerful undead.

**Prerequisites:** Nabasu, _[[feats/Ability Focus|Ability Focus]]_ (death-stealing _gaze_)

**Benefit:** When you would normally create a _[[monsters/Ghoul|ghoul]]_ with your death-stealing _gaze_, you instead create a ghast. As a free action, you may also spend a number of growth points in order to even further augment your new undead minion as it is created. If you spend 1 growth point, you create a _[[monsters/Wight|wight]]_ instead of a ghast. If you spend 3 growth points, you create a _[[monsters/Wraith|wraith]]_ instead of a ghast. And if you spend 5 growth points, you transform the target into a juju zombie instead of a ghast. Note that spending growth in this manner reduces your statistics as appropriate.
