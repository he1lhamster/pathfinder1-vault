# Psychic Healing

The spirit finds ways to _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ the body, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Guided|guided]]_ by your faith.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 11, _[[feats/Psychic Sensitivity|Psychic Sensitivity]]_ or the ability to cast _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ spells, _Heal_ 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** As an additional use of the faith healing skill unlock, you can attempt to manipulate a creature's _psychic_ form to _heal_ damage to its physical form. This works as the treat _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ wounds use of the _Heal_ skill, but also grants the creature a number of temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage healed. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour. _[[feats/Psychic Healing|Psychic healing]]_ doesn't require a _[[items/Mundane/Healer's kit|healer's kit]]_. A creature can benef it from _psychic healing_ only once per day, and can't benef it from both this ability and treat _deadly_ wounds in the same day.
