# Improved Impaling Critical (Combat, Critical)

When you impale a target, you _[[feats/Hinder|hinder]]_ its movement and can cause severe bleeding.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Impaling Critical|Impaling Critical]]_, _[[feats/Critical Focus|Critical Focus]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Specialization|Weapon Specialization]]_ with selected piercing melee weapon, base attack bonus +13.

**Benefit:** While you are using _Impaling Critical_ to impale an opponent, and you are still holding onto that weapon, that opponent must succeed at a grapple combat maneuver check against you to _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ your weapon out. If you have let go of your weapon, the impaled opponent must spend a standard action to remove the weapon. Until the opponent pulls the weapon out, his speed in all modes is halved and his maneuverability, if any, is reduced by one step. When the weapon comes out, instead of dealing the damage normal for _Impaling Critical_, you can deal _[[universal monster rules/Bleed|bleed]]_ damage equal to your weapon's damage dice result once per round at the start of that opponent's turn.
