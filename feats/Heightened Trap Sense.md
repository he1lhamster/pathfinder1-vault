You are acutely attentive to the subtleties of traps and how they are hidden.

**Prerequisites:** Search 6 ranks, trap sense +1.

**Benefit:** When you pass within 5 feet of a trap, you are entitled to an automatic Search check to notice the trap. This check is made at a -10 penalty, or -5 if you are moving at half speed and taking no actions other than moving.

**Normal:** You must take an action to actively search.
