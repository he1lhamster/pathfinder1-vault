# Painful Blow (Combat)

You have learned how to land blows so painful it is difficult for struck spellcasters to concentrate.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Vital Strike|Vital Strike]]_, base attack bonus +6, Knowledge (arcana) 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** When you use _Vital Strike_ (or _[[feats/Improved Vital Strike|Improved Vital Strike]]_ or _[[feats/Greater Vital Strike|Greater Vital Strike]]_), the creature you hit with the attack must treat the damage dealt as continuous damage until the beginning of your next turn. This forces the target to attempt a concentration check if it casts a spell (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 206). You can use this benefit twice per day, or three times per day if your base attack bonus is +12 or higher.
