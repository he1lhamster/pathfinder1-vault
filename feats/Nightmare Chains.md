# Nightmare Chains

Chains are a _[[monsters/Kyton|kyton]]_'s inheritance and dominion.

**Prerequisites:** _Kyton_ subtype, 5 or more Hit Dice.

**Benefit:** You gain the _kyton_'s _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Dancing|dancing]]_ chains ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 185), except you can control only up to two chains this way. This grants you two chain attacks, which deal damage as per a _[[items/Weapon/Spiked chain|spiked chain]]_ made for a creature of your size. If you already have the _dancing_ chains ability, you can control two additional chains.

**Special:** At the GM's discretion, non-kyton outsiders can select this feat if they have a thematic link to chains (such as horned devils or demonic servants of Shivaska).
