# Serpentine Compression

You can _[[spells/Squeeze|squeeze]]_ through small areas thanks to your slippery scales and lithe musculature.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Serpentfolk|Serpentfolk]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain the _[[universal monster rules/Compression|compression]]_ universal monster ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 295), allowing you to move through an area as small as one-quarter your space without squeezing, or one-eighth your space when squeezing.
