# Expanded Arcana

Your research has revealed new spells.

**Prerequisites:** Caster level 1st, see Special.

**Benefit:** Add one spell from your class's spell list to your list of spells known. This is in addition to the number of spells normally gained at each new level in your class. You may instead add two spells from your class's spell list to your list of spells known, but both of these spells must be at least one level lower than the highest level spell you can cast in that class. Once made, these choices cannot be changed.

**Special:** You can only take this feat if you possess levels in a class whose spellcasting relies on a limited list of spells known, such as the _[[classes/Bard|bard]]_, _[[classes/Oracle|oracle]]_, and _[[classes/Sorcerer|sorcerer]]_. You can gain _[[feats/Expanded Arcana|Expanded Arcana]]_ multiple times.
