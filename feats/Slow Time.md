# Slow Time (Combat)

Meditation allows you to perceive time as if it were moving more slowly.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 15, _[[feats/Combat Meditation|Combat Meditation]]_, _[[feats/Meditation Master|Meditation Master]]_, character level 7th.

**Benefit:** Once per day, when you meditate as a full-round action using the _Combat Meditation_ feat, you gain the effects of _[[spells/Haste|haste]]_ for 1 round per 2 character levels. These effects do not stack with the _haste_ spell, the speed _[[spells/Magic Weapon|magic weapon]]_ special ability, or other effects granting the same result. This is an extraordinary ability.
