# Shield Proficiency (Combat)

You are trained in how to properly use a _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_.

**Benefit:** When you use a _shield_ (except a _[[items/Shield/Tower shield|tower shield]]_), the _shield_'s armor check penalty only applies to Strength- and Dexterity-based skills.

**Normal:** When you are using a _shield_ with which you are not proficient, you take the _shield_'s armor check penalty on attack rolls and on all skill checks that involve moving.

**Special:** Barbarians, bards, clerics, druids, fighters, paladins, and rangers all automatically have _[[feats/Shield Proficiency|Shield Proficiency]]_ as a bonus feat. They need not select it.
