# Friend To Animals

You show great respect for all living things, and they sense and return the gesture.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Nature Soul|Nature Soul]]_, Handle Animal 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** As a standard action you can require all animals within 30 feet to make a Will saving throw. Animals who fail the save cannot attack you unless you attack them or one of their allies first. The DC of the Will save is equal to 10 + half your character level + your Charisma modifier.
