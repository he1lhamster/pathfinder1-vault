# Smashing Crush (Combat)

Your hammers strike objects with destructive force.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Improved Sunder|Improved Sunder]]_, _[[feats/Smashing Style|Smashing Style]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ with the chosen weapon.

**Benefit:** While using _Smashing Style_, if you successfully damage an object with the sunder combat maneuver, you reduce its hardness by 1. An object can't have its hardness reduced to less than 50% of its normal hardness, and its hardness is restored when the damage dealt by the sunder attack is repaired.
