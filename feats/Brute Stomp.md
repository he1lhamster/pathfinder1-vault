# Brute Stomp (Combat)

Few can avoid the brutal violence of your bone-crushing kicks and stomps.

**Prerequisites:** Str 19, Int 13, _[[feats/Brute Style|Brute Style]]_, _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_, _[[feats/Improved Overrun|Improved Overrun]]_, _[[feats/Improved Trip|Improved Trip]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|Vicious]]_ StompUC, base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit:** While using _Brute Style_, when you make a full attack with a _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ opponent adjacent to you that includes at least one unarmed strike, you can make an additional unarmed strike at your highest base attack bonus against that _prone_ creature. These additional attacks don't stack with those granted by _[[feats/Medusa's Wrath|Medusa's Wrath]]_, and this does not allow you to make an additional attack against a creature you tripped during your full attack. Additionally, you can use your _[[feats/Vicious Stomp|Vicious Stomp]]_ feat against any opponent within your natural reach regardless of whether it falls _prone_ adjacent to you.
