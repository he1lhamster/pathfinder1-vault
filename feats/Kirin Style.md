# Kirin Style (Combat, Style)

Your study and your _[[spells/Grace|grace]]_ allows you to exploit your enemies' weaknesses.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, Knowledge (arcana) 6 ranks, Knowledge (dungeoneering, local, nature, planes, or religion) 1 rank.

**Benefit:** While using this style, you can spend a swift action to make a Knowledge check to _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ a single creature (DC 15 + the creature's CR for this purpose). If you succeed at the check, while using this style, you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against that creature's attacks, as well as a +2 _[[feats/Dodge|dodge]]_ bonus to AC against that creature's attacks of opportunity. These bonuses last for as long as you use this style. If you cease combat with the creature during this time and resume it later, you can attempt the check again.
