You gain bonuses on damage when you wield identical one-handed weapons.

**Prerequisites:** Three or more arms, Dex 21

**Benefit:** When you wield one-handed or light weapons in each of your arms, and all of those weapons belong to the same weapon group (as defined for the _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_ class), all attacks with those weapons gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls.
