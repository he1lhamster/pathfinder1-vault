# Verdant Spell (Metamagic)

Your magical connection to nature allows you to entice, fool, and misdirect plants and fungi as though they were people.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Spell Focus|Spell Focus]]_ (enchantment), Knowledge (nature) 6 ranks.

**Benefit:** A _[[feats/Verdant Spell|verdant spell]]_ affects plant creatures (even mindless plant creatures) as if they weren't immune to mind-affecting effects, but has no effect on other types of creatures. A _verdant spell_ uses up a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell's actual level. This feat works only on mind-affecting spells.

**Normal:** Plant creatures are immune to mind-affecting effects.
