# Run

You are swift of foot.

**Benefit:** When running, you move five times your normal speed (if wearing _[[classes/Medium|medium]]_, light, or no armor and carrying no more than a _medium_ load) or four times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load). If you make a _[[spells/Jump|jump]]_ after a running start (see the Acrobatics skill description), you gain a +4 bonus on your Acrobatics check. While running, you retain your Dexterity bonus to your Armor Class.

**Normal:** You move four times your speed while running (if wearing _medium_, light, or no armor and carrying no more than a _medium_ load) or three times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load), and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC.
