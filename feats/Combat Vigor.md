# Combat Vigor (Combat)

You can quickly recuperate from devastating attacks without divine assistance.

**Prerequisites:** Con 13.

**Benefit:** You gain a _[[spells/Vigor|vigor]]_ pool with a maximum number of points equal to your Constitution bonus. As a standard action, you can spend up to 1 _vigor_ point per 3 Hit Dice you have (minimum 1) to regain 1d6 hit points per _vigor_ point spent (maximum 7d6). Each time you spend _vigor_ points, you become _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_ for 1 minute. You cannot spend _vigor_ points while _fatigued_ or _[[conditions/Exhausted|exhausted]]_. Spending _vigor_ points doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. The points in your _vigor_ pool are replenished to their maximum after you rest for 8 hours.
