# Greater Spell Specialization

You can _[[spells/Sacrifice|sacrifice]]_ a prepared spell in order to spontaneously cast your specialized spell.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Spell Focus|Spell Focus]]_, _[[feats/Spell Specialization|Spell Specialization]]_, able to prepare 5th-level spells.

**Benefit:** By sacrificing a prepared spell of the same or higher level than your specialized spell, you may spontaneously cast your specialized spell. The specialized spell is treated as its normal level, regardless of the spell slot used to cast it. You may add a metamagic feat to the spell by increasing the spell slot and casting time, just like a _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ spontaneously casting a cure or inflict spell with a metamagic feat.
