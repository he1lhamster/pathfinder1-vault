# Fleeting Spell (Metamagic)

Your spells _[[spells/Vanish|vanish]]_ with unusual speed.

**Benefit:** A _[[feats/Fleeting Spell|fleeting spell]]_'s duration becomes dismissible, if it is not already. You can dismiss your own _fleeting spell_ as a swift action. When you dismiss a _fleeting spell_, its lingering aura cannot be detected by magic unless the caster succeeds at a caster level check against a DC equal to 11 + your caster level. The DC of dispel checks to counter a _fleeting spell_ is reduced by 2, and once active, _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ removes a _fleeting spell_ without a caster level check. A _fleeting spell_ has half its normal duration (with an extended _fleeting spell_, these duration adjustments cancel out). Only spells with a duration of at least 2 rounds can be made fleeting, and instantaneous or permanent spells cannot be fleeting spells. A _fleeting spell_ does not use up a higher-level spell slot than the spell's actual level.

**Normal:** It is a standard action to dismiss a dismissible spell, and only spells whose Duration entry is marked with a D are dismissible.
