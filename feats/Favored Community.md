# Favored Community

You know your local community like the back of your hand.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (local) 2 ranks, must have lived in the settlement for at least 1 year.

**Benefit:** Select a permanent, stationary settlement. While in that settlement, you gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks, as per the _[[classes/Ranger|ranger]]_'s favored terrain class feature. If you already have that class feature and apply its bonuses in your _[[feats/Favored Community|favored community]]_, increase the bonus provided by favored terrain by 2. The bonuses from this feat do not stack with other effects that provide or augment favored terrain bonuses, such as _[[items/Wondrous Item/Boots of Friendly Terrain|boots of friendly terrain]]_ (Advanced Player's Guide 301).
