# Net Maneuvering (Combat)

With sweeping movements and brute force, you can use your _[[items/Mundane/Net|net]]_ to put foes at a disadvantage.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Exotic Weapon Proficiency|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]]_ (_net_), _[[feats/Net Adept|Net Adept]]_, base attack bonus +3.

**Benefit:** In melee, you can use a _net_ to _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ or disarm opponents instead of entangling them. You gain a +2 bonus on disarm checks made to use a _net_ in this way. Further, if you have an opponent _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_ in your _net_, you can attempt to drag or reposition that opponent as long as he is within your _net_'s reach or you control the trailing rope on your _net_.
