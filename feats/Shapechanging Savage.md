# Shapechanging Savage

You catch foes off _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_ when changing your shape.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Feint|Improved Feint]]_ or canny feint _[[classes/Vigilante|vigilante]]_ talent, _[[universal monster rules/Change Shape|change shape]]_ ability, shapechanger subtype.

**Benefit:** Whenever you use your _change shape_ ability to assume a new form or to return to your _[[spells/True Form|true form]]_, you can attempt a Bluff check as a swift action to feint one opponent within 30 feet who witnessed your _[[spells/Transformation|transformation]]_. You take a -4 penalty on Bluff checks to feint an opponent who is aware that you are a shapechanger. You don't take the usual penalties for feinting a creature of a different type or a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 when feinting in this manner.

**Special:** A character with the wild shape class feature counts as having the _change shape_ ability and shapechanger subtype for the purpose of meeting this feat's prerequisites. A character with wild shape can use this feat's benefit whenever she uses wild shape to assume a new form or return to her _true form_.
