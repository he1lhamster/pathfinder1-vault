# Shaitan Earthblast (Combat)

With a forceful stomp you release a blast of acid from the earth to _[[universal monster rules/Burn|burn]]_ your enemies.

**Prerequisites:** Con 15, Wis 17, _[[feats/Elemental Fist|Elemental Fist]]_**, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Shaitan Skin|Shaitan Skin]]_, _[[feats/Shaitan Style|Shaitan Style]]_, base attack bonus +13 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 11th.

**Benefit:** While using the _Shaitan Style_ feat, as a standard action, you can spend two _Elemental Fist_ (Advanced Player's Guide 158) attempts to unleash a 20-foot column of acid that has a 5-foot radius and erupts from a point of origin within 30 feet of you. Creatures caught in the column take your unarmed strike damage plus the acid damage from your _Elemental Fist_ and are _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1 round. A successful Ref lex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modif ier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from being _staggered_.
