# Trick Spell (Metamagic)

The vengeful nature of your goddess flows through your magic, turning your enemies against themselves.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to cast 1st-level spells, chaotic neutral alignment, worshiper of Calistria.

**Benefit:** Only enchantment spells that affect a single target and can be negated with a successful Will save can be trick spells. If the target fails its Will save against a _[[feats/Trick Spell|trick spell]]_, in addition to the spell's normal effects, the target also clumsily hinders itself. Immediately attempt a special combat maneuver check (1d20 + your caster level + your Charisma bonus) to perform a dirty trick combat maneuver against the target. Any feats you have that apply to dirty trick maneuvers (such as Greater Dirty TrickAPG) also apply to this check. A _trick spell_ takes up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.
