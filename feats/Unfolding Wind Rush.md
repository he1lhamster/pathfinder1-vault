# Unfolding Wind Rush (Combat)

Thrown weapons fly from your hands as if blown by a gale, and you leave behind a wake of wind as you move.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13; Wis 13; _[[feats/Dodge|Dodge]]_; _[[feats/Mobility|Mobility]]_; _[[feats/Perfect Style|Perfect Style]]_; _[[feats/Quick Draw|Quick Draw]]_; _[[feats/Unfolding Wind Strike|Unfolding Wind Strike]]_; base attack bonus +13 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 13th.

**Benefit:** When using _Perfect Style_ and wielding thrown weapons, you can combine a full-attack action with a single move action. You must forgo the attack at your highest bonus but can take the remaining attacks as normal at any point during your movement. You can spend 1 ki point as a swift action to create a path of wind along your path of movement that functions as _[[spells/Wind Wall|wind wall]]_ for 1 round; this effect does not affect your ranged attacks.
