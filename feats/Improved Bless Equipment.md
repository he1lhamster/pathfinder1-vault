# Improved Bless Equipment

You can channel even more energy into weapons and armor to grant them several divine powers at once.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Bless Equipment|Bless Equipment]]_, caster level 9th, channel energy class feature.

**Benefit:** The number of uses of channeled energy you must _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ to _[[spells/Bless|bless]]_ a piece of equipment using _Bless Equipment_ and _[[feats/Align Equipment|Align Equipment]]_ decreases by one (to a minimum of one use of channel energy per blessing). You can also _bless_ a piece of equipment with up to two blessings at a time. Each blessing provides a different special ability drawn from the _Bless Equipment_ list (and the _Align Equipment_ list if you possess that feat). You must still have a high enough caster level to _bless_ a piece of equipment with each of the selected blessings. You _expend_ the appropriate number of uses of channeled energy required for each blessing, taking into account the reduction granted by this feat (and the increase for blessing a masterwork item, if needed). For example, a _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ with this feat would need to _expend_ two uses of channeled energy to _bless_ a weapon with the undead-bane and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]]_ special abilities (one use for _[[spells/Bane|bane]]_ plus one use for _ghost touch_). If a given piece of equipment already has a blessing on it, you can give it a second blessing. When another blessing is applied to a piece of equipment that currently has a blessing active on it, the durations for the two blessings are tracked separately.
