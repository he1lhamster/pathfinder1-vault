# Endurance

Harsh conditions or long exertions do not easily tire you.

**Benefit:** You gain a +4 bonus on the following checks and saves: Swim checks made to resist nonlethal damage from exhaustion; Constitution checks made to continue running; Constitution checks made to avoid nonlethal damage from a forced march; Constitution checks made to hold your breath; Constitution checks made to avoid nonlethal damage from starvation or thirst; Fortitude saves made to avoid nonlethal damage from hot or cold environments; and Fortitude saves made to resist damage from _[[spells/Suffocation|suffocation]]_. You may sleep in light or _[[classes/Medium|medium]]_ armor without becoming _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_.

**Normal:** A character without this feat who sleeps in _medium_ or heavier armor is _fatigued_ the next day.
