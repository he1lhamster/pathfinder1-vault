# Trade Initiative (Teamwork)

You're an expert at helping your partner respond faster, and vice versa.

**Benefit:** After initiative is rolled but before enemies' initiative is revealed, you may trade the results of your die roll (not including modifiers) with an adjacent ally who also possesses this feat.
