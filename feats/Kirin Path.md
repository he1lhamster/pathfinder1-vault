# Kirin Path (Combat)

You turn knowledge of your enemy into a flawless defense.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Kirin Strike|Kirin Strike]]_, _[[feats/Kirin Style|Kirin Style]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, Knowledge (arcana) 12 ranks, Knowledge (dungeoneering, local, nature, planes, or religion) 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** Whenever you make a Knowledge check to _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ a creature, even when using _Kirin Style_, you can take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent you from doing so. While using _Kirin Style_ against a creature you have identified using that feat, if the creature ends its turn within your threatened area, you can spend a use of your attacks of opportunity that round to move up to 5 feet times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). You must end your move in a square threatened by the creature. This move does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
