# Bouncing Trick (Trick)

Your _[[classes/Mesmerist|mesmerist]]_ trick jumps to a new target after the trick is triggered.

**Prerequisites:** _Mesmerist_ trick class feature.

**Benefit:** Whenever you implant a _mesmerist_ trick in a target's mind, you can spend any number of additional uses of your _mesmerist_ trick ability to transform the trick into a _[[feats/Bouncing Trick|bouncing trick]]_. The maximum number of uses of the _mesmerist_ trick ability that you can spend on a single _bouncing trick_ is equal to your Charisma modifier. After you trigger a _bouncing trick_, you can redirect the trick to one target within 30 feet as an immediate action. The redirected trick is immediately implanted in the new target's mind, as if it were the original target. You can't implant a _bouncing trick_ in a target that has been previously implanted with that same _bouncing trick_. You can't implant a creature with a _bouncing trick_ in this manner if doing so would place it above the maximum number of _mesmerist_ tricks that you can implant in a single target. You can redirect the trick multiple times, up to the number of additional uses of the _mesmerist_ trick ability that you spent on the _bouncing trick_. If you don't use an immediate action to redirect a _bouncing trick_ as soon as the trick is triggered, any remaining uses of the _mesmerist_ trick ability that you invested in the _bouncing trick_ are lost.
