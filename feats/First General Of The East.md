# First General Of The East

Your creator was a soldier and person of war, and your memories are filled with the taste of blood.

**Prerequisites:** Character level 5th, _[[monsters/Shabti|shabti]]_.

**Benefit:** Once per day, you can cast greater _[[spells/Magic Weapon|magic weapon]]_ as a spell-like ability. You gain a second daily use at 9th level, and a third at 15th level. Only you can benefit from this spell-like ability; anyone else who wields the enchanted weapon gains no benefit from the spell. The caster level for this ability is equal to your character level.
