# Channel Hate

You masterfully inspire in others violence toward those you hate.

**Prerequisites:** Channel energy 6d6, worshiper of Gyronna.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ one use of your channel energy ability to affect a single creature within 30 feet as if you had cast vengeful outrageUM (caster level equal to your effective _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ level). Upon obtaining channel energy 9d6, you can affect a number of creatures within 30 feet equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 2 creatures) with this feat instead. If you _expend_ an extra use of channel energy when using this feat, the target does not gain a second saving throw against this effect if you designate the target's friend or loved one as its hated enemy.
