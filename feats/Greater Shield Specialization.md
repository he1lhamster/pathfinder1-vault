# Greater Shield Specialization (Combat)

Your masterful shieldwork provides even greater protection to your vital areas.

**Prerequisites:** Proficiency with selected _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_, _[[feats/Greater _Shield_ Focus|Greater _Shield_ Focus]]_, _[[feats/Shield Focus|Shield Focus]]_, _[[feats/Shield Specialization|Shield Specialization]]_ with selected _shield_, _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_ level 12th.

**Benefit:** Choose one type of _shield_ (_[[items/Armor/Buckler|buckler]]_, light, heavy, or _[[items/Shield/Tower shield|tower shield]]_) for which you possess the _Shield Specialization_ feat. With the selected _shield_, you gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class against critical hit confirmation rolls (this bonus stacks with that from _Shield Specialization_). In addition, once per day you may negate a critical hit, and damage is instead rolled normally.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of _shield_.
