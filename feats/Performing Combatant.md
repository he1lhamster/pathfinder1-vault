# Performing Combatant (Combat)

You treat every combat as a performance, bringing _[[spells/Flare|flare]]_ and showmanship.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Dazzling Display|Dazzling Display]]_, any one performance feat.

**Benefit:** You can make performance combat checks in any combat. When making a performance check outside of performance combat, you can pick a single performance feat to use. You automatically gain any bonus on the performance combat check the feat grants, and then you make a DC 20 performance combat check. On a success, you gain the full effect of the performance feat you chose.
