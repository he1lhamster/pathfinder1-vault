# Illusive Gnome Style (Combat, Style)

The chaotic, somewhat random design of your racial weapons makes it easy to combine them with illusions.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, Gnome Weapon FocusARG, _[[feats/Improved Feint|Improved Feint]]_, base attack bonus +1, gnome magic and weapon familiarity racial traits.

**Benefit:** While feinting with a melee weapon that has "gnome" in its name, you can _[[spells/Sacrifice|sacrifice]]_ a spell slot, a spell of the illusion school, or a spell from the gnome magic racial trait to gain a bonus on the skill check attempted to feint. This bonus is equal to 1 + the level of the spell sacrificed. If you _sacrifice_ a 0-level spell, you cannot cast or _sacrifice_ that spell again for 24 hours.
