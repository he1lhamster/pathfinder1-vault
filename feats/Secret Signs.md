# Secret Signs

You are particularly adept at communicating with others via innuendo, gestures, and secret hand signs.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13.

**Benefit:** You gain a +4 bonus on Bluff checks made to pass secret messages. In addition, you are adept at hiding the somatic components of spellcasting. If you cast a spell that has only somatic components, an observer must make a Perception check opposed by your Sleight of Hand check to notice your spellcasting. Spellcraft checks made to _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ any spell you cast that has somatic components take a -2 penalty.
