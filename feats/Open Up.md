# Open Up (Combat, Teamwork)

You _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ an opponent's _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_, opening your foe up to an unobstructed attack by an ally.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_.

**Benefit:** When you successfully use the aid another action to improve the next attack roll against an opponent by an ally who also has this feat, that attack also ignores any Armor Class bonus granted by the opponent's _shield_. This benefit affects only physical shields, not _shield_ bonuses from spells or other sources.

**Special:** If both you and your ally also have the _[[feats/Harrying Partners|Harrying Partners]]_ teamwork feat, all of your ally's attacks made before your next turn ignore the opponent's Armor Class bonus from a _shield_.
