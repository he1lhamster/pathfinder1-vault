# Implant Bomb

You can _[[universal monster rules/Attach|attach]]_ a bomb to a creature that explodes when the creature dies or after 24 hours.

**Prerequisites:** _[[spells/Heal|Heal]]_ 5 ranks, delayed bomb _[[classes/Alchemist|alchemist]]_ discovery.

**Benefit:** You may implant a bomb in a willing or _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ creature (a mindless creature under your control, such as a zombie, counts as willing for this purpose). This takes 1 hour and expends 1 use of your bomb ability for the day. When the implanted creature dies or is destroyed, the bomb detonates in the creature's square as if it were a delayed bomb set by you (though you can set the bomb's damage to less than your normal bomb damage). You can use any bomb-affecting discoveries on this implanted bomb (acid bomb, frost bomb, _[[items/Mundane/Smoke Bomb|smoke bomb]]_, and so on) as normal. The bomb automatically detonates 24 hours after you implant it in the creature. If you _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ 150 gp worth of alchemical reagents per die of the bomb's damage (for example, 750 gp for a 5d6 bomb), the bomb does not automatically _[[spells/Detonate|detonate]]_ after 24 hours, and only detonates if the creature dies or is destroyed (24 hours after implantation, this bomb no longer counts toward your daily total). Implanting a bomb is as invasive as using the _Heal_ skill to treat _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ wounds and leaves surgical scars unless the creature is healed by magic or abilities such as _[[universal monster rules/Regeneration|regeneration]]_ or _[[universal monster rules/Fast Healing|fast healing]]_. Some creatures (such as oozes, elementals, and creatures with the _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ quality) cannot have bombs implanted in them. Removing an implanted bomb requires a _Heal_ check to treat _deadly_ wounds, followed by a _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ spell or Disable Device check to neutralize the bomb (DC = 11 + _alchemist_'s caster level).
