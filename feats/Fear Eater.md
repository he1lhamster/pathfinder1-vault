# Fear Eater

You eat the _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ of others, freeing them from its effects.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, _[[feats/Iron Will|Iron Will]]_, have no _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to _fear_ effects.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can remove a _fear_ effect from another creature by touching it. The _fear_ effect is transferred from that creature to you, with the same remaining duration. If the _fear_ effect has varying effects depending on the target (such as the effects of _[[spells/Cause Fear|cause fear]]_ depending on the target's Hit Dice), it has the effect it had on the original creature or the effect it would have on you, whichever is more severe. When you choose to accept another creature's _fear_, you don't receive any saving throw, _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_, or other defenses you would normally have against the _fear_ effect.
