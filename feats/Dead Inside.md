# Dead Inside (Story)

You are devoid of both hatred and joy. While many regard you as callous, you have no particular malice in your heart.

**Prerequisites:** You must have failed your saving throws against at least five different emotion-manipulating spells or your saving throw against a supernatural creature's _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effect (such as a dragon's _[[universal monster rules/Frightful Presence|frightful presence]]_), or you have the Sunless or Sole _[[feats/Survivor|Survivor]]_ background.

**Benefit:** When you are the target of a spell or spell-like ability with the emotionUM or _fear_ descriptor, you can roll your saving throw twice and take the better result.

**Goal:** You overcome your detached state by taking part in an important emotional event, such as finding _[[feats/True Love|true love]]_ or taking great pleasure in an act of unrepentant evil. Alternatively, you divest yourself of all emotion by severing your remaining emotional ties and eventually changing your alignment to neutral.

**Completion Benefit:** You master your emotions. You can ignore any morale bonuses or penalties applied to you by outside forces, though other emotion-based effects (such as the _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ condition or an _[[items/Wondrous Item/Elixir of Love|elixir of love]]_) still affect you if you fail a saving throw against them.
