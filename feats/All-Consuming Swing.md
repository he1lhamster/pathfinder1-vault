# All-Consuming Swing (Combat)

You deliver unchecked _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ when you stand against multiple foes, sometimes to your own detriment.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, _[[feats/Cleave|Cleave]]_, _[[feats/Vital Strike|Vital Strike]]_, base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit:** Whenever you use _Cleave_ or _[[feats/Great Cleave|Great Cleave]]_, you can apply the additional damage you would gain from _Vital Strike_, _[[feats/Improved Vital Strike|Improved Vital Strike]]_, or _[[feats/Greater Vital Strike|Greater Vital Strike]]_ to the initial target of your attack. When you do so, the strain on your body causes you to take an amount of damage equal to the extra damage dealt by your _Vital Strike_ feat. This self-inflicted damage is not reduced by _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_.
