# Greater Elemental Focus

Choose an energy type to which you have already applied the _[[feats/Elemental Focus|Elemental Focus]]_ feat. Any spells you cast of this energy type are very hard to resist.

**Prerequisites:** _Elemental Focus_.

**Benefit:** Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against spells that deal damage of the energy type you select. This bonus stacks with the bonus from _Elemental Focus_.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take this feat, it applies to a new energy type to which you have already applied the _Elemental Focus_ feat.
