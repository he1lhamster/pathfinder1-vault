# Shadow Gambit

You can tap into the Plane of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|Shadow]]_ to momentarily lend reality to one of your illusion (figment) spells.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Spell Focus|Spell Focus]]_ (illusion), caster level 5th.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can draw upon energies from the Plane of _Shadow_ to cause an ongoing figment spell you cast to damage a foe as if the illusion were real. The illusion must be one you retain ongoing control of, such as _[[spells/Minor Image|minor image]]_, and the target must be both visible to you and within or adjacent to the area of your illusion. Using this feat immediately ends the figment's duration. You must either make a melee touch attack or give the target a saving throw (Fortitude or Reflex) to resist the damage (see below). If you choose a melee touch attack, you use your own melee touch attack bonus, and if you miss, the spell deals no damage. If you choose to allow the target a saving throw, a successful save means it takes half damage. The shadowy attack deals 1d6 points of damage per spell level. If the target disbelieves or sees through the illusion, reduce the damage by half. The shadowy attack can deal acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, or slashing damage, but the damage must be appropriate to the illusion. For example, an _[[spells/Illusory Wall|illusory wall]]_ that collapses deals bludgeoning damage with a Fortitude save for half, an illusory swordsman strikes with a melee touch attack deals slashing damage, and an _illusory wall_ of fire deals fire damage with a Reflex save for half.
