# Planar Focus

By studying other planes, you've learned to take on aspects of outsiders as well as animals.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (planes) 5 ranks, animal focusACG class feature.

**Benefit:** When you use your animal focus class feature, you can choose any of the following new aspects unless they conflict with your alignment. 
Air: You gain a constant _[[spells/Feather Fall|feather fall]]_ effect. At 10th level, you instead gain a constant _[[spells/Levitate|levitate]]_ effect.
