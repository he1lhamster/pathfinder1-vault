# Spirit's Gift

You _[[spells/Commune|commune]]_ with a spirit of your choice, and it grants your animal companion or familiar a boon.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to acquire an animal companion or a familiar.

**Benefit:** At the start of each day, you can _commune_ with a single _[[classes/Shaman|shaman]]_ spirit. (Although a _shaman_ would need an hour of preparation, this action takes you no time.) Once during the next 24 hours, you can spend a standard action to grant your animal companion or familiar that _shaman_ spirit's spirit animal ability for 1 minute per level in the class that grants your animal companion or familiar.
