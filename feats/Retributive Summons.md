# Retributive Summons

Your _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ in counterspelling summons is so extensive that you can redirect some of your foes' power to call forth your own allies.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Spell Focus|Spell Focus]]_ (conjuration) or counter-summons class feature (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Paths of Prestige 46).

**Benefit:** When you successfully counter a summoning spell with _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ or your own _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ monster spell, you can immediately _summon_ nonevil creatures as if you had just finished casting a _summon_ monster spell of 2 levels lower than the countered summoning spell.
