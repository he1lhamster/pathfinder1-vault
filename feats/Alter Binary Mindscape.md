# Alter Binary Mindscape

You can shift and change a binary mindscape to your advantage during a _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ duel.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, ability to cast _[[spells/Instigate _Psychic_ Duel|instigate _psychic_ duel]]_.

**Benefit:** When you cast _instigate _psychic_ duel_ and create a binary mindscape (see page 235), the arena you create puts your enemy at a disadvantage. Your opponent must spend 1 more manifestation point than normal when creating any defensive manifestations.
