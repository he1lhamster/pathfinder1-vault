# Blinding Light

You use your impenetrable luminescence to disorient harbingers of _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Inner Light|Inner Light]]_, _[[monsters/Aasimar|aasimar]]_, _[[spells/Daylight|daylight]]_ spell-like ability.

**Benefit:** Whenever an enemy unsuccessfully attempts to counter or dispel your _daylight_ spell-like ability, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier) or become _[[conditions/Blinded|blinded]]_ for 1 round as its mind is overwhelmed with celestial light. This is a supernatural mind-affecting effect.
