# Brute Assault (Combat)

With brute force, you can bowl over and cripple opponents by treading on them.

**Prerequisites:** Str 23, Int 13, _[[feats/Brute Stomp|Brute Stomp]]_, _[[feats/Brute Style|Brute Style]]_, _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_, _[[feats/Improved Overrun|Improved Overrun]]_, _[[feats/Improved Trip|Improved Trip]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|Vicious]]_ StompUC, base attack bonus +10.

**Benefit:** While using _Brute Style_, when you successfully perform an overrun or _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ combat maneuver against an opponent that causes that opponent to fall _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_, your opponent takes 1d6 points of Strength damage, and its base speed is halved until the Strength damage is healed. A successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus) reduces the Strength damage to 1 point and negates the movement speed reduction.
