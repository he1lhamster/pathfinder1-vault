# Rending Fury (Combat)

You easily tear your enemies limb from limb with your _[[universal monster rules/Natural Attacks|natural attacks]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +6, _[[universal monster rules/Rend|rend]]_ special attack.

**Benefit:** You deal _rend_ damage if you hit with half the normal _natural attacks_ your _rend_ requires. For example, a _[[monsters/Troll|troll]]_ that has this feat can _rend_ when it hits with one claw attack, while a _[[monsters/Girallon|girallon]]_ that has this feat must hit one target with two claw attacks to _rend_. You can only make this _rend_ attack once per round.
