# Psychic Combatant (Combat)

You are skilled at attacking opponents in _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ duels.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Psychic Sensitivity|Psychic Sensitivity]]_ or the ability to cast _psychic_ spells or use _psychic_ _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_, character level 3rd.

**Benefit:** You gain an extra pool of manifestation points with a number of points equal to 1/2 your character level. You can use these points at any time during a _psychic_ duel. When you are not participating in a _psychic_ duel, you can spend 1 of these extra manifestation points as a swift action to gain a +1 bonus on saving throws against _psychic_ spells until the start of your next turn, or 3 points as a swift action to gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against _psychic_ spells until the start of your next turn. This pool refreshes at the start of each day.
