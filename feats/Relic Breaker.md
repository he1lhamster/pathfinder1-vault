# Relic Breaker (Combat)

You are _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Furious|furious]]_ when destroying dangerous objects.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Gate Breaker|Gate Breaker]]_, _[[feats/Improved Sunder|Improved Sunder]]_, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** Whenever you sunder a held object, its bearer must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or the bearer catches on fire (taking 1d6 points of fire damage immediately, and an additional 1d6 points of fire damage each subsequent round the creature fails a Reflex saving throw). When your total Hit Dice reach 5, this damage increases by 1d6, and it increases by 1d6 every 5 levels thereafter, to a maximum of 5d6 at 20th level. The saving throw's DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Charisma modifier.
