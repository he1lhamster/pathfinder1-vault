# Cleave Through (Combat)

You are ferocious at hewing smaller opponents.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Cleave|Cleave]]_, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, base attack bonus +11, dwarf.

**Benefit:** When using _Cleave_ or _[[feats/Great Cleave|Great Cleave]]_, if your initial attack hits, you may take a single 5-foot step as a free action before making your additional attacks. If doing so places a creature within your threatened area, that creature becomes a legal target for your additional _Cleave_ attack(s) as long as it meets all the other prerequisites.

**Normal:** You may only make additional attacks with _Cleave_ against creatures you threaten when you make your initial attack.
