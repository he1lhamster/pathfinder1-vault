# Just Out Of Reach (Combat)

The farther an attacker is from you, the more easily you avoid its melee attacks.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Dodge|Dodge]]_, _[[feats/Mobility|Mobility]]_.

**Benefit:** When a foe more than 5 feet away from you makes a melee attack against you using reach, you gain a +4 _dodge_ bonus to your AC against the attack.
