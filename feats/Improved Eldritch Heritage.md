# Improved Eldritch Heritage

The power of your discovered bloodline continues to grow.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 15, _[[feats/Eldritch Heritage|Eldritch Heritage]]_, character level 11th.

**Benefit:** You gain either the 3rd-level or the 9th-level power (your choice) of the bloodline you selected with the _Eldritch Heritage_ feat. For purposes of using that power, treat your _[[classes/Sorcerer|sorcerer]]_ level as equal to your character level - 2, even if you have levels in _sorcerer_. You do not gain any of the other bloodline abilities.

**Special:** You may select this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you select the feat, it applies to a different bloodline power for that bloodline available at _sorcerer_ level 3 or 9.
