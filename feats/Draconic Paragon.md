# Draconic Paragon

You can shrug off sleep and _[[universal monster rules/Paralysis|paralysis]]_ effects as well as any dragon, and your draconic aspects improve.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Draconic Aspect|Draconic Aspect]]_, _[[feats/Draconic Breath|Draconic Breath]]_, _[[feats/Draconic Glide|Draconic Glide]]_, character level 10th, _[[monsters/Kobold|kobold]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus against sleep and _paralysis_ effects. You can use your _[[universal monster rules/Breath Weapon|breath weapon]]_ twice per day and your _breath weapon_ damage increases to 4d6 points of energy damage. Your wings from the _Draconic Glide_ feat grow stronger, granting you a fly speed of 20 feet (average maneuverability).
