# Rouse Emotions

You can sway the hearts of an entire crowd with your art, or turn them against your enemies.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, _[[feats/Charming Performance|Charming Performance]]_, Perform (any) 5 ranks, bardic performance or raging song.

**Benefit:** You can use _Charming Performance_ on all creatures within 60 feet. In addition to swaying the crowd's starting attitude toward a single person, you may choose to sway the crowd's attitude toward a well-defined group with which they are familiar (such as a specific nation, organization, or religion). An attempt to _[[feats/Rouse Emotions|rouse emotions]]_ about a group takes a -5 penalty due to the difficulty of creating strong feelings toward an entire group rather than a specific individual. The DC for this check is 30 + 1 for every five people in the crowd to be affected. You can't use _Rouse Emotions_ to change a crowd's attitude by more than one step, or to make it helpful or hostile.
