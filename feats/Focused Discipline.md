# Focused Discipline (Combat)

Familiarity with the military traditions of your homeland inspires uncommon valor in you.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on all saving throws against _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effects. Whenever a _fear_ effect targets you and fails to affect you (either because of a successful saving throw or because of _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to _fear_), you gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and CMB checks against the creature that attempted to use the _fear_ affect on you for 1 round.
