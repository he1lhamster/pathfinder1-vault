# Lighting The Way (Story)

You seek to lead others through your pious example.

**Prerequisites:** Be a member of House Zespire, or have the Devoted, Exemplar, Marked by the Gods, or _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Righteous|Righteous]]_ Mentor background.

**Benefit:** Once per day as a standard action, you can give all allies within 30 feet who can hear you a +1 bonus on attack rolls and on saving throws against mind-affecting effects for 1 minute.

**Goal:** Establish your religion in an existing settlement where it isn't present. You can do this by having a settlement gain the Holy Site or Pious quality for devotion to your deity (Gamemastery Guide 207), or change its government to a theocracy based on your religion.

**Completion Benefit:** You can spontaneously convert any 2nd-level or higher divine spell into _[[spells/Enthrall|enthrall]]_ and can spontaneously convert any 3rd-level or higher divine spell into _[[spells/Suggestion|suggestion]]_.
