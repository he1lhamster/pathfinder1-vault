# Hurtful (Combat)

You know how to add injury to insult.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_.

**Benefit:** When you successfully demoralize an opponent within your melee reach with an Intimidate check, you can make a single melee attack against that creature as a swift action. If your attack fails to damage the target, its _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ condition from being demoralized immediately ends.
