# Improved Gaseous Form

Your gaseous state is more _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ than that of your peers.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Vampire|Vampire]]_.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can assume _[[spells/Gaseous Form|gaseous form]]_ at will (caster level 5th), but can remain gaseous indefinitely and have a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. This is a supernatural ability. If you already possess the _gaseous form_ special quality, you can instead choose to augment your _gaseous form_ in one of the following ways. These effects apply only to creatures that enter your space while you are in _gaseous form_. _[[spells/Glitterdust|Glitterdust]]_ (Su): Creatures must succeed at a Will save or be _[[conditions/Blinded|blinded]]_ and outlined in golden particles as though under the effects of _glitterdust_. _[[spells/Mind Fog|Mind Fog]]_ (Su): Creatures must succeed at a Will save or take penalties as though under the effects of _mind fog_. This effect lasts as long as a creature shares your space and for 2d6 rounds after.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take this feat, choose another swarm type.
