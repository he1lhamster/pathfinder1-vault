# Furious Finish

You channel all of your _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ into one massive blow to crush your enemy.

**Prerequisites:** _Rage_ class feature, _[[feats/Vital Strike|Vital Strike]]_, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** While raging, when you use the _Vital Strike_ feat, you can choose not to roll your damage dice and instead deal damage equal to the maximum roll possible on those damage dice. If you do, your _rage_ immediately ends, and you are _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_ (even if you would not normally be).
