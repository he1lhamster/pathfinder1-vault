# Cry Challenge

With a ferocious _[[spells/Shout|shout]]_ or vigorous gestures, you provoke an opponent's ire. By tricking the opponent into making a clumsy swing at you, you provide an opening for your allies.

**Prerequisites:** AntagonizeUM.

**Benefit:** When you take a 5-foot step, you can choose for that step to provoke attacks of opportunity from all opponents that threaten you after the step. You gain a +4 _[[feats/Dodge|dodge]]_ bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity provoked in this manner.

**Normal:** A 5-foot step doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.
