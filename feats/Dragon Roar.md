# Dragon Roar (Combat)

The spirit of the dragon wells up inside you and bursts forth in a mighty roar.

**Prerequisites:** Str 15, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Dragon Style|Dragon Style]]_, _[[feats/Stunning Fist|Stunning Fist]]_, Acrobatics 8 ranks.

**Benefit:** You gain one additional _Stunning Fist_ attempt per day. While using _Dragon Style_, as a standard action you can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ two _Stunning Fist_ attempts to unleash a concussive roar in a 15-foot cone. Creatures caught in the cone take your unarmed strike damage and become _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from being _shaken_.

**Special:** If you have the _[[feats/Elemental Fist|Elemental Fist]]_ feat (Advanced Player's Guide 158), you can _expend_ a daily use of that feat to deal your _Elemental Fist_ damage to those caught in the cone. This damage is not halved even on a save.
