# Bred Commander

You possess a long pedigree of ruthless generals and military tacticians, and an army under your command is more difficult to rout as a result.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Hobgoblin|Hobgoblin]]_.

**Benefit:** When serving as a commander using the mass combat rules presented in Chapter 4 of Ultimate Campaign, you can add your class level to your army's Morale checks in place of your Charisma modifier.
