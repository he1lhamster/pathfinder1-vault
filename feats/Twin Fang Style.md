# Twin Fang Style (Combat, Style)

Your paired blades _[[universal monster rules/Rend|rend]]_ through armor.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15, _[[feats/Quick Draw|Quick Draw]]_, _[[feats/Two-Weapon Fighting|Two-Weapon Fighting]]_, base attack bonus +1, Acrobatics 1 rank.

**Benefit:** Each time you make a full attack wielding a pair of daggers or a pair of _[[items/Weapon/Kama|kama]]_ and hit a creature with both weapons, you reduce its armor bonus to AC by 1 until the beginning of your next turn. This reduction stacks to a minimum armor bonus of +0. For example, if you hit a creature wearing a _[[items/Armor/Chain shirt|chain shirt]]_ with two primary attacks and two off-hand attacks, you would reduce its armor bonus to AC from +4 to +2.
