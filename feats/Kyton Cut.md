# Kyton Cut (Combat)

You lash yourself and share the pain with your opponent.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 17, _[[feats/Exotic Weapon Proficiency|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]]_ (_[[items/Weapon/Spiked chain|spiked chain]]_), _[[feats/Kyton Shield|Kyton Shield]]_, _[[feats/Kyton Style|Kyton Style]]_, base attack bonus +8 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 6th, Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks, ki pool class feature.

**Benefit:** When using _Kyton Style_, your _spiked chain_ attacks can be brutal, both to yourself and your foe. Before attempting an attack roll with a _spiked chain_ attack, you can choose to make a _[[feats/Kyton Cut|Kyton Cut]]_. Before making the attack, you take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. This damage cannot be avoided or reduced in any way. If you are immune to nonlethal damage, you take normal damage instead. If the attack hits, its target takes an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and a -4 penalty on concentration checks for 1 round. The penalty is a painUM effect.
