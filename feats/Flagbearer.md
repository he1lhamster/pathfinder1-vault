# Flagbearer (Combat)

When brandishing a _[[items/Mundane/Flag|flag]]_ adorned with the standard of an organization you owe allegiance to, you inspire nearby members of the same allegiance.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 15.

**Benefit:** As long as you hold your clan, house, or party's f lag (see page 293), members of that allegiance within 30 feet who can see the _flag_ (including yourself ) gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saving throws against _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ and charm effects. You must hold the _flag_ in one hand in order to grant this bonus. If the standard is taken by the enemy or destroyed, this bonus becomes a penalty, affecting all creatures that the bonus previously affected for 1 hour (or until you reclaim the lost _flag_).
