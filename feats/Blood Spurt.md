# Blood Spurt (Combat)

When cut in combat, you spray your blood into the faces of your foes.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +2, susceptibility to _[[universal monster rules/Bleed|bleed]]_ damage.

**Benefit:** Whenever a creature adjacent to you hits you with a melee attack that deals _bleed_ damage, that creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Constitution modifier) or become _[[conditions/Blinded|blinded]]_ for 1d4 rounds as your blood sprays it in the face. Additionally, if you have a special ability that deals _bleed_ damage (such as a _[[classes/Rogue|rogue]]_'s _[[spells/Bleeding Strike|bleeding strike]]_ _rogue_ talent), as a standard action, you can deal 1 point of _bleed_ damage to yourself to spray blood in the face of an adjacent creature of your choice, causing the same effect. The creature only needs to attempt the saving throw for the first of its attacks that deals _bleed_ damage.
