# Warleader's Rage

Your rages are so inspiring to your allies that they don't have to remain adjacent to you to stay raging.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, half-orc or _[[monsters/Orc|orc]]_, non-lawful.

**Benefit:** Feats and abilities that allow an ally to _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ or enhance a _rage_ if adjacent to you (such as _[[feats/Amplified Rage|Amplified Rage]]_ and _[[feats/Sympathetic Rage|Sympathetic Rage]]_) persist as long as your ally is within 30 feet of you and can see you. The conditions to activate the _rage_ effect remain unchanged. For example, an ally with _Sympathetic Rage_ must be adjacent to you to enter his own _rage_, but once his _rage_ begins, he can continue raging as long as he can see you and you are within 30 feet.
