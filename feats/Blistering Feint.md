# Blistering Feint (Combat)

Your foes flinch from the _[[universal monster rules/Heat|heat]]_ of your weapon, giving you an opportunity to slip past their defenses.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Improved Feint|Improved Feint]]_, _[[monsters/Ifrit|ifrit]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on feint checks made while wielding a weapon that deals fire damage. Anytime you successfully feint a creature while using such a weapon, you may deal its fire damage to the enemy.
