# Destructive Persuasion (Combat)

Sometimes, you have to break things if you want people to get your point.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, Intimidate 1 rank.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can attempt to _[[feats/Smash|smash]]_ an unattended inanimate object while attempting an Intimidate check (see _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Smashing|Smashing]]_ an Object, Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 173). If you break the object, you gain a bonus to the Intimidate check equal to half its hardness (minimum +1). If you destroy the object, the bonus is equal to its hardness (minimum +1). Creatures intimidated by this feat cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.
