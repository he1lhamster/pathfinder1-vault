# Cavalry Formation (Combat, Teamwork)

You are skilled at riding in close formation with your mounted allies without impeding your effectiveness on the battlefield.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Mounted Combat|Mounted Combat]]_.

**Benefit:** You and your _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_ can overlap the space of mounts whose riders have this feat, although no more than two creatures can share any one square. Further, you can _[[feats/Charge Through|charge through]]_ a space containing an allied _mount_ if that _mount_'s rider has this feat, although the space from which you make your charge attack must comply with this feat's other benefit or be unoccupied.
