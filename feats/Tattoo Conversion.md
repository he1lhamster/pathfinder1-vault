# Tattoo Conversion

Your have turned your deep knowledge of creating tattoos from summoned creatures into an offensive weapon.

**Prerequisites:** Inscribe Magical TattooISM or Varisian TattooISWG; _[[feats/Tattoo Attunement|Tattoo Attunement]]_; Spellcraft 15 ranks; ability to cast control summoned creatureUM.

**Benefit:** Once per day as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can make a melee touch attack against a summoned creature to transform it into a magical _[[items/Mundane/Tattoo|tattoo]]_ on your body as per _Tattoo Attunement_. When you later transform the creature from _tattoo_ to creature form, you can attempt an opposed Spellcraft check against the creature's original _[[classes/Summoner|summoner]]_; if that _summoner_ is _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_ or dead, you automatically succeed at the check. If you succeed, the creature must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + your caster level) or treat you as the caster of the spell that originally summoned it for the remaining duration of the spell. This is a supernatural ability.
