# Extra Variance

You can augment your channeled energy in new ways.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Channeling Variance|Channeling Variance]]_ or variant _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Channeling|channeling]]_ ability, channel energy class feature.

**Benefit:** You gain one additional variant _channeling_ ability that matches one of your deity's domains, subdomains, or areas of concern. Three times per day, you can apply the modifications of this variant channel energy, reducing the damage dealt or healing performed by your channeled energy as normal. You cannot apply more than one variant _channeling_ ability to your channeled energy at once.

**Special:** You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you gain another variant _channeling_ ability. If you have chosen _Channeling Variance_ twice, you can use any variant _channeling_ ability chosen with this feat whenever you channel energy.
