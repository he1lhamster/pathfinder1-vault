# Squirming Pile (Combat, Teamwork)

Your body is easily lost in the muddy chaos of fighting as a swarm, making your vital areas difficult to target.

**Prerequisites:** Acrobatics 5 ranks, swarming racial trait.

**Benefit:** While sharing a square with an ally who has this feat, you gain a 25% chance of _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Negating|negating]]_ the additional damage from a successful critical hit or sneak attack; if you negate the damage, it is instead rolled normally. This negation chance doesn't stack with similar protection provided by any other source, such as the _[[universal monster rules/Fortification|fortification]]_ armor special ability.
