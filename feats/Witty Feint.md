# Witty Feint (Combat)

Your blending of conversation and martial prowess makes it difficult for opponents to slip past your _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Bluff 1 rank, weapon _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ class feature, gnome.

**Benefit:** When you successfully feint against an opponent in combat, instead of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Denying|denying]]_ the opponent his Dexterity bonus, you may gain a _[[feats/Dodge|dodge]]_ bonus to your AC against his attacks. This bonus is equal to your weapon _training_ bonus for your current weapon. The bonus lasts until combat ends, you switch opponents, or you switch to a different weapon, whichever comes first.
