# Staggering Fist (Combat)

When you engage in unarmed combat, you know just where to strike to stagger your foe.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, Wis 13, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +2.

**Benefit:** When you damage a foe with your unarmed attack, you can also cause it to be _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1 round (until just before your next turn). The target can avoid this with a successful Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier). You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll; thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt. You can attempt to use this feat once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but no more than once per round. Constructs, _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ creatures, plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected by this ability.
