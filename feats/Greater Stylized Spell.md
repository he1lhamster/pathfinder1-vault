# Greater Stylized Spell

You can modify your spell's superficial qualities in a greater variety of ways.

**Prerequisites:** Stylized SpellUI, Bluff 10 ranks, Spellcraft 10 ranks.

**Benefit:** When you modify a spell with _[[feats/Stylized Spell|Stylized Spell]]_, you can apply one of the stylized magic options (see Stylized Magic below) without reducing the DC of the check to _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ the spell. In addition, you can apply up to two additional stylized magic options, reducing the DC of checks to _identify_ the spell by 5 per option as normal.
