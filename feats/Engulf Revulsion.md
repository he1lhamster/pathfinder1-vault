# Engulf Revulsion (Combat, Monster)

The stomach-churning terror of your smothering attack leaves creatures sick and weakened.

**Prerequisites:** _[[universal monster rules/Engulf|Engulf]]_ or _[[universal monster rules/Smother|smother]]_ universal monster ability.

**Benefit:** When you successfully _engulf_ or _smother_ an opponent, or successfully maintain a grapple combat maneuver on an engulfed or smothered opponent, that opponent must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Strength modifier) or become _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effect.
