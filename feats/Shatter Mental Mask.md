# Shatter Mental Mask (Combat)

You are adept at ripping away an opponent's mental _[[items/Mundane/Mask|mask]]_, exposing its true visage during a _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ duel.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Psychic Sensitivity|Psychic Sensitivity]]_ or ability to cast _psychic_ spells or use _psychic_ _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_, character level 2nd.

**Benefit:** While in a _psychic_ duel, when you create an offensive manifestation that can be negated or halved only with a successful Will saving throw, if your opponent fails that Will saving throw, its mental _mask_ is shattered, revealing the opponent's _[[spells/True Form|true form]]_.

**Special:** If you possess the _[[items/Wondrous Item/Third Eye|Third Eye]]_ feat, your opponent's mental _mask_ is shattered even on a successful Will saving throw.
