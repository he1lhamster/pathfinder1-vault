# Passing Trick (Combat)

Slipping past a foe gives you the chance to feint.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Dodge|Dodge]]_, _[[feats/Improved Feint|Improved Feint]]_, _[[feats/Mobility|Mobility]]_, size Small or smaller.

**Benefit:** Whenever you make a successful Acrobatics check to move through an opponent's space, you can spend a swift action to make a Bluff check against that opponent to feint in combat.

**Special:** If you have the _[[feats/Underfoot|Underfoot]]_ feat and the opponent is larger than you, you gain a +2 bonus on the Bluff check this feat allows.
