# Recruits

Be they students, retainers, new _[[feats/Recruits|recruits]]_ to your order, or neophyte members of your faith, you have access to a small set of dedicated servants.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, character level 5th.

**Benefit:** You gain a number of cohorts (as per the _[[feats/Leadership|Leadership]]_ feat) that represent NPCs you are responsible for instructing and overseeing. You have a number of such cohorts equal to half your character level. Unlike normal cohorts, these _recruits_ must be at least 4 levels lower than your level. Since these _recruits_ must spend most of their time studying and gaining experience, only one _[[npcs/Recruit|recruit]]_ can travel with you at a time (though they all gain experience at the same rate, as those not present are assumed to be studying and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Growing|growing]]_ independently). Whenever you are in a major town or city, you can exchange the _recruit_ currently accompanying you for a different member of your _recruits_. As _recruits_ are busy learning and studying the basics of their careers, those not traveling with you can't engage in mundane or magical crafting or Profession checks. _Recruits_ not traveling with you can, however, serve as managers for your holdings if you are using the downtime rules (Ultimate Campaign 88). If a _recruit_ dies, you take only a -1 penalty to your _Leadership_ score.

**Special:** The _Recruits_ feat counts as the _Leadership_ feat for purposes of fulfilling prerequisites. A character cannot have both _Leadership_ and _Recruits_. A character with _Recruits_ who later qualifies for _Leadership_ can exchange this feat for _Leadership_ immediately upon qualifying (selecting one minor cohort to become a full cohort, while the rest move on).
