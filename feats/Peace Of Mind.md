# Peace Of Mind (Conduit)

The blissful peace of Nirvana is never more than a thought away from your mind.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** As an immediate action when you fail a saving throw against an emotionUM, _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_, or painUM effect, you can ignore the effect and instead become _[[conditions/Dazed|dazed]]_ for an amount of time equal to twice the duration of the original effect. Any nonlethal damage you would have taken from the original effect is reduced to its minimum value (as though a 1 had been rolled on all dice). You cannot activate this ability if you are currently _dazed_. You can use this feat's benefit once per day, plus an additional time per day for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge (planes).
