# Swordplay Style (Combat, Style)

Your defense relies on perfectly timed attacks.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ with the chosen weapon, base attack bonus +3.

**Benefit:** Choose one weapon from the heavy blades or light blades _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_ weapon group. While using this style, wielding the chosen weapon, and fighting defensively or using either the total defense action or the _Combat Expertise_ feat, you gain a +1 _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ bonus to your Armor Class. In addition, you do not take the penalty on melee attacks from _Combat Expertise_ on the first attack roll you make each turn. You still take the penalty on additional attacks, including attacks of opportunity.

**Special:** A character with the _[[classes/Swashbuckler|swashbuckler]]_ weapon trainingACG or weapon _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ (heavy blades or light blades) class feature can use _[[feats/Swordplay Style|Swordplay Style]]_ with any light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, heavy blade, or light blade, respectively, in addition to the chosen weapon.
