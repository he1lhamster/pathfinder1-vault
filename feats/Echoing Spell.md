# Echoing Spell (Metamagic)

You have learned how to release most, but not all, of a spell's potential when you cast it.

**Benefit:** When you cast an _[[feats/Echoing Spell|echoing spell]]_, it does not disappear entirely from memory, and you can cast it one additional time during that day. No effect that allows you to reprepare or recast a spell can affect the echoed spell. If you prepare spells, this second casting does not require you to prepare it in another spell slot. If you spontaneously cast spells, this second casting does not _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ another available spell slot. An _echoing spell_ uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level.
