You have seen the outer reaches of the multiverse, and have gleaned knowledge from these alien realms. You have a special affinity for one of these realms in particular, and carry some of that plane's power within you.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (planes) 11 ranks, ability to cast _[[spells/Plane Shift|plane shift]]_ or _[[spells/Gate|gate]]_ as a spell or spell-like ability.

**Benefit:** Choose one of the planes below. The alignment of the plane must be within one step of your alignment. You gain a +2 bonus on saves against spells and _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ with the associated descriptor, and you cast spells with that descriptor at +1 caster level.
