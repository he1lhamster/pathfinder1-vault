# Stronghold (Story)

You seek to build a _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Bastion|bastion]]_ against which your enemies shall break like water against the rocks.

**Prerequisites:** You must have the _[[feats/Leadership|Leadership]]_ feat and must lead at least 10 combat-capable followers (such as fighters or rangers).

**Benefit:** You can spend a move action to give battle orders to your troops, granting creatures under your command within 60 feet your choice of a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, a +1 _[[feats/Dodge|dodge]]_ bonus to AC, or a +1 bonus on a single type of saving throw. All creatures must receive the same benefit. You can't use this benefit on allies not under your _command_. This is a language-dependent, mind-affecting effect.

**Goal:** Build or capture a _[[feats/Stronghold|stronghold]]_ capable of housing a force of at least 200 troops, and staff it with at least 100 combat-capable soldiers (or the equivalent) under your _command_. You must also provide food and water sufficient to survive at least a 6-month siege and a gold reserve sufficient for at least 6 months of wages if your troops require pay.

**Completion Benefit:** Your battle order bonuses improve to +2, and the range of your orders increases to 120 feet. In addition, you can give two different orders to your troops. For example, you could grant your archers +2 on attack rolls while your front line gains a +2 bonus to AC.
