# Kinetic Counter

You can use your kinetic blast to counter your enemy's opposing elemental abilities.

**Prerequisites:** Cold simple blast, fire simple blast, or water simple blast; kinetic blast class feature.

**Benefit:** You can ready an action to use your blast to counter an opponent's elemental abilities. If you ready a fire simple blast, you can counter any spell or activated extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability that has the water or ice descriptor, and if you ready a cold or water simple blast, you can counter any spell or activated extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability that has the fire descriptor. In order to successfully counter the effect, you must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to either 11 + the opponent's caster level (for spells and _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_) or 11 + the opponent's Hit Dice (for extraordinary and supernatural abilities). Against spells and _spell-like abilities_, treat a success as if you had counterspelled the effect using _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_. Against activated supernatural and extraordinary abilities, a successful _[[feats/Kinetic Counter|kinetic counter]]_ negates the ability's effect entirely while still expending the ability. For example, if a pyrokineticist succeeds at her caster level check against a white _[[spells/Dragon's Breath|dragon's breath]]_ weapon, she negates the _[[universal monster rules/Breath Weapon|breath weapon]]_'s effect in the entire area, and the dragon must wait 1d4 rounds to use its _breath weapon_ again.
