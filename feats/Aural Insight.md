# Aural Insight

You are able to emulate the _[[spells/Echolocation|echolocation]]_ techniques of bats.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Blind-Fight|Blind-Fight]]_, Improved Blind-FightAPG, Perception 10 ranks.

**Benefit:** By spending a move action to make a sound and listen for the echoes, you gain _[[universal monster rules/Blindsense|blindsense]]_ 30 feet until the end of your turn. Using this feat requires making audible sounds that impose a -4 penalty on your Stealth checks.

**Special:** This feat cannot be used if you are _[[conditions/Deafened|deafened]]_ or unable to make noise, and you cannot detect anything in areas that are magically silenced.
