# Greater Bull Rush (Combat)

Your bull rush attacks throw enemies off balance.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Bull Rush|Improved Bull Rush]]_, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, base attack bonus +6, Str 13.

**Benefit:** You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to bull rush a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by _Improved Bull Rush_. Whenever you bull rush an opponent, his movement provokes attacks of opportunity from all of your allies (but not you).

**Normal:** Creatures moved by bull rush do not provoke attacks of opportunity.
