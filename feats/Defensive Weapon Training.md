# Defensive Weapon Training (Combat)

You know how to defend yourself against a certain class of weaponry.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, base attack bonus +5.

**Benefit:** Choose a weapon group from the _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_'s weapon _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ class ability list (except natural weapons). You gain a +2 _[[feats/Dodge|dodge]]_ bonus on AC when an opponent attacks you using a weapon from that group. If you also have the weapon _training_ class feature in the selected group, your _dodge_ bonus from this feat increases to +3.

**Special:** You can select this feat more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time you select this feat, it applies to a different weapon group.
