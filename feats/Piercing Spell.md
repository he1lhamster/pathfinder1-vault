# Piercing Spell (Metamagic)

Your studies have helped you develop methods to overcome _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_.

**Benefit:** When you cast a _[[feats/Piercing Spell|piercing spell]]_ against a target with _spell resistance_, it treats the _spell resistance_ of the target as 5 lower than its actual SR. A _piercing spell_ uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
