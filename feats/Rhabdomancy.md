# Rhabdomancy

You have mastered the art of casting sticks, rods, or arrows to uncover secrets and find lost things, gaining insight from the way these objects fall.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (nature) 3 ranks, Survival 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** You can perform the dowsing occult skill unlockOA even if you can't use _[[universal monster rules/Psychic Magic|psychic magic]]_. If you can cast _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ spells or have the _Psychic_ SensitivityOA feat, you can use dowsing one additional time per day. Spending 1 minute casting sticks prior to attempting a Survival check grants you a +2 insight bonus on the check. In addition, you can cast sticks or rods while casting a spell that locates a creature or object (including _[[spells/Scrying|scrying]]_ effects) to increase the caster level of that spell by 1.
