# Amplified Rage (Teamwork)

When adjacent to other raging allies, your rages become even more powerful.

**Prerequisites:** Half-orc or _[[monsters/Orc|orc]]_, _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ class feature.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are raging and adjacent to a raging ally who also has this feat or flanking the same opponent as a raging ally with this feat, your morale bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by +4. This feat does not stack with itself (you only gain this bonus from one qualifying ally, regardless of how many are adjacent to you).
