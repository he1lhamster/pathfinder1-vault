# Ogre Crush

Your thick, muscular arms are capable of landing powerful blows and crushing the life out of the smaller creatures you embrace.

**Prerequisites:** Str 25, _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[monsters/Ogre|ogre]]_, size Large or larger.

**Benefit:** Your unarmed strike damage increases by one step when you're grappling creatures smaller than you. You gain the _[[universal monster rules/Constrict|constrict]]_ monster special ability, dealing an amount of damage equal to either the slam damage for a creature of your size or your unarmed strike damage, whichever is greater.
