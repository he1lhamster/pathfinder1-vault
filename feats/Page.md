# Page

You _[[npcs/Recruit|recruit]]_ a page who heralds your approach and has the ability to smooth the path of your diplomatic missions.

**Prerequisites:** Character level 4th, proficiency with martial weapons.

**Benefit:** This feat is similar to the _[[feats/Leadership|Leadership]]_ feat, with several exceptions. You can attract only a 1st-level cohort (referred to hereafter as a page) with this feat, and can't _recruit_ followers. You determine your _Leadership_ score according to the rules presented in the _Leadership_ feat, but your page is always at least 3 levels lower than your level. A page can take levels in _[[classes/Bard|bard]]_, cavalierAPG, or _[[classes/Paladin|paladin]]_. She cannot multiclass, though she can take any archetype for which she qualifies. Whenever a page tries to inf luence a creature's attitude by using the Diplomacy skill, she can use her total Diplomacy skill bonus or yours. Any improvement of a creature's attitude toward the page also applies to you. If a page gains enough XP to bring her to 2 levels lower than your level, she doesn't gain the new level until you gain your next level; until then, her XP total remains 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level and she gains no additional XP until you advance in level. If you release your page from service or otherwise lose your page, you can _recruit_ a new one. At 7th level, you can swap this feat for the _Leadership_ feat.
