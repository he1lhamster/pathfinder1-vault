# Awesome Throw (Combat)

Your ranged attacks can send smaller opponents flying.

**Prerequisites:** Str 25, _[[feats/Throw Anything|Throw Anything]]_ or _[[universal monster rules/Rock Throwing|rock throwing]]_, _[[feats/Improved Bull Rush|Improved Bull Rush]]_, size Large or larger.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can perform the _[[feats/Awesome Throw|awesome throw]]_ combat maneuver. You do this by making a thrown weapon attack; if you don't have the _Throw Anything_ feat, you must use a large, bulky, and relatively regular-shaped object with a hardness of at least 5 (such as a rock or treasure chest). If that attack hits a corporeal opponent smaller than you, the opponent takes damage and is knocked away, flying 10 feet in a straight line away from you and falling _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_. If an obstacle prevents the completion of your target's move, the target and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the target is knocked _prone_ in a space adjacent to the obstacle.
