# Starry Grace (Combat)

Your quick and free _[[items/Weapon/Starknife|starknife]]_ motions allow you to make _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ dexterous attacks.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Weapon Finesse|Weapon Finesse]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_starknife_).

**Benefit:** When wielding a _starknife_, you can add your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to that weapon's damage. The _starknife_ must be one appropriate for your size. You do not gain this benefit while fighting with two weapons or using flurry of blows, or any time another hand is otherwise occupied. In addition, if you have the panacheACG class feature, as long as you have at least 1 panache point, you gain a +5 bonus to your movement speed on your move action after taking an attack action with a _starknife_ or on your _[[feats/Spring Attack|Spring Attack]]_ or charge with a _starknife_.
