# Summon Guardian Spirit

A _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Guardian|guardian]]_ spirit has selected you as its ward.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to cast _[[spells/Summon Monster III|summon monster III]]_ or _[[spells/Summon Nature's Ally III|summon nature's ally III]]_.

**Benefit:** Select one creature that qualifies to be an _[[feats/Improved Familiar|improved familiar]]_, and apply the _guardian_ spirit template (see below) to it. That creature is added to either your _summon monster III_ or _summon nature's ally III_ list as a summonable creature. When you _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ your _guardian_ spirit, the duration of the spell you use to _summon_ it is 1 minute per level. A _guardian_ spirit is always exactly the same creature, with memory of all the events that occurred while previously summoned; multiple versions of it can't be summoned. If it's killed while summoned, it cannot be summoned again for 24 hours. If you're capable of casting a higher-level _summon_ monster or _summon_ nature's ally spell, you can perform a ritual to attune the _guardian_ spirit to a higher-level version of the spell. This also allows you to change any selections made regarding the abilities the creature gains based on the level of spell used to conjure it (see the table on page 27). This ritual takes 24 hours, and once complete it moves the _guardian_ spirit to the higher-level list of creatures that can be summoned.
