# Gluttonous Gobbler

Some ogres are able to quickly choke down even the largest of meals so they can get on with other business.

**Prerequisites:** Both _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_ and _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_ or the _[[universal monster rules/Grab|grab]]_ ability, _[[monsters/Ogre|ogre]]_, size Large or larger.

**Benefit:** If you start your turn grappling another creature at least two size categories smaller than you, you can put the _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ creature in your mouth as a move action and attempt another grapple combat maneuver check (as though attempting to pin the opponent). If you succeed, you swallow the opponent as if you had the _[[universal monster rules/Swallow Whole|swallow whole]]_ special ability.
