# Measured Response (Combat)

You believe that a conservative but consistent response guarantees success.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +1, worshiper of Abadar.

**Benefit:** When you hit an opponent with a melee or ranged weapon attack, you may choose to deal average damage (rounded down), as if you had rolled exactly the average amount on the damage die or dice. You add your damage bonuses and penalties as normal.
