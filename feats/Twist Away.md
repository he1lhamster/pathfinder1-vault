# Twist Away

Your quick reflexes and dexterous movements make up for your lack of stamina.

**Prerequisites:** Evasion.

**Benefit:** While you are wearing light armor or no armor, if you are forced to attempt a Fortitude saving throw, you can use an immediate action to instead attempt a Ref lex saving throw (at the same DC). If you succeed at this saving throw and the attack has a reduced effect on a successful save, you avoid the effect entirely. Whether the saving throw is successful or not, you are _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ until the end of your next turn. If you are prevented from becoming _staggered_, you can't use _[[feats/Twist Away|Twist Away]]_ , nor can you ignore the _staggered_ condition from _Twist Away_ or remove it early.
