# Meditative Concentration

Meditation clears your mind, allowing you to concentrate on your spells as if not distracted.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 13, _[[feats/Combat Meditation|Combat Meditation]]_, _[[feats/Meditation Master|Meditation Master]]_, character level 5th.

**Benefit:** For 1 round per character level after you perform _combat meditation_, whenever you attempt a concentration check to avoid losing a spell or a Fortitude save to resist a _[[universal monster rules/Distraction|distraction]]_ effect (such as the _distraction_ ability of a swarm), you gain a +4 bonus on the check. If you choose to use the benefits of _Combat Meditation_ on the check, the bonus applies to both die rolls.
