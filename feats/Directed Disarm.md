# Directed Disarm (Combat)

A weapon you _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ from one enemy's grip flies toward another enemy.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Greater Disarm|Greater Disarm]]_, _[[feats/Improved Disarm|Improved Disarm]]_, base attack bonus +11.

**Benefit:** Whenever you successfully use a combat maneuver to disarm an opponent, the disarmed weapon lands up to 15 feet away from its wielder, in the direction you choose. Alternatively, you can make a ranged attack as an immediate action with the disarmed weapon against another opponent, as long as the disarmed weapon is a light or one-handed weapon. If the weapon is not a thrown weapon, you take a -4 penalty on the attack roll. You take a -4 penalty on your attack roll if you do not have a free hand.
