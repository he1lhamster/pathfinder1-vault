# Burning Spell (Metamagic)

You cause creatures to take extra damage when you affect them with a spell that has the acid or fire descriptor.

**Benefit:** The acid or fire effects of the affected spell adhere to the creature, causing more damage the next round. When a creature takes acid or fire damage from the affected spell, that creature takes damage equal to 2 x the spell's actual level at the start of its next turn. The damage is acid or fire, as determined by the spell's descriptor. If a _[[feats/Burning Spell|burning spell]]_ has both the fire and acid descriptor, the caster chooses what kind of damage is dealt by the _burning spell_ effect. A _burning spell_ uses up a slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.
