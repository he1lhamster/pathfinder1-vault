# Shared Ownership (Teamwork)

The concept of ownership is rather flexible among you and your friends.

**Prerequisites:** Well-PreparedAPG, Sleight of Hand 1 rank, halfling.

**Benefit:** Whenever you're within 30 feet of a halfling ally who also has this feat, as a move action you can draw an item in that ally's _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_ as if it were on your person. This is not a magical effect-you just conveniently happen to remember that you had borrowed that item earlier. The item must be something that easily fits in a pocket or sleeve, such as a _[[items/Weapon/Dagger|dagger]]_, potion, wand, or scroll. When you or an ally draw an item (whether or not you do so using _[[feats/Shared Ownership|Shared Ownership]]_) or otherwise definitively establish who is holding the item, you can't use _Shared Ownership_ to draw the item in this manner until you have had at least 1 hour to mingle with your companions.
