# Revelation Strike (Combat)

Your unarmed strike brings a _[[spells/Revelation|revelation]]_ down upon your foe.

**Prerequisites:** _Revelation_ class feature, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_.

**Benefit:** When you gain this feat, choose one _revelation_ that you can use to affect no more than one opponent. If you make a successful unarmed strike against an opponent, in addition to dealing your unarmed strike damage, you can use a swift action to deliver the effects of the chosen _revelation_ to that opponent. Doing so provokes no attacks of opportunity.

**Special:** You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you take it, you apply it to a different qualifying _revelation_.
