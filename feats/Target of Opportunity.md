# Target of Opportunity (Combat, Teamwork)

You and your allies pelt your enemies with a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ barrage of missiles.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Point-Blank Shot|Point-Blank Shot]]_, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** When an ally who also has this feat makes a ranged attack and hits an opponent within 30 feet of you, you can spend an immediate action to make a single ranged attack against that opponent. Your ranged weapon must be in hand, loaded, and ready to be fired or thrown for you to make the ranged attack.
