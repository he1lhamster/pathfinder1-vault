# Ready For Pain

Your implanted trick hardens the body against damage.

**Prerequisites:** _[[classes/Mesmerist|Mesmerist]]_ trick class feature.

**Benefit:** When you implant a trick, you can grant the subject DR 1/- against nonlethal damage until the trick is triggered or its duration ends. This DR increases by 1 for every 5 _mesmerist_ levels you possess.
