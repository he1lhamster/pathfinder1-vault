# Ki Throw (Combat)

Your physical control and mastery of momentum allows you to throw enemies.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Trip|Improved Trip]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_.

**Benefit:** On a successful unarmed _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ attack against a target your size or smaller, you may throw the target _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ in any square you threaten rather than its own square. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and you cannot throw the creature into a space occupied by other creatures.

**Special:** A _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ may gain _[[feats/Ki Throw|Ki Throw]]_ as a bonus feat at 10th level. A _monk_ with this feat can affect creatures larger than his own size by spending 1 ki point per size category difference.
