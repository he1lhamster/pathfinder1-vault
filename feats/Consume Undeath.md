# Consume Undeath

You gain the powers of undeath when you feed upon their kind.

**Prerequisites:** Nabasu, Con 23

**Benefit:** As a full-round action, you can consume the animating force of any undead creature you have created with your death-stealing _[[universal monster rules/Gaze|gaze]]_. This immediately destroys the undead creature, but grants you one of that creature's special attacks or supernatural abilities (chosen from one of the following abilities possessed by the undead: Constitution drain, disease, _[[universal monster rules/Energy Drain|energy drain]]_, or _[[universal monster rules/Paralysis|paralysis]]_). The ability granted persists for 24 hours or until the next sunrise, whichever comes first.
