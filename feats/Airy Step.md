# Airy Step

The air responds to your innate elemental nature, protecting you from _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ and cushioning your falls.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Sylph|Sylph]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against effects with the air or electricity descriptors and effects that deal electricity damage. You may ignore the first 30 feet of any fall when determining falling damage.
