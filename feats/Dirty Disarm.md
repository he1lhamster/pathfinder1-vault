# Dirty Disarm (Combat)

You can _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ dirty tricks while disarming your foes.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, Improved Dirty TrickAPG, _[[feats/Improved Disarm|Improved Disarm]]_, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** You can attempt to perform a dirty trick and a disarm maneuver together against a single target as a full-round action. You attempt a single combat maneuver check for both maneuvers. If your CMB is different for the two types of maneuvers, use the lower of the two bonuses. If your target's CMD is different against the two types of maneuvers, use the higher CMD. If you succeed at the check, you successfully perform both combat maneuvers.
