# Stabbing Shot (Combat)

You can clear the way to continue using your bow.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Rapid Shot|Rapid Shot]]_, elf.

**Benefit:** When adjacent to an opponent and making a full-attack action with a _[[items/Weapon/Longbow|longbow]]_ or _[[items/Weapon/Shortbow|shortbow]]_ (including composite bows), you may choose to make a melee attack against that opponent with a drawn arrow rather than firing it. If the attack hits-whether or not it does damage-your target is pushed back 5 feet away from you. You can then fire arrows from your bow normally, at the original target, or at another target within range. This melee attack replaces the extra attack from _Rapid Shot_, and all of your attack rolls for the round (the melee attack and the ranged attacks) take a -2 penalty. If your initial attack leaves you with no enemies threatening you, you can make the subsequent ranged attack or attacks without provoking attacks of opportunity.
