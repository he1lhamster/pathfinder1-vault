# Flow Of Elements (Teamwork)

You can spontaneously channel your ally's elemental essence, be it _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Burning|burning]]_ fire, freezing ice, crackling lightning, or searing acid.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to cast spells; _[[monsters/Ifrit|ifrit]]_, _[[monsters/Oread|oread]]_, _[[monsters/Sylph|sylph]]_, or _[[monsters/Undine|undine]]_.

**Benefit:** Whenever you're adjacent to an _ifrit_, _oread_, _sylph_, or _undine_ ally who also has this feat, you can spontaneously replace or _[[universal monster rules/Split|split]]_ a spell's damage when casting it, as though the spell were affected by Elemental SpellAPG (without using a higher-level spell slot). The type of energy damage depends on your ally's race: acid for _oread_, electricity for _sylph_, fire for _ifrit_, or cold for _undine_.
