# Devil Sense

You instinctively sense the presence of fiends.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 13, ability to cast _[[spells/Detect Evil|detect evil]]_ as a spell or spell-like ability.

**Benefit:** At the beginning of your turn each round, if you are within 60 feet of an outsider with the evil subtype, you instinctively sense that something _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Unholy|unholy]]_ is near. You may experience this sense as an unpleasant smell or taste (such as sulfur), as gooseflesh on your arms or neck, or as an ineffable sense of dread. This sense does not alert you to the direction of the outsider. Anything that can thwart or _[[spells/Mislead|mislead]]_ _detect evil_ can likewise block this sense.
