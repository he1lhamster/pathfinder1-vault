# Dragonbane Aura

Those within your _[[feats/Dragonbane Aura|dragonbane aura]]_ gain the same protection that you do.

**Prerequisites:** Aura of courage class feature, caster level 8th.

**Benefit:** When fighting dragons, your aura of courage expands to a 20-foot-radius emanation, and allies in the aura gain a morale bonus on saving throws against dragon breath equal to your aura of courage's bonus against _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effects.

**Normal:** The aura of courage is a 10-foot-radius emanation, and grants a +4 morale bonus on _fear_ effects.
