# Owl Swoop (Combat)

Your martial _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ helps you move with _[[feats/Acrobatic|acrobatic]]_ poise.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15, _[[feats/Owl Style|Owl Style]]_, _[[feats/Skill Focus|Skill Focus]]_ (Stealth), Acrobatics 1 rank, Stealth 1 rank.

**Benefit:** While using _Owl Style_, you can use your base attack bonus in place of your ranks in Acrobatics to determine your Acrobatics skill bonus. You can attempt Acrobatics checks to move on narrow or _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Slick|slick]]_ surfaces and to avoid attacks of opportunity while charging, incurring the same penalties and increased DCs that you usually would apply for moving at full speed.
