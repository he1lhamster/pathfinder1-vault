# Eclipsed Spell (Metamagic)

You alter how your spells affect illumination.

**Benefit:** Only spells that create areas of light or _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_ can be eclipsed spells. If the _[[feats/Eclipsed Spell|eclipsed spell]]_ creates an area that shines like a _[[items/Mundane/Torch|torch]]_ or raises the light level by one step, you can choose to have the spell lower the illumination level in the affected area by one step, functioning like _darkness_. If the _eclipsed spell_ creates an area that shines like _[[spells/Daylight|daylight]]_ or raises the light level by two steps, you can choose to have the spell lower the illumination level in the affected area by two steps and create an area of magical _darkness_, functioning like _[[spells/Deeper Darkness|deeper darkness]]_. If the _eclipsed spell_ lowers the illumination level in the affected area by one step, you can choose to have the spell cause the affected area to glow with normal light, functioning like light. If the _eclipsed spell_ lowers the illumination level in the affected area by two steps, you can choose to have the spell cause the affected area to shed bright light, functioning like _daylight_. An _eclipsed spell_ does not use up a higher-level spell slot than the spell's actual level.
