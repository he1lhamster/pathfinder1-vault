# Staggering Blow (Combat)

You know just where to strike to temporarily stagger a foe.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, _[[feats/Vital Strike|Vital Strike]]_, base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit:** When you attack a foe using _Vital Strike_, you can choose to take a -2 penalty on your attack roll to also make the attack a staggering strike. You must make this choice before making the attack roll. If your attack roll is successful, your target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Strength modifier) or be _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ until the start of your next turn. Once a creature that failed its save recovers from the effects of your _[[feats/Staggering Blow|staggering blow]]_, it is immune to the effects of this feat for 24 hours. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ creatures, and creatures that are immune to critical hits are immune to this effect.
