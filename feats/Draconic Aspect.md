# Draconic Aspect

You possess some of the qualities of your dragon ancestors.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Kobold|Kobold]]_.

**Benefit:** Your scales take on the color and some of the resistances of one of the chromatic dragons. Choose one of the following chromatic dragon types: black (acid), blue (electricity), green (acid), red (fire), or white (cold). Your scales take on the color of that dragon, and you gain _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ 5 to the dragon color's corresponding energy type.

**Special:** If you have the dragon-scaled racial trait, your scale color does not change and you gain a +1 natural armor bonus instead.
