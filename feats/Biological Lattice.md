# Biological Lattice

You have practiced storing items in and retrieving them from the tangled vines on your back.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Gathlain|Gathlain]]_, racial fly speed.

**Benefit:** As a move action, you can store an item you are carrying in your vines. While you are holding an item in your vines, you lose your fly speed. You can retrieve the stored item as a swift action or drop it as a free action, immediately regaining your fly speed in either case.
