# Strongarm

You are experienced at long-term intimidation of those you _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ to exploit, and strike _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ into the hearts of those you bully.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Intimidating Prowess|Intimidating Prowess]]_, member of the Lumber Consortium.

**Benefit:** When you use the Intimidate skill to improve a target's attitude, if your check result exceeds the DC by 5 or more, the target's attitude is improved for 5d6 hours. During this time, should it attack you, the target immediately becomes _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 1d6+1 rounds, as though it had been demoralized.
