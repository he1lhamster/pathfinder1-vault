# Dispelling Fist

By focusing on your knowledge of magic and spells that negate its powers, you use your bare hands to rip magical defenses from your enemy.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +11, ability to cast _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_, caster level 7th.

**Benefit:** If you have _dispel magic_ prepared or can cast it spontaneously, you can cast it as a swift action after hitting an opponent with an unarmed strike. Treat this as a targeted dispel against the opponent you hit.
