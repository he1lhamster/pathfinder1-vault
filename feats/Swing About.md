# Swing About (Teamwork)

You can _[[universal monster rules/Grab|grab]]_ an ally and move her to a position near you.

**Prerequisites:** Escape RouteUC.

**Benefit:** If you have a free hand, as a move action you can _grab_ a willing adjacent ally who also has this feat and place her in any other space adjacent to you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You can do this only with allies who are able to move freely (not _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_, held, _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_, slowed, or otherwise suffering restricted movement) and who are of your size or smaller.
