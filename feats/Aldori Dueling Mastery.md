# Aldori Dueling Mastery (Combat)

You have mastered the impenetrable Aldori fighting style.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Exotic Weapon Proficiency|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]]_ (_[[items/Weapon/Aldori _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Dueling|dueling]]_ sword|Aldori _dueling_ sword]]_), _[[feats/Quick Draw|Quick Draw]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Finesse|Weapon Finesse]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_Aldori _dueling_ sword_).

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks as long as you start combat with an _Aldori _dueling_ sword_ in your hand. As long as you wield only a single _Aldori _dueling_ sword_ in one hand (not using a _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_, an off-hand weapon, armor spikes, unarmed strikes, or natural weapons), you gain a +2 _shield_ bonus to your AC. If you wield the sword in two hands, this bonus drops to a +1 _shield_ bonus to AC. Although the _dueling_ sword deals slashing damage, you treat it as if it were also a piercing weapon when determining the effects of weapons used by a duelist or _[[classes/Swashbuckler|swashbuckler]]_.
