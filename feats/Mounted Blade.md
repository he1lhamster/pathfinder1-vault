# Mounted Blade

You can use the momentum of your _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_ to carry your weapon through one foe and into another.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Mounted Combat|Mounted Combat]]_, _[[feats/Ride-By Attack|Ride-By Attack]]_, Ride 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** When you use the _Ride-By Attack_ feat, if your attack hits, you can also make an attack against a target adjacent to your original target. You take a -5 penalty on this additional attack, which does not benefit from any effects of a charge.
