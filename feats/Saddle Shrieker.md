# Saddle Shrieker (Combat)

You sometimes get carried away when encouraging your _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_ to fight.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Goblin|Goblin]]_, Ride 1 rank.

**Benefit:** You can choose to take a -1 penalty on all attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to grant your _mount_ a +1 bonus on all attack rolls and damage rolls made with natural weapons. These effects affect you and your _mount_ for 1 round. When your base attack bonus reaches +4, and every 4 points thereafter, this penalty increases by -1 and the bonus to your _mount_'s attack and damage increases by +1 to a maximum of +5. You must choose to use this feat before making an attack roll.
