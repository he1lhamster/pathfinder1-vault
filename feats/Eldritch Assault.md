# Eldritch Assault

You make _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ strikes when magic cloaks your location.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Blind-Fight|Blind-Fight]]_, _[[feats/Improved Initiative|Improved Initiative]]_.

**Benefit:** Whenever you attack from total concealment provided by a magical source (such as the _[[spells/Displacement|displacement]]_ or _[[spells/Invisibility|invisibility]]_ spells), the first attack roll you make each round that is a critical threat is automatically confirmed as a critical hit.
