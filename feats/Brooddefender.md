# Brooddefender

When someone under your protection is set upon, you react viciously against the attacker.

**Prerequisites:** BodyguardAPG, _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_, _[[monsters/Wyvaran|wyvaran]]_.

**Benefit:** If an opponent misses its attack on an ally after you successfully used the aid another action to improve that ally's AC this round, you can attempt an Intimidate check as an immediate action to demoralize that opponent.
