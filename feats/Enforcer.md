# Enforcer (Combat)

You are skilled at causing _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ in those you brutalize.

**Prerequisites:** Intimidate 1 rank.

**Benefit:** Whenever you deal nonlethal damage with a melee weapon, you can make an Intimidate check to demoralize your target as a free action. If you are successful, the target is _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for a number of rounds equal to the damage dealt. If your attack was a critical hit, your target is _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_ for 1 round with a successful Intimidate check, as well as being _shaken_ for a number of rounds equal to the damage dealt.
