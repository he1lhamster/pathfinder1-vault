# Resolute Rager

_[[universal monster rules/Fear|Fear]]_ passes quickly while you are raging.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Orc|Orc]]_, _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ class feature.

**Benefit:** While raging, when under the effect of a _fear_ effect that allows a saving throw, you can make a new saving throw against that _fear_ effect at the start of each of your turns before acting. If you make the new save, the _fear_ effect ends.
