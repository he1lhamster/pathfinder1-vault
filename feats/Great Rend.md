# Great Rend (Combat)

You use your teeth and claws to rip your foes to shreds.

**Prerequisites:** Bite attack, _[[universal monster rules/Rend|rend]]_, _[[monsters/Troll|troll]]_.

**Benefit:** If you are able to use your _rend_ ability on the same turn that you also succeed at a bite attack, your _rend_ deals an amount of additional damage equal to half your Strength modifier.
