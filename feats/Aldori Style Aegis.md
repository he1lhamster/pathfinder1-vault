# Aldori Style Aegis (Combat, style)

Baron Aldori's _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Dueling|dueling]]_ style is at its strongest when employed in one-on-one duels. Adjusting to a reverse grip and keeping your blade in motion, you parry your _[[feats/Rival|rival]]_'s strikes with ease.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Aldori Style|Aldori Style]]_, _[[feats/Alertness|Alertness]]_, _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_, _[[feats/Exotic Weapon Proficiency|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]]_ (_[[items/Weapon/Aldori _dueling_ sword|Aldori _dueling_ sword]]_), _[[feats/Weapon Finesse|Weapon Finesse]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_Aldori _dueling_ sword_).

**Benefit:** While using _Aldori Style_, at the beginning of your turn, you can designate a _[[feats/Focused Target|focused target]]_ as a swift action. This designation lasts until the beginning of your next turn, and you take a -2 penalty to your AC against all other creatures' attacks for that duration. As an immediate action while using _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_ or fighting defensively, you can attempt to parry the _focused target_'s attack. This functions as the _[[classes/Swashbuckler|swashbuckler]]_'s opportune parry and riposte deed (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 57), except that it does not cost panache and you cannot riposte.
