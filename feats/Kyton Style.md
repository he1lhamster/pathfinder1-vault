# Kyton Style (Combat, Style)

Your fighting style emulates the disciplined nature of the kytons, with passion and pain held tightly in chains.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 13, _[[feats/Exotic Weapon Proficiency|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]]_ (_[[items/Weapon/Spiked chain|spiked chain]]_), Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks, ki pool class feature.

**Benefit:** When using this style, you treat spiked chains as if they had the _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ special weapon feature. Additionally, if you have _[[feats/Stunning Fist|Stunning Fist]]_, you can spend 1 point from your ki pool to make a _Stunning Fist_ attack with your _spiked chain_ instead of an unarmed strike. This still costs a use of _Stunning Fist_ as normal.
