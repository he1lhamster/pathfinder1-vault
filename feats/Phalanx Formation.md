# Phalanx Formation (Combat)

You are trained to use long weapons in tight formations.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** When you wield a reach weapon with which you are proficient, allies don't provide soft cover to opponents you attack with reach.

**Normal:** Attacking a target that is beyond another creature, even an ally, can result in the target having soft cover from you.
