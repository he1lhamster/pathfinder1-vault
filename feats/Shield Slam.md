# Shield Slam (Combat)

In the right position, your _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ can be used to send opponents flying.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved _Shield_ Bash|Improved _Shield_ Bash]]_, _[[feats/Shield Proficiency|Shield Proficiency]]_, _[[feats/Two-Weapon Fighting|Two-Weapon Fighting]]_, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** Any opponents hit by your _shield_ bash are also hit with a free bull rush attack, substituting your attack roll for the combat maneuver check (see Chapter 8). This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Opponents who cannot move back due to a wall or other surface are knocked _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ after moving the maximum possible distance. You may choose to move with your target if you are able to take a 5-foot step or to spend an action to move this turn.
