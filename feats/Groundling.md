# Groundling

You can speak with burrowing animals.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, gnome, gnome magic racial trait.

**Benefit:** You can use _[[spells/Speak with Animals|speak with animals]]_ as a spell-like ability at will, but only to communicate with burrowing animals like gophers, moles, and the like. You can still use your gnome _speak with animals_ ability once per day to speak with any animal, as usual.
