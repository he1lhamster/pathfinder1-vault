# Improved Sabotaging Sunder (Combat)

You become further adept at sabotaging your foes' items.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Improved Sunder|Improved Sunder]]_, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, _[[feats/Sabotaging Sunder|Sabotaging Sunder]]_, Disable Device 9 ranks.

**Benefit:** You do not provoke an attack of opportunity when performing the special sunder combat maneuver from the _Sabotaging Sunder_ feat. In addition, you can attempt to use that maneuver on items held by the target, but you still cannot do so against items hidden in a bag, a pack, or another container.
