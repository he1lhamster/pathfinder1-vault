# Pesh Euphoria

The _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Calming|calming]]_ effects of _[[items/Mundane/Pesh|pesh]]_ make you difficult to disturb.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Sahir-Afiyun|Sahir-Afiyun]]_ or _pesh_ addict.

**Benefit:** When you take a dose of _pesh_, in addition to its normal initial effect, you gain a +2 bonus on saves against emotionUM and _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effects. Once per day, if you fail a saving throw against an emotionUM or _fear_ effect while you are under the initial effect of _pesh_, you can attempt another saving throw 1 round later at the same DC.
