# Take A Breather (Combat)

You can use lapses in your opponent's _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_ to recuperate from the wounds you have already sustained.

**Prerequisites:** Con 13, _[[feats/Combat Vigor|Combat Vigor]]_*, character level 4th.

**Benefit:** Your _[[spells/Vigor|vigor]]_ pool gains 1 _vigor_ point. Whenever an opponent that you threaten provokes an attack of opportunity from you, as a swift action you can spend 1 or more _vigor_ points to regain hit points as described by the _Combat Vigor_ feat, instead of making an attack of opportunity against that opponent. Spending _vigor_ in this manner does not count against the total number of attacks of opportunity that you can make during a round.
