# Shark Leap (Combat)

Like a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ predator, you bolt at unsuspecting foes from below.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Shark Style|Shark Style]]_, _[[feats/Shark Tear|Shark Tear]]_, Swim 10 ranks, base attack bonus +10 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 10th.

**Benefit:** While in _Shark Style_, when you're _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_ with neutral, rising, or swiftly rising _[[spells/Buoyancy|buoyancy]]_, you can perform a terrifying leap to attack opponents directly above you. This works similarly to the charge action, except you can move only straight up, and you make a single piercing unarmed strike or bite attack. If the attack hits, it deals double damage; if the attack roll's result is also higher than 11 + the target's Swim modifier, the attack knocks the target off-balance until its next turn. Like with a charge, you can perform a partial version when limited to a single standard action (such as in the surprise round); in addition to moving half as far as normal for a partial charge, the attack doubles only the damage dice (as per _[[feats/Vital Strike|Vital Strike]]_) rather than the full damage roll.
