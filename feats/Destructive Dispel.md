# Destructive Dispel

When you dispel an enemy's magical defenses, those defenses crash down with _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Debilitating|debilitating]]_ effects.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to cast _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ or greater _dispel magic_, caster level 11th.

**Benefit:** When you successfully make a targeted dispel check against an opponent, that opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC equals the DC of the spell used to dispel) or be _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_ until the start of your next turn. If the save succeeds, the opponent is instead _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ until the start of your next turn.
