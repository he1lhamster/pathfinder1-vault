# Oread Burrower

The ground parts for you at the slightest touch, allowing you to dig with great speed.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Stony Step|Stony Step]]_, character level 9th, _[[monsters/Oread|oread]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain a _[[universal monster rules/Burrow|burrow]]_ speed equal to 1/2 your base speed. You can _burrow_ through sand, dirt, _[[items/Mundane/Clay|clay]]_, gravel, or similar materials, but not solid stone. You do not leave a hole behind, nor is your passage marked on the surface.
