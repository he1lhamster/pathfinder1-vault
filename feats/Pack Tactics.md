# Pack Tactics

You have trained your animal companion to fight using your tactics.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, animal companion class feature.

**Benefit:** Your animal companion is treated as having all the same teamwork feats that you do for the purpose of determining whether you or your allies receive a bonus from teamwork feats. Your animal companion doesn't receive any bonuses from these feats unless it actually possesses the teamwork feats. Your and all allies' positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in a teamwork feat's description in order to receive the teamwork feat's listed bonus.
