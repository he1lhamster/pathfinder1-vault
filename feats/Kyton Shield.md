Whether in your hand or draped around your body, the _[[items/Weapon/Spiked chain|spiked chain]]_ serves as both weapon and _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 15, _[[feats/Exotic Weapon Proficiency|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]]_ (_spiked chain_), _[[feats/Kyton Style|Kyton Style]]_, base attack bonus +5, Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks, ki pool class feature.

**Benefit:** When using _Kyton Style_, you gain a +1 _shield_ bonus to your Armor Class as long as you are wielding a _spiked chain_.
