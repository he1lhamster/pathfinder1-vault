# Clawwrench (Combat)

You can pry open a mighty beast's _[[spells/Grasp|grasp]]_ or _[[feats/Snapping Jaws|snapping jaws]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can attempt a grapple combat maneuver with a -5 penalty against a creature that is currently grappling another creature via its _[[universal monster rules/Grab|grab]]_ special ability. If you succeed, you pry open the creature's _grasp_, releasing any creatures it had _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_. Additionally, you can ready an action to trigger if a creature attempts a bite attack against you. When the readied action triggers, you can attempt a grapple combat maneuver with a +2 bonus. If you succeed, you grapple the creature and cause the bite attack to miss. As long as you maintain the grapple, the creature can't use its bite attack.
