# Glimpse Beyond (Story)

You have glimpsed the madness at the edges of reality.

**Prerequisites:** You must have faced an undead, evil outsider, or aberration with a CR greater than your level +4, or have the Raised Among the Dead or The Dead One background.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering) checks to _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ the _[[universal monster rules/Vulnerabilities|vulnerabilities]]_ and powers of aberrations, Knowledge (planes) checks to _identify_ the _vulnerabilities_ and powers of evil outsiders, and Knowledge (religion) checks to _identify_ the _vulnerabilities_ and powers of undead, and you can make such checks untrained. If you have 10 or more ranks in any of these Knowledge skills, the bonus increases to +4 for the appropriate skill. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on saves against _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effects.

**Goal:** Be killed or driven insane (as determined by the GM) by an aberration, evil outsider, or undead. This leaves your mind permanently marked.

**Completion Benefit:** Any sane creature that attempts to read your thoughts takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage (Will DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Charisma modified negates). In addition, the effect of any ability damage, ability drain, or penalty to your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is halved (minimum 1). You take a -2 penalty on Will saving throws. Whenever you roll a save against a mind-affecting effect, roll twice and keep the better result.
