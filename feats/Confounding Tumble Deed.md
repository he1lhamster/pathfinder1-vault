# Confounding Tumble Deed (Panache)

You can befuddle a foe by striking a blow after tumbling.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Amateur Swashbuckler|Amateur Swashbuckler]]_ feat or panache class feature, _[[feats/Canny Tumble|Canny Tumble]]_, Acrobatics 7 ranks.

**Benefit:** When you use Acrobatics to move through an opponent's threatened area or space without provoking an attack of opportunity from that opponent and then hit that foe with a melee attack in the same round, as a free action you can spend 1 panache point to deny that foe its Dexterity bonus to its armor class until the end of your next turn.
