# Focused Vermin Expertise (Combat)

Your experience with vermin resists the attacks of swarms.

**Prerequisites:** Favored enemy (vermin) class feature.

**Benefit:** You gain DR/- equal to half your favored enemy (vermin) bonus against vermin and creatures with the swarm subtype. When attempting Fortitude saves against a swarm's _[[universal monster rules/Distraction|distraction]]_ ability, you gain a bonus on the save equal to the damage prevented by this feat. Against vermin with the swarm subtype, the amount of _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_ is equal to your full favored enemy (vermin) bonus. This _damage reduction_ does not stack with that from other sources.
