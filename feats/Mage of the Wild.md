# Mage of the Wild

Your mystic connection with the wilderness enhances your spellcasting.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Attuned to the Wild|Attuned to the Wild]]_, elf.

**Benefit:** When you are in a terrain type you have selected the _Attuned to the Wild_ feat for, you gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks, concentration checks, and, Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft checks. If you are in an area that qualifies as more than one kind of terrain, these bonuses do not stack; you receive the bonus for only one of the terrain types.
