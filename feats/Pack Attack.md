# Pack Attack (Combat, Teamwork)

You are skilled at surrounding your enemies.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** When you are adjacent to an ally with this feat, the first time you melee attack an opponent, you can spend an immediate action to take a 5-foot step, even if you have otherwise moved this round.

**Normal:** You can take a 5-foot step only if you have not otherwise moved in a round.
