# Craft Technological Item

You can craft technological gear and items.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Technologist|Technologist]]_, Craft (mechanical) 5 ranks, Knowledge (engineering) 5 ranks

**Benefit:** You can create technological gear. Creating a piece of technological gear takes 1 day for every 1,000 gp in the item's price. To create the object, you must use up raw materials costing half of this total price. See Crafting High- Tech Items on page 16 for more information. You can also repair a _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ technological item if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the raw materials and half the time it would take to craft that item from scratch.
