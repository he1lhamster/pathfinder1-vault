# Deadly Horns (Combat)

Many tieflings bear horns as an overt mark of their fiendish heritage; you have learned to use yours as a weapon.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +1, _[[monsters/Tiefling|tiefling]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain a gore natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. Due to the awkwardness of attacking this way, you can't make a gore attack and other natural weapon attacks as part of the same full attack. Treat your gore attack as a secondary attack if you also attack with a manufactured weapon as part of a full attack in a round.
