# Apotheosis (Story)

You are marked by fate as a future deity-even before this destiny is realized, fate bends to your will.

**Prerequisites:** You must have had direct contact with a deity or godlike being, or have been risen from the dead at the personal behest of a deity or godlike being.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on Constitution checks to stabilize while _[[conditions/Dying|dying]]_. Anytime you or an ally who worships the god that contacted you casts _[[spells/Augury|augury]]_ or a similar effect, your chance of receiving a meaningful reply is increased by 5% (to a maximum of 95%).

**Goal:** You must be acknowledged by another divine being (directly or through a representative) as a peer, even if only a minor one.

**Completion Benefit:** Once per day as an immediate action, you can cause any die roll made by a creature within 100 feet of you to be rerolled. You choose which result you prefer. You must decide to use this ability after the first roll is made but before the results are revealed by the GM.

**Suggested Traits:** Called, Fortunate, Inspiring.
