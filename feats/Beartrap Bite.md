# Beartrap Bite (Combat)

You can hold your foes even if you do not manage to grapple them.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (bite), base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** Whenever you confirm a critical hit against a foe with your bite attack, if your confirmation roll matches or exceeds your foe's CMD, you can clamp down on your foe to prevent it from moving away as a free action. The foe cannot move outside the area threatened by your bite attack unless it breaks free of your bite. It can attempt to free itself with a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as if you were grappling it, but neither of you gains the _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ condition. You cannot use your bite attack while you maintain your grip on your foe, but you can release the bite as a swift action to end the effect.
