# Usurping Spell (Metamagic)

Like Daronlyr the Overthrower, you lay such brazen claim to power that you force targets of your spells to act as though they were your allies.

**Benefit:** A creature that fails its saving throw against a _[[feats/Usurping Spell|usurping spell]]_ counts as your ally rather than your enemy for the purpose of flanking other creatures and cannot make attacks of opportunity against you. This effect lasts for the duration of the spell or for 1 round, whichever is longer. A _usurping spell_ uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.
