# Painful Anchor

Evil outsiders take damage when they attempt to connect to other planes.

**Prerequisites:** _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Anchoring|Anchoring]]_ aura class feature.

**Benefit:** When an evil outsider uses a calling, summoning, or teleportation effect, or any ability that physically transports a creature to or from another plane (such as _[[spells/Blink|blink]]_ or _[[spells/Etherealness|etherealness]]_) within your _anchoring_ aura, it takes damage equal to 4d8 + your Charisma modifier. This damage comes from holy power and is not subject to _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_, energy immunities, or energy resistances.
