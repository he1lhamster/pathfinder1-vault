# Slaying Sprint (Combat)

With swift feet and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ intent, you finish off your target before anyone sees your blade.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Dodge|Dodge]]_, _[[feats/Mobility|Mobility]]_, _[[feats/Spring Attack|Spring Attack]]_, base attack bonus +13

**Benefit:** You can move up to half your speed instead of taking a 5-foot step when taking a full-round action to perform a coup de _[[spells/Grace|grace]]_. Performing a coup de _grace_ does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You can use this feat only when wielding a light or onehanded weapon.
