# Iconoclast (Combat)

You know how to turn a holy symbol into a weapon against her followers.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Divine Defiance|Divine Defiance]]_, _[[feats/Improved Sunder|Improved Sunder]]_, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, Intimidate 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** When you succeed at a sunder combat maneuver against a holy or _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Unholy|unholy]]_ symbol, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize as a free action. This demoralization affects all followers of the deity or philosophy whose symbol you sundered who _[[items/Mundane/Saw|saw]]_ you sunder it and are within 30 feet. If you destroyed the symbol, you gain a +5 bonus on your Intimidate check. You can use this feat when sundering any physical holy symbol-it doesn't have to be the hand-held variety commonly used by clerics and other divine spellcasters.
