# Stag Horns (Combat, Style)

You've learned to gain the upper hand against your enemies by charging at them with feigned abandon, yet gaining a strong grip on them after attacking.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Charging Stag Style|Charging Stag Style]]_, _[[feats/Dodge|Dodge]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Mobility|Mobility]]_.

**Benefit:** While using _Charging Stag Style_, if you make a successful unarmed attack at the end of a charge, you can attempt a free grapple check against the target of your charge without provoking an attack of opportunity.

**Normal:** Attempting a grapple requires a standard action, which provokes an attack of opportunity from your target unless you have the _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_ feat.
