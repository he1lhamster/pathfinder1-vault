# Dorn-Dergar Master (Combat)

You can use a dorn-dergar with only one hand.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Two-Weapon Fighting|Two-Weapon Fighting]]_, base attack bonus +4, proficiency with the dwarven dorn-dergar.

**Benefit:** You can use a dorn-dergar as a one-handed weapon. When using it one-handed, changing whether it's a normal or reach weapon is a full-round action. If you have the _[[feats/Darting Viper|Darting Viper]]_ feat, changing its reach is a move action.

**Normal:** A dorn-dergar requires two hands to wield.
