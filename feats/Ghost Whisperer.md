# Ghost Whisperer

Your words soothe the dead and undead alike, and can even affect haunts.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to cast 3rd-level spells.

**Benefit:** You gain Necril as a bonus language, and gain a +2 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks against undead creatures or when you speak Necril. Add _[[spells/Speak with Dead|speak with dead]]_ to your list of spells known. As soon as you gain the ability to cast 4th-level spells, add speak with hauntACG to your list of spells known. Whenever you cast _speak with dead_ or _[[spells/Speak With Haunt|speak with haunt]]_, treat your alignment as identical to that of the dead creature or haunt with which you are speaking, and increase the effective caster level of the spell by 2.
