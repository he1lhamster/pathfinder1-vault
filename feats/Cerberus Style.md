# Cerberus Style (Combat, Style)

You rain blows upon your enemies from three directions, like the three heads of the cerberus guardians of Hell.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Cleave|Cleave]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +6 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 6th.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can make a single unarmed strike at your full base attack bonus against a foe within reach. If you hit, you deal damage normally and can make an additional attack (using your full base attack bonus) against up to two other foes that are also within reach. You take a -2 penalty to your Armor Class until the start of your next turn for each additional attack you make with this feat.
