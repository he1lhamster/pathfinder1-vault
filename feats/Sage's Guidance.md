# Sage's Guidance (Familiar)

Your familiar's _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Keen|keen]]_ observations help you defeat foes.

**Prerequisites:** Must have a familiar with the sage archetype (see page 11).

**Benefit:** When your familiar succeeds at a Knowledge check to _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ a hazard or an opponent's weaknesses and abilities, you gain a +2 insight bonus on attacks and skill checks against the opponent or hazard for 1 round. If your familiar is sharing a space with the opponent or hazard, this bonus is granted to all allies who can see and understand the familiar.
