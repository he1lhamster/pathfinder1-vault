# Lead from the Back (Combat)

You allies depend far too much on your _[[feats/Leadership|leadership]]_ and encouraging words for you to actually put yourself in harms' way.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Goblin|Goblin]]_, Intimidate 1 rank.

**Benefit:** During any round in which you gain the benefit of cover or concealment against at least one opponent, and you are not threatened by any opponent, you can bark orders and encouragement to your allies as a standard action. Doing so grants all allies within 30 feet a +1 bonus on all weapon damage rolls for 1 round.
