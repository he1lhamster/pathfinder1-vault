# Spell Hex

You can transform a 1st-level spell into a hex.

**Prerequisites:** Major hex class feature.

**Benefit:** Select one 1st-level spell in the class that grants you the major hex class feature. You can learn that spell as a hex, and can use that hex three times per day. This is a spell-like ability. You use your class level in the major-hex-granting class as your caster level for the _[[feats/Spell Hex|spell hex]]_. The _spell hex_ uses your hex DC instead of its original spell DC. If the spell is a touch spell and you miss the creature, you cannot target the creature with that _spell hex_ again for 24 hours. If the spell allows a saving throw to negate or take a partial effect from the spell, and the target succeeds at that saving throw, it cannot be affected by the _spell hex_ for 24 hours, even if it is in the area of the _spell hex_.
