# Drunken Brawler (Combat)

You have learned how to fight effectively while drunk.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Endurance|Endurance]]_, worshiper of Cayden Cailean.

**Benefit:** When you drink a tankard of ale or strong alcohol, you take a -2 penalty on Ref lex saving throws, but gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your character level, and gain a +2 alchemical bonus on Fortitude and Will saving throws. These bonuses last 1 hour or until the temporary hit points gained by this effect are lost, whichever occurs first. Regardless, the penalty lasts for a full hour.
