# Dangerous Tail (Combat)

You have trained your tail into a powerful weapon, and wield it with _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ skill.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +5, _[[monsters/Lizardfolk|Lizardfolk]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain a tail _[[spells/Swipe|swipe]]_ attack. If used as part of a full-attack action, the attack is made at your full base attack bonus - 5. If the tail _swipe_ hits, it deals 1d4 points of damage (assuming you are _[[classes/Medium|Medium]]_) + 1/2 your Strength modifier. If you confirm a critical hit against a target with your tail _swipe_, as a free action you can attempt a _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ combat maneuver against that target.
