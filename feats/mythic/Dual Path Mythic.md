# Dual Path (Mythic)

You follow two mythic paths.

**Prerequisites:** 1st mythic tier.

**Benefit:** Select a mythic path other than the path you selected at your moment of _[[spells/Ascension|ascension]]_. You gain that path's 1st-tier ability (either archmage arcana, _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Champion|champion]]_'s strike, divine surge, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Guardian|guardian]]_'s call, marshal's order, or trickster attack). Each time you gain a path ability, you can select that path ability from either path's list or the list of universal path abilities.
