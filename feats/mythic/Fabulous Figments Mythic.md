# Fabulous Figments (Mythic)

Your illusions are astonishingly realistic.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Spell Focus|Spell Focus]]_ (illusion).

**Benefit:** Non-mythic creatures can't _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ your illusion spells with Spellcraft, including checks attempted as part of _[[spells/Arcane Sight|arcane sight]]_, _[[spells/Detect Magic|detect magic]]_, or similar effects. When mythic creatures attempt to _identify_ your illusions, add your tier to the DC of those Spellcraft checks. Mythic creatures informed by their allies that one of your illusions isn't real gain only a +2 bonus on their Will saves to disbelieve. Non-mythic creatures gain no bonus to disbelieve.
