# Mythic Paragon (Mythic)

Your mythic power is even more _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ than that of most other mythic beings.

**Benefit:** Your tier is considered 2 higher for determining the potency of mythic abilities, feats, and spells. This doesn't grant you access to mythic abilities or greater versions of mythic spells at a lower tier than you would normally need to be to get them, nor does it grant you additional uses of mythic power or adjust the dice you roll for your surge.
