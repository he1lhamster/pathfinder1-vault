# Valiant Vault (Mythic)

Your _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_ can make heroic leaps.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Mounted Combat|Mounted Combat]]_, _[[feats/Ride-By Attack|Ride-By Attack]]_, Ride 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** Your _mount_ is always considered to have a running start when using Acrobatics to _[[spells/Jump|jump]]_. You can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ one use of mythic power to grant your _mount_ a +10 bonus on an Acrobatics check, or a +20 bonus if the check is made to _jump_. When making a mounted charge, you can guide your _mount_ to leap over a foe between your starting position and the target of your charge. You make a Ride check or your _mount_ makes an Acrobatics check (whichever is lower) during the charge, using the rules for the leap task under the Ride skill. If the height you clear with that check exceeds the creature's height, you _jump_ over it and continue your charge on the opposite side. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, you can vault over your target while making a _Ride-By Attack_, allowing you to move over or through its space and continue moving on the opposite side of it. If your _jump_ exceeds the target's height, you gain a +1 bonus on the attack roll for higher ground, and if any of your allies threatens the target, you treat the target as flanked for purposes of your _Ride-By Attack_.
