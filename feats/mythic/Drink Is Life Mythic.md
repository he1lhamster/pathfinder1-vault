# Drink Is Life (Mythic)

Strong drink fuels the mythic fires within you.

**Prerequisites:** Con 19, 3rd mythic tier.

**Benefit:** You never take penalties for consuming nonmagical alcohol, and you can consume an alcoholic beverage as a swift action instead of a move action. Each time you consume an alcoholic beverage, you may gain one of the benefits of _[[spells/Polypurpose Panacea|polypurpose panacea]]_ (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 232). You can have only one of these benefits active at a time. If you _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ one use of mythic power while drinking an alcoholic beverage, you can _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ 2 points of ability damage, negate a temporary penalty to one ability score, or remove one of the following conditions: _[[conditions/Confused|confused]]_, diseased, _[[conditions/Exhausted|exhausted]]_, _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_, _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_, _[[conditions/Nauseated|nauseated]]_, poisoned, _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_, _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_, or _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_.
