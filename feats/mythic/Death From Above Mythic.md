# Death From Above (Mythic)

When attacking from the air or higher ground, you bear down on your enemy to _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ effect.

**Prerequisites:** Death from AboveUC.

**Benefit:** Whenever you charge an opponent from higher ground, or from above while flying, the critical multiplier of your weapon increases by 2 (to a maximum of x6). This doesn't stack with other abilities that increase a weapon's critical multiplier. If your charge attack hits, you can perform a _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ combat maneuver against the attack's target as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity.
