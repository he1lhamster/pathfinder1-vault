# Press To The Wall (Combat)

You gain an advantage when your opponent can't easily retreat.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Step Up|Step Up]]_, base attack bonus +3.

**Benefit:** If you are the only character threatening an opponent, you can treat solid, immovable objects that occupy a square (such as columns, tree trunks, and walls) and are adjacent to that opponent as allies threatening the opponent when determining whether you flank the foe.
