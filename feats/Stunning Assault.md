# Stunning Assault (Combat)

You powerful but imprecise attacks can stun your enemies.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, base attack bonus +16.

**Benefit:** You can choose to take a -5 penalty on all melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to stun targets you hit with your melee attacks for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates the effect. The DC of this save is 10 + your base attack bonus. You must choose to use this feat before making the attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn.
