# Spontaneous Nature's Ally

Instead of casting a cure spell, you can instead cast _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ nature's ally.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (nature) 5 ranks, ability to spontaneously cast cure spells or inflict spells, Animal or Plant domain.

**Benefit:** You can "lose" a prepared spell in order to cast any _summon_ nature's ally spell of the same level or lower, instead of casting a cure spell or an inflict spell as you normally would. For the purpose of this feat only, the _summon_ nature's ally spells of the appropriate spell levels count as being on your spell list at the same spell level as for a _[[classes/Druid|druid]]_.
