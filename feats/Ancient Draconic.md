# Ancient Draconic

You empower spells using the ancient language of dragons.

**Prerequisites:** Arcane caster level 5th, speaks Draconic.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on caster level checks to overcome _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ when casting arcane spells that have a verbal component. If you speak Draconic when casting an arcane language-dependent spell, all intelligent creatures with a language can understand your words.
