# Lovable Scoundrel

You're charming enough that others assume your criminal inclinations are delightful quirks.

**Prerequisites:** Bluff 1 rank, Diplomacy 1 rank, _[[monsters/Tengu|tengu]]_.

**Benefit:** If you fail a Bluff check to deceive, an Intimidate check to gain a target's cooperation, or a Sleight of Hand check to steal from another creature, you can immediately attempt a Diplomacy check against the same DC as a free action. If you succeed, your target assumes your actions were in jest or just some awkward _tengu_ tradition, and its attitude toward you does not immediately worsen (though later actions can still shift its attitude toward hostile). You can use this feat only once per day per target.
