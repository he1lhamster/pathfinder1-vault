# Otherworldy Influence (Story)

Extradimensional forces vie for your soul, and have offered you riches and power to claim it.

**Prerequisites:** You must have refused an evil creature with at least 15 Hit Dice who offered gifts or assistance, have refused an evil creature offering to cast a spell of 7th-level or higher on your behalf, or have the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Planar|Planar]]_ Offering background.

**Benefit:** When negotiating with evil outsiders, you gain a +2 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks. You gain an amount of _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ equal to 5 + your character level against spells and _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ originating from outsiders with the evil subtype.

**Goal:** Receive a boon from an evil creature that is equivalent in value to a month's service or an 8th-level spell without becoming indebted to the creature or giving up anything in return. This cannot be the result of magical compulsion.

**Completion Benefit:** You gain an amount of _spell resistance_ equal to 5 + your character level against spells or _spell-like abilities_ originating from outsiders.
