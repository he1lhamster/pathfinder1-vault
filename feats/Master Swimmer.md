# Master Swimmer

You've trained at swimming in combat and over long distances for so long that you can move through the water like a native.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Skill Focus|Skill Focus]]_ (Swim), Swim 10 ranks.

**Benefit:** You gain a swim speed of 30 feet or your unmodified base land speed, whichever is slower; your racial bonus on Swim checks for having a swim speed is +2, instead of +8.
