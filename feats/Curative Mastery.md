# Curative Mastery (Item Mastery)

You can invoke a magic item's innate conjuration magic to conjure positive energy for healing wounds.

**Prerequisites:** Use Magic Device 1 rank, base Fortitude bonus +2.

**Benefit:** You can cause an item that has a 1st-level or higher conjuration spell listed in its construction requirements to cast _[[spells/Cure Light Wounds|cure light wounds]]_ as a spell-like ability, using the item's caster level as the spell's caster level. You can use this feat once per day, plus one additional time per day when your base Fortitude save bonus reaches +4, +6, +8, +10, and +12. You can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ two uses of this feat to cast _[[spells/Cure Moderate Wounds|cure moderate wounds]]_, three uses to cast _[[spells/Cure Serious Wounds|cure serious wounds]]_, four uses to cast _[[spells/Cure Critical Wounds|cure critical wounds]]_, and five uses to cast _[[spells/Breath Of Life|breath of life]]_, provided that the item's construction requirements include a spell whose level is equal to or greater than the level of the spell-like ability to be used (2nd level for _cure moderate wounds_, 3rd level for _cure serious wounds_, 4th level for _cure critical wounds_, and 5th level for _breath of life_).
