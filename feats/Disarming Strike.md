# Disarming Strike (Combat)

Your critical hits can disarm your foes.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Improved Disarm|Improved Disarm]]_, base attack bonus +9.

**Benefit:** Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can disarm your opponent, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds your opponent's CMD, you may disarm your opponent as if from the disarm combat maneuver. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

**Normal:** You must perform a disarm combat maneuver to disarm an opponent.

**Special:** You can only apply the effects of one of the following feats to a given critical hit: _[[feats/Bull Rush Strike|Bull Rush Strike]]_, _[[feats/Disarming Strike|Disarming Strike]]_, _[[feats/Repositioning Strike|Repositioning Strike]]_, _[[feats/Sundering Strike|Sundering Strike]]_, or _[[feats/Tripping Strike|Tripping Strike]]_. You may choose to use this feat after you make your confirmation roll.
