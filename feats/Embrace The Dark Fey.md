# Embrace The Dark Fey (Story)

The blood of an evil fey ancestor in your veins lends you aggressive, often _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Bloodthirsty|bloodthirsty]]_ impulses that you strive to keep under control.

**Prerequisites:** You must have an evil fey such as a quicklingB2 or redcapB2 somewhere in your family line, or you must have the Shameful Heritage background (Ultimate Campaign 40).

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Intimidate, this bonus increases to +4. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus on attack rolls made to confirm critical hits.

**Goal:** Demoralize an appropriate number of creatures using the Intimidate skill.

**Completion Benefit:** While a creature is _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ because you have demoralized it using the Intimidate skill, your attacks that deal damage to the creature also deal 1 point of _[[universal monster rules/Bleed|bleed]]_ damage. _Bleed_ damage from this ability does not stack with itself.
