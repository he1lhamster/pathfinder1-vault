# Musketeer's Daring (Combat, Panache)

The more you dare, the greater the results of your deeds.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15, derring-do deed, _[[classes/Swashbuckler|swashbuckler]]_ level 6th.

**Benefit:** If the result of your d6 roll is a natural 5 or 6 when using the derring-do deed, you can roll another d6 and add it to the Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Ride, or Swim check that the deed modifies. The number of d6s you roll is still limited to a number equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum 1), and you can roll another d6 after a natural roll of 5 or 6 only once per use of derring-do.

**Normal:** You can roll further derring-do d6s only if you roll a natural 6 on the die.
