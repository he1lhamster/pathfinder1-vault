# Scavenger's Luck

You coax better behavior out of timeworn technology.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (engineering) 1 rank

**Benefit:** When your check for using a piece of timeworn technology results in a glitch, you can roll again. You must choose to reroll before determining the specific glitch, and must take the second result, even if it's worse. When you use timeworn technology, it doesn't automatically glitch on a natural 1.
