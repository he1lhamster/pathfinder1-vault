# Jinxed Spell (Metamagic)

You can make a creature that fails its spell save suffer your jinx as well.

**Prerequisites:** Any two metamagic feats, Halfling Jinx trait.

**Benefit:** Any creature that fails its saving throw against a _[[feats/Jinxed Spell|jinxed spell]]_ also suffers the effects of your jinx. This feat has no effect on spells that do not allow a saving throw. If the spell affects an area or multiple creatures, you must select one creature to take the jinx, unless you have the _[[feats/Area Jinx|Area Jinx]]_ feat; if you have the _Area Jinx_ feat, choose a jinx burst area within the spell's area or among its targets and apply the jinx to those in the burst that failed their save. A _jinxed spell_ uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
