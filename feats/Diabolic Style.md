# Diabolic Style (Combat, Style)

You utilize combat as an opportunity to inflict humiliation upon those who provoke your attacks of opportunity.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_; _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_ or _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (unarmed strike); base attack bonus +2 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 1st.

**Benefit:** While using this style, you can make an attack of opportunity with an unarmed strike to deliver a humiliating swat to the target. If you hit the target, you inflict 1 point of nonlethal damage and the target must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) or become _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1 round.

**Special:** A _monk_ of at least 6th level with this feat can select _[[feats/Vital Strike|Vital Strike]]_ as a _monk_ bonus feat.
