# Cursed Item Detection

Your arcane prowess is so great that even cursed items fail to befuddle you.

**Prerequisites:** Spellcraft 5 ranks, ability to cast _[[spells/Detect Magic|detect magic]]_ as a spell or spell-like ability.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on checks made to _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ the properties of magic items. In addition, you need only exceed the DC of these checks by 5 in order to determine whether or not an item is cursed.

**Normal:** Unless the check made to _identify_ a cursed item exceeds the DC by 10 or more, the item's curse cannot be detected.
