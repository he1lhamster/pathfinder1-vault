# Explosive Escape (Combat)

When you break a grapple, you can send your assailants flying away from you.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, Str 13, _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_.

**Benefit:** When you succeed at a combat maneuver check to break a grapple, you can choose to throw back any enemies participating in the grapple who are up to one size category larger than you. Such foes are thrown 5 feet directly away from you and take an amount of nonlethal damage equal to that of your unarmed attack.
