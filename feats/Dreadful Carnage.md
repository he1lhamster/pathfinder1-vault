# Dreadful Carnage (Combat)

Slaying an enemy demoralizes your other nearby foes.

**Prerequisites:** Str 15, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, _[[feats/Furious Focus|Furious Focus]]_, base attack bonus +11.

**Benefit:** Whenever you reduce an enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, you can make an Intimidate check to demoralize all enemies within 30 feet as a free action. Enemies that cannot see both you and the enemy you reduced to 0 or fewer hit points are unaffected.
