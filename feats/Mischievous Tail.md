# Mischievous Tail

Your tail seems to have a mind of its own.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15, _[[feats/Grasping Tail|Grasping Tail]]_*, you must have a tail.

**Benefit:** You can use your tail for all purposes as though it were a free hand, though you cannot effectively wield weapons or shields with it (you can still carry such objects with your tail, as long as such an object could also be comfortably carried in a hand normally). In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on disarm and stealAPG combat maneuvers and Sleight of Hand checks performed using only your tail, and combat maneuvers performed this way do not provoke attacks of opportunity.
