Your maneuvers are devastating against disadvantaged foes.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_; sneak attack +3d6 or studied strike +3d6.

**Benefit:** If you have sneak attack, when you attempt a combat maneuver check against a creature that you are flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against your attack, you gain a bonus on the combat maneuver check that's equal to the number of sneak attack dice you roll. If you have the studied combat class feature, you can use studied strike on a combat maneuver check. When you do so, you gain a bonus on the combat maneuver check equal to your number of studied strike dice.
