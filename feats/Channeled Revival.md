# Channeled Revival

You can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ a large portion of your _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Channeling|channeling]]_ power to reverse death itself.

**Prerequisites:** Channel energy 6d6 (positive energy).

**Benefit:** As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can _expend_ three uses of your channel energy class feature to restore a dead creature to life as if you had cast the _[[spells/Breath Of Life|breath of life]]_ spell (Core Rulebook 251).
