# Gloomstorm (Combat, Conduit)

An inexhaustible arsenal lies in the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|Shadow]]_ Plane, waiting to be unleashed.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (planes) 4 ranks, _[[spells/Shadow Weapon|shadow weapon]]_* class feature.

**Benefit:** As a swift action, you can thin the barriers between yourself and the _Shadow_ Plane, allowing you to create _shadow_ weapons more easily. While this effect is active, you can create new _shadow_ weapons as a free action. This does not increase the number of _shadow_ weapons you can maintain at a single time. You can use this feat's benefit for a number of rounds per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These rounds need not be consecutive.
