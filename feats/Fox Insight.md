# Fox Insight (Combat)

Your foxlike movements protect you from your opponents' attempts to manipulate you.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Fox Style|Fox Style]]_.

**Benefit:** While using _Fox Style_, you can use your base attack bonus in place of your ranks in Sense Motive to determine your Sense Motive skill bonus when foes attempt to feint against you, and creatures attempting to demoralize you don't gain a bonus for being bigger than you (though they still take a penalty for being smaller). If your Intelligence score is at least 19, the DC to demoralize or feint you increases by 4.
