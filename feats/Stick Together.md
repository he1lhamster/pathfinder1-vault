# Stick Together (Combat, Teamwork)

You stick close to your allies in combat.

**Benefit:** When an adjacent ally with this feat moves, you can move up to your speed as an immediate action, as long as your movement ends adjacent to that ally. If you do so, you are _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ on your next turn. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.
