# Greater Weapon Of The Chosen (Combat)

Your deity guides your hand when you fight with her favored weapon.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Weapon Of The Chosen|Improved Weapon of the Chosen]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ with deity's favored weapon, _[[feats/Weapon Of The Chosen|Weapon of the Chosen]]_, must worship and receive spells from a deity.

**Benefit:** When you use your deity's favored weapon to attempt a single attack with the attack action, you roll two dice for your attack roll and take the higher result. You do not need to use your _Weapon of the Chosen_ feat to gain this feat's benefit. As usual, the reroll does not apply to any confirmation rolls.
