# Mounted Archery (Combat)

You are skilled at making ranged attacks while mounted.

**Prerequisites:** Ride 1 rank, _[[feats/Mounted Combat|Mounted Combat]]_.

**Benefit:** The penalty you take when using a ranged weapon while mounted is halved: -2 instead of -4 if your _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_ is taking a double move, and -4 instead of -8 if your _mount_ is running.
