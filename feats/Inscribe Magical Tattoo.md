# Inscribe Magical Tattoo (Item Creation)

You can craft magical tattoos.

**Prerequisites:** Craft (calligraphy, paintings, or tattoos) 5 ranks, caster level 5th.

**Benefit:** You can create magical tattoos, magic items inked directly into the flesh of a willing or _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ creature. Both you and the recipient of the _[[items/Mundane/Tattoo|tattoo]]_ (if the recipient is not yourself) must be present during the entire tattooing process. Magic tattoos must be placed on a part of the body normally able to hold a magic item slot, but they do not count against or interfere with magic items worn on those slots. A single slot can only hold one magical _tattoo_ (nonmagical tattoos and tattoos acquired from the tattooed _[[classes/Sorcerer|sorcerer]]_ archetype do not count against this limit). Tattoos may be inscribed on the following slots: belt, body, chest, feet, hands, head, neck, shoulder, ring (up to two), or wrist. They cannot be inscribed on armor, eye, headband, or _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ slots. Magical tattoos are difficult to destroy, though they count as magic items for the purposes of _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_. The spell _[[spells/Erase|erase]]_ can permanently destroy a magical _tattoo_, but the bearer of the _tattoo_ can resist the spell with a Will save, in addition to the caster needing to make a successful caster level check to _erase_ the _tattoo_. Physically removing a magical _tattoo_ with a sharp instrument or defacing it with fire or acid can destroy it as well. Doing so is a full-round action that not only requires the target to be willing or _helpless_, but also provokes attacks of opportunity. At least 2 points of damage per caster level of the _tattoo_ must be dealt to destroy a magical _tattoo_ in this manner. Magical tattoos follow the rules for magic item creation as though they were wondrous items, except that they can use the Craft (calligraphy, paintings, tattoos) skill. New magical tattoos can be researched and designed using the guidelines for pricing new magic items. Magical tattoos are treated as slotless magical items for pricing purposes.
