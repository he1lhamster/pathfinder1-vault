# Awe-Inspiring Smash (Combat, Performance)

Your fury in combat translates into crowd-pleasing displays.

**Prerequisites:** Str 15, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, base attack bonus +3.

**Benefit:** You can apply your Strength modifier instead of your Charisma modifier to performance combat checks. In addition, when you spend a swift action to attempt a performance combat check that was triggered by a successful bull rush or sunder combat maneuver check, you gain a +2 bonus on the performance combat check. For every 5 points by which your attack exceeded your opponent's CMD, this bonus increases by 2.
