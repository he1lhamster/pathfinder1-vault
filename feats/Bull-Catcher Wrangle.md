# Bull-Catcher Wrangle (Combat)

You can wrestle a charging foe to the ground.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Bull-Catcher Style|Bull-Catcher Style]]_, _[[feats/Bull-Catcher Toss|Bull-Catcher Toss]]_, _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_; base attack bonus +12, brawlerACG level 8th, or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 8th.

**Benefit:** When a creature is charging you, and you successfully grapple it with the _Bull-Catcher Style_ feat, you can immediately move it as per the _Bull-Catcher Toss_ feat. Once the creature is moved, you can break your grapple as an immediate action. If you do, select another creature in the repositioned target's threatened area. That creature becomes the new target of the initial charge attack.
