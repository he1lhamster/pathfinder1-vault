# Shield Wall (Combat,Teamwork)

You form a unified defense with those around you.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Shield Proficiency|Shield Proficiency]]_.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are wielding a _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ and are adjacent to an ally wielding a _shield_ who also has this feat, the AC bonus from your _shield_ increases, depending on the _shield_ wielded by your ally. If your ally is wielding a _[[items/Armor/Buckler|buckler]]_ or a light _shield_, your _shield_ bonus increases by +1. If your ally is wielding a heavy _shield_ or a _[[items/Shield/Tower shield|tower shield]]_, your _shield_ bonus increases by +2. You keep these bonuses even if your ally loses his _shield_ bonus due to making a _shield_ bash attack. If an adjacent ally with this feat uses a _tower shield_ to grant total cover, you also benefit if an attack targeting you passes through the edge of the _shield_ (Core Rulebook 153).
