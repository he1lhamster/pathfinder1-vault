# Furious Spell (Metamagic)

Your spells seethe with the ferocious intensity of your blood-red _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_.

**Benefit:** A _[[feats/Furious Spell|furious spell]]_ that deals hit point damage adds twice the spell's original level to the amount of damage dealt by the spell. Spells that affect multiple targets deal the extra damage once to each target, regardless of whether the spell deals its damage all at once or in multiple hits (in the latter case, add the extra damage to the first hit against each target). In addition, a _furious spell_ can be cast while the caster is enraged, including during a _[[classes/Barbarian|barbarian]]_ _rage_ or while affected by a _rage_ spell. Even a _furious spell_ that requires an emotion component can be cast while enraged. The caster gains a +2 circumstance bonus on concentration checks and caster level checks related to casting a _furious spell_ if she is enraged. A _furious spell_ uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.
