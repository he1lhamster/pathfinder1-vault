# Evolved Companion

Your animal companion has unique abilities.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, animal companion class feature.

**Benefit:** When you take this feat, select a 1-point evolution other than _[[universal monster rules/Pounce|pounce]]_ or reach from those available to a _[[classes/Summoner|summoner]]_'s eidolon. Your animal companion gains this evolution. The animal companion must conform to any limitations of the evolution. For instance, you can give the _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_ evolution only to an animal companion of an appropriate size and base form. If you gain a new animal companion, your old animal companion loses this evolution, and you can select a new 1-point evolution for the new animal companion.

**Special:** You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, select an additional 1-point evolution for your animal companion.
