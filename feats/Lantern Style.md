# Lantern Style (Combat, Style)

Your thrown weapons shine with a divine light that dazzles their targets.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Point-Blank Shot|Point-Blank Shot]]_, good or lawful alignment, caster level 1st or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 1st.

**Benefit:** Your thrown weapons glow with holy light, illuminating a 20-foot-radius area where they fall for 1 round. A target damaged by one of these weapons becomes _[[conditions/Dazzled|dazzled]]_ for 1 round.
