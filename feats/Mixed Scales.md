# Mixed Scales

You have two colors of scales, which mark you as special.

**Prerequisites:** Draconic AspectARG or dragon-scaled racial traitARG, _[[monsters/Kobold|kobold]]_.

**Benefit:** Choose an additional color for your _[[feats/Draconic Aspect|Draconic Aspect]]_ feat or dragon-scaled racial trait. You gain the benefits of both this color and the color you originally chose. (If you have both _Draconic Aspect_ and dragon-scaled, this benefit applies to both.) If you gain abilities that rely on scale color, choose which color gains the benefits.
