# Twilight Tattoo

You have a special _[[items/Mundane/Tattoo|tattoo]]_ that identifies you as a Twilight Talon when you speak a designated command word.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 13, affiliated with the Twilight Talons.

**Benefit:** You gain an _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ magical _tattoo_ that identifies you as a member of the Twilight Talons. When you speak the _command_ word, the _tattoo_ becomes visible for 1 round before fading again. The _tattoo_ has no magical aura when not visible and is not an illusion; it can't be observed through magical means. (The _command_ word causes the _tattoo_ to manifest rather than ending the magic concealing it.) Additionally, you gain a +2 bonus on Disguise checks, on Sleight of Hand checks to hide small objects on your person, and on Will saving throws against attempts to scry upon you or read your mind.
