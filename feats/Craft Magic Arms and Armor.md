# Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Item Creation)

You can create magic armor, shields, and weapons.

**Prerequisites:** Caster level 5th.

**Benefit:** You can create magic weapons, armor, or shields. Enhancing a weapon, suit of armor, or _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in the price of its magical features. To enhance a weapon, suit of armor, or _shield_, you must use up raw materials costing half of this total price. See the magic item creation rules in Chapter 15 for more information. The weapon, armor, or _shield_ to be enhanced must be a masterwork item that you provide. Its cost is not included in the above cost. You can also mend a _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ or destroyed _[[spells/Magic Weapon|magic weapon]]_, suit of armor, or _shield_ if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the raw materials and half the time it would take to craft that item in the first place.
