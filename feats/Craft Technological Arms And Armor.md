# Craft Technological Arms And Armor

You can build technological weapons and armor.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Technologist|Technologist]]_, Craft (mechanical) 7 ranks, Knowledge (engineering) 7 ranks

**Benefit:** You can create technological weapons or armor. Creating a technological weapon or suit of armor takes 1 day for every 1,000 gp in the item's price. To create the object, you must use up raw materials costing half of this total price. See Crafting High-Tech Items on page 16 for more information. You can also repair a _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ technological weapon or suit of armor if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the raw materials and half the time it would take to craft that item from scratch.
