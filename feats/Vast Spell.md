# Vast Spell (Metamagic)

Your spells cover targets across a larger area.

**Prerequisites:** Caster level 3rd.

**Benefit:** You can alter a spell that targets a number of creatures no more than 30 feet apart, such as _[[spells/Haste|haste]]_. The maximum distance apart of those you target with the spell increases to 60 feet. A _[[feats/Vast Spell|vast spell]]_ uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.
