# Raging Brute

You are able to harness the _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ that burns inside you and fuels your might.

**Prerequisites:** Str 21, _[[monsters/Ogre|ogre]]_.

**Benefit:** Select one _rage_ power. Once per day as a free action, you can enter a state of fury and gain the effects of this _rage_ power for 1 minute. If the _rage_ power normally ends a _[[classes/Barbarian|barbarian]]_ _rage_ when used, the ability ends after it's used and you immediately become _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_. You don't otherwise become _fatigued_ at the end of this ability's duration. Your effective _barbarian_ level for the purpose of qualifying for and using _rage_ powers is equal to your total Hit Dice - 3. This feat doesn't grant any of the normal benefits or penalties of a _barbarian_'s _rage_.

**Special:** You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, choose another _rage_ power and gain one additional use per day of this feat. Each time you activate this feat, you can use any or all of your _rage_ powers gained from this feat.
