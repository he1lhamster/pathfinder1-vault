# Stalker's Focus

Your affinity to the natural world allows you to adopt the focus of a single animal.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (nature) 3 ranks, Survival 3 ranks, no levels in a class that has the animal focus class feature.

**Benefit:** Choose a single type of animal to emulate from the _[[classes/Hunter|hunter]]_'s animal focus class feature. Once per day, you or your animal companion (if you have one) can gain the benefit of that animal focus for 1 minute. Treat your character level as your _hunter_ level for the purpose of determining the benefits granted by your chosen animal focus.

**Special:** If you gain levels in a class that has the animal focus class feature, when you gain that feature you gain 1 additional minute of use each day of your animal focus class feature.
