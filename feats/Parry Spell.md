# Parry Spell

You can throw an enemy spell back at its caster.

**Prerequisites:** Spellcraft 15 ranks, _[[feats/Improved Counterspell|Improved Counterspell]]_.

**Benefit:** Whenever you successfully counter a spell, it returns back to its caster. This works exactly like the _[[spells/Spell Turning|spell turning]]_ spell (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook page 347).
