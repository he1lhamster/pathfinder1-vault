# Crane Wing (Combat)

You move with the speed and finesse of an avian _[[classes/Hunter|hunter]]_, your sweeping blocks and graceful motions allowing you to deflect melee attacks with ease.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Crane Style|Crane Style]]_, _[[feats/Dodge|Dodge]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +5 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 5th.

**Benefit:** When fighting defensively with at least one hand free, you gain a +4 _dodge_ bonus to AC against melee attacks. If a melee attack misses you by 4 or less, you lose this _dodge_ bonus until the beginning of your next turn. If you are using the total defense action instead, you can deflect one melee attack that would normally hit you. An attack so deflected deals no damage and has no other effect (instead treat it as a miss). You do not _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ an action when using this feat, but you must be aware of the attack and not _[[conditions/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]_.
