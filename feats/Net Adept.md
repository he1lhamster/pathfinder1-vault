# Net Adept (Combat)

You have trained to use the _[[items/Mundane/Net|net]]_ as a melee weapon.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Exotic Weapon Proficiency|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]]_ (_net_), base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** You can treat a _net_ as a one-handed melee reach weapon with a 10-foot reach. Further, you take no penalty on melee attack rolls for using an unfolded _net_, and you can use one full-round action or two move actions to fold a _net_.

**Normal:** A _net_ is a ranged weapon that imposes a -4 penalty on ranged attack rolls if it is unfolded. _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Folding|Folding]]_ a _net_ takes a proficient user 2 rounds.
