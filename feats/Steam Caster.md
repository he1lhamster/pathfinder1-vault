# Steam Caster

You imbue your fire spells with elemental water, transforming them into powerful gouts of steam.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Undine|Undine]]_.

**Benefit:** You may increase the casting time of a fire spell to a full-round action, infusing it with elemental power (spells with a casting time of 1 full-round action or longer do not have an increased casting time). The spell is treated as if it had the water descriptor. All fire effects of the altered spell instead manifest as superheated steam. The altered spell works normally _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_ without requiring a caster level check. Unlike fire, the steam cannot ignite objects or set creatures on fire. As the spell still deals fire damage, fire _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ or _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ still applies to the spell's effects.
