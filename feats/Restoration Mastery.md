# Restoration Mastery (Item Mastery)

You can _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ more than just injuries of the flesh.

**Prerequisites:** _Heal_ 5 ranks, Use Magic Device 5 ranks, base Fortitude saving throw bonus +3.

**Benefit:** You can cause an item that has a conjuration (healing) spell of 2nd level or higher listed in its construction requirements to cast lesser _[[spells/Restoration|restoration]]_. If you have 9 ranks in both _Heal_ and Use Magic Device, you can instead cause an item that has a conjuration (healing) spell of 3rd level or higher listed in its construction requirements to cast either remove blindness/deafness or _[[spells/Remove Paralysis|remove paralysis]]_. You can use this feat once per day, plus an additional time per day when your base Fortitude save bonus reaches +9 and +12.
