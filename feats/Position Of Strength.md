# Position Of Strength (Combat)

You know how to press your advantage when negotiating with noncombatants.

**Prerequisites:** Intimidate 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** As long as you are wielding one or more weapons with which you are proficient, you gain a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks against unarmed creatures, which doesn't stack with _[[feats/Intimidating Prowess|Intimidating Prowess]]_. Additionally, if you successfully use Intimidate to demoralize an unarmed creature, that creature becomes _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for as long as you continue to be armed and they continue not to be, to a maximum of 1 minute. Creatures with _[[universal monster rules/Natural Attacks|natural attacks]]_, or whose unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, are considered to be armed for the purposes of this feat.
