# Felling Smash (Combat)

You commit all your focus to a devastating blow, trying to crush your opponent to the ground.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, Str 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Improved Trip|Improved Trip]]_, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** If you use the attack action to make a single melee attack at your highest base attack bonus while using _Power Attack_ and you hit an opponent, you can spend a swift action to attempt a _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ combat maneuver against that opponent.
