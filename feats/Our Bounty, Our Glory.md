# Our Bounty, Our Glory (Story)

You can ignore privation and channel your emotions to prepare for a later bounty.

**Prerequisites:** Be a member of House Denzarni, or have the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Bloodthirsty|Bloodthirsty]]_, Omen, Tree Tender, or Unsuspecting Master background.

**Benefit:** You add 1 day to the time you can go without food or water before making Constitution checks and you add +4 to Constitution checks to stave off the effects of starvation and thirst.

**Goal:** You must succumb to your emotions and be victorious. Thwart an appropriate number of foes while you are subject to an effect with the emotionUM descriptor, such as _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_.

**Completion Benefit:** Once per day, you can use _[[spells/Heroes' Feast|heroes' feast]]_ as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your character level, although your feast does not grant the effects of _[[spells/Neutralize Poison|neutralize poison]]_ or _[[spells/Remove Disease|remove disease]]_.
