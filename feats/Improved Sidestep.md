# Improved Sidestep (Combat)

You are adept at sidestepping your opponent's melee attacks without compromising your _[[feats/Mobility|mobility]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15, _[[feats/Dodge|Dodge]]_, _Mobility_, _[[feats/Sidestep|Sidestep]]_.

**Benefit:** After sidestepping an opponent's missed attack using the _Sidestep_ feat, you may still take a 5-foot step during your next turn, or you may move up to your full speed if you take an action to move during your next turn.

**Normal:** If you use the _Sidestep_ feat, you cannot take a 5-foot step during your next turn.
