# Obscuring Beacon (Combat)

You use light to disrupt your foes' darkness-adapted _[[spells/Vision|vision]]_.

**Benefit:** When you're holding a light source in an area that is otherwise dim or darker, foes within the normal or bright light radius shed by your light source take a -1 penalty on attack rolls against other targets that are also within the radius of your light. Blind creatures aren't affected by this feat.
