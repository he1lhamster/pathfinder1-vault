# Craft Construct (Item Creation)

You can create construct creatures like golems.

**Prerequisites:** Caster level 5th, _[[feats/Craft Magic Arms and Armor|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]]_, _[[feats/Craft Wondrous Item|Craft Wondrous Item]]_.

**Benefit:** You can create any construct whose prerequisites you meet. The act of animating a construct takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its market price. To create a construct, you must use up raw materials costing half of its base price, plus the full cost of the basic body created for the construct. Each construct has a special section that summarizes its costs and other prerequisites. A newly created construct has average hit points for its Hit Dice.
