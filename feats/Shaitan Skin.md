# Shaitan Skin (Combat)

You can manipulate acid to _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ yourself and disable your enemies.

**Prerequisites:** Con 15, Wis 15, _[[feats/Elemental Fist|Elemental Fist]]_**, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Shaitan Style|Shaitan Style]]_, base attack bonus +11 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 9th.

**Benefit:** You gain one additional _Elemental Fist_ (Advanced Player's Guide 158) attempt per day. While using the _Shaitan Style_ feat, you gain acid _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ equal to your base attack bonus, or your _monk_ level plus BAB gained from levels in classes other than _monk_, whichever is higher. While denied your Dexterity bonus to AC you are also denied this _resistance_. Creatures that take acid damage from your _Elemental Fist_ attack must succeed at a Ref lex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) or be _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1 round.
