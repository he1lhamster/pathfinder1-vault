# Expansive Trap Ability

Your _[[classes/Ranger|ranger]]_ traps and land mines occupy a larger area.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to use _ranger_ traps (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 64) or land mines (Pathfinder Player Companion: Dungeoneer's Handbook 23).

**Benefit:** You can designate any _ranger_ trap or land mine you lay to occupy up to 4 contiguous squares of your choice. When the trap is activated, the effect is centered on whichever square the triggering creature first entered. If more than one square is entered simultaneously, choose at random.
