# Divert Harm (Combat)

You know how to throw your enemies into _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_'s way at the last second.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, base attack bonus +6, evasion class feature.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are the target of an areaof- effect attack that normally deals half damage on a successful Reflex save (such as a _[[spells/Fireball|fireball]]_ spell or _[[spells/Dragon's Breath|dragon's breath]]_ weapon), you may, as an immediate action, wrestle an adjacent foe into _harm_'s way. This does not alter the position of you or your opponent, but your opponent must attempt a Reflex save against the attack in your place. If your opponent fails, it takes half damage from the attack and you take none; if it succeeds, it takes no damage and you take damage as normal as though you'd failed your saving throw (though this damage is still reduced by abilities such as improved evasion). This feat works even if the opponent was already in the affected area of the attack (so it is possible that an unlucky opponent could take as much as 1-1/2 times the damage normally possible from the attack). You can use this ability only on a foe within one size category of yourself.
