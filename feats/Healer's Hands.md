# Healer's Hands (Conduit)

Your healing efforts are bolstered by positive energy.

**Prerequisites:** _[[spells/Heal|Heal]]_ 1 rank, Knowledge (planes) 1 rank.

**Benefit:** You can use the _Heal_ skill to treat _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ wounds as a full-round action. You do not take a penalty for not using a _[[items/Mundane/Healer's kit|healer's kit]]_ when treating _deadly_ wounds this way, and you can do so on a given creature more than once per day. When treating _deadly_ wounds this way, if your result exceeds the DC by 10 or more, add your ranks in Knowledge (planes) to the damage healed. These benefits do not apply to creatures that are not healed by positive energy. You can use this feat's benefit a number of times per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes).
