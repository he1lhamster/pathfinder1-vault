# Monstrous Mount Mastery

Your _[[feats/Monstrous Mount|monstrous mount]]_ has developed an ability that only its wild kin would normally possess.

**Prerequisites:** _Monstrous Mount_, character level equal to or higher than that listed in your _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_'s Mastery entry.

**Benefit:** Your _monstrous mount_ gains the abilities and bonuses listed under Mastery in its stat block. You must be of at least the indicated level for the _mount_ to use these abilities, so if you dismiss a _mount_ and gain a new _mount_ of a different type, you retain the feat but might not yet be of sufficient level for the new _mount_ to gain its Mastery benefits.

**Normal:** A _monstrous mount_ is unable to use its Mastery abilities regardless of its advancement.
