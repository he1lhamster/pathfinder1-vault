# Derro Magister

A _[[feats/Derro Magister|derro magister]]_'s mind is particularly affected by the _[[feats/Consumption|consumption]]_ of strange mold, granting enhanced _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ to magic and additional _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ and traits.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 20, _[[monsters/Derro|derro]]_

**Benefit:** A _derro magister_'s _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ equals the _derro_'s Hit Dice +10. _[[spells/Heal|Heal]]_ is always a class skill for a _derro magister_, and it gains a +4 racial bonus on all _Heal_ checks. A _derro_ with this feat treats its caster level for all _spell-like abilities_ as equal to his Hit Dice. In addition, as soon as a _derro_ with this feat achieves a total of 6 Hit Dice by gaining enough levels in any combination of classes, it gains the use of additional _spell-like abilities_ as detailed below. At will-levitate 1/day-deeper slumber, _[[spells/Modify Memory|modify memory]]_
