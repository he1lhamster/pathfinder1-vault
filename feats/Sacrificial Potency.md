# Sacrificial Potency

Your powers wax with the deaths of mortals.

**Prerequisites:** One or more racial _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_, outsider with the evil subtype.

**Benefit:** Whenever you perform a coup de _[[spells/Grace|grace]]_ that kills a creature, choose a racial spell-like ability you have that is usable a limited number of times per day (but not more limited, such as once per week or once per month). The spell-like ability's spell level must be equal to or less than half the victim's Hit Dice. You regain a use of that spell-like ability. This has no effect if you haven't expended any uses of that spell-like ability. In addition, you can gain this benefit when an ally within 30 feet performs a coup de _grace_ that kills its victim. The ally must openly proclaim that the killing is done in your name. This otherwise acts as if you had performed the coup de _grace_ yourself. You can gain this feat's benefit only once every 24 hours.
