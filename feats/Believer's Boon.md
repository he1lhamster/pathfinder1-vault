# Believer's Boon

Your deity rewards you for your faithfulness.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 13, alignment must be within one step of your deity's.

**Benefit:** Choose one domain granted by your deity. Once per day, you can use all 1st-level domain abilities granted to clerics of that domain. You gain access to this one ability only, not the higher-level domain ability, domain spells, or additional class skills that the domain might grant, or any bonus feats that are listed under its granted powers. Your effective _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ level in regard to this ability is 1st level.

**Special:** You can take this feat twice. When you take it a second time, you choose another domain granted by your deity. If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity, your alignment shifts so that it is more than one step away from your deity's, or you no longer worship your deity, you lose access to this feat. You can regain it once you atone for your misdeeds to your deity (see the _[[spells/Atonement|atonement]]_ spell on page 245 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).
