# Putrid Summons

You _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ creatures whose very presence turns the stomach of your foes.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Spell Focus|Spell Focus]]_ (conjuration); ability to cast _summon_ monster or _summon_ nature's ally.

**Benefit:** When you cast a _summon_ monster or _summon_ nature's ally spell, you can choose to _summon_ a single creature that exudes a _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Putrid|putrid]]_ odor or befouls the water surrounding it, granting it the _[[universal monster rules/Stench|stench]]_ universal monster ability. The duration of the _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ condition created by this _stench_ is a number of rounds equal to the spell's level. When performing a _putrid_ _summon_, you _summon_ a creature from the next lower list than the spell you are casting. For instance, if you cast _[[spells/Summon Monster IV|summon monster IV]]_, you _summon_ a creature from the _[[spells/Summon Monster III|summon monster III]]_ list.
