# Rending Swarm (Combat, Teamwork)

Together, you and your allies tear through enemies' defenses.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15, _[[feats/Rat Stack|Rat Stack]]_, swarming racial trait.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on all melee damage rolls for each allied creature you share a square with that also has this feat. If two or more allies sharing a square have this feat and hit the same adjacent creature in a round, they tear it in different directions, dealing additional damage at the end of the round. This _[[universal monster rules/Rend|rend]]_ attack deals an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + the highest Strength modifier of all qualifying allies in the same square who struck the target this round.
