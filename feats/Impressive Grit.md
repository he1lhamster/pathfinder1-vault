# Impressive Grit (Weapon Mastery)

Your mastery of ranged weapons allows you to perform impressive deeds.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +11, weapon _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ class feature with a ranged weapon.

**Benefit:** Select one of the following _[[classes/Gunslinger|gunslinger]]_ deedsUC: dead shot, startling shot, or targeting. You can perform the selected deed a number of times per day equal to your highest mental ability score modifier (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma; minimum 1). You can use this deed with an appropriate ranged weapon. If you also have the selected deed as a class feature, reduce the number of grit points that you need to use it by 1, as per the Signature DeedUC feat.

**Special:** You can select _[[feats/Impressive Grit|Impressive Grit]]_ up to three times. Each time you select it, choose a different _gunslinger_ deed. A gunslingerUC can ignore the weapon _training_ class feature prerequisite of _Impressive Grit_.
