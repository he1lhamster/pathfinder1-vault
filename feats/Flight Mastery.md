# Flight Mastery (Item Mastery)

You can coax the magic of _[[universal monster rules/Flight|flight]]_ from transmutation magic items.

**Prerequisites:** Use Magic Device 3 ranks, base Fortitude save bonus +6.

**Benefit:** You can cause an item that has a transmutation spell of 2nd level or higher listed in its construction requirements to cast fly. If the item is a suit of armor you are wearing, you can use the item's enhancement bonus in place of your Dexterity modifier on Fly skill checks while the spell lasts. You can use this feat once per day, plus an additional time per day at base Fortitude save bonus +9 and +12.
