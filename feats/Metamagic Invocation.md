# Metamagic Invocation

You have further refined your combination of elemental power and spellcasting with metamagic techniques.

**Prerequisites:** Metakinesis class feature.

**Benefit:** Choose a metamagic feat from the following list: _[[feats/Enlarge Spell|Enlarge Spell]]_, _[[feats/Extend Spell|Extend Spell]]_, Intuitive SpellOA, Logical SpellOA, _[[feats/Quicken Spell|Quicken Spell]]_, Reach SpellAPG, or Tenacious SpellUI. When casting a spell via _[[feats/Kinetic Invocation|Kinetic Invocation]]_, you can increase its _[[universal monster rules/Burn|burn]]_ cost to augment the spell with that metamagic feat. The _burn_ cost increase is equal to the spell level increase applied by the feat. Augmenting a spell increases its casting time as if it were cast spontaneously.

**Special:** You can take this feat more than once. Each time you take this feat, select another metamagic feat; you can augment a spell with multiple feats by accepting additional points of _burn_ equal to the total increased spell level.
