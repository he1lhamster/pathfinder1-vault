# Equipment Trick (Combat)

Choose one piece of equipment, such as boots, a cloak, rope, a _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_, or a heavy blade scabbard. You understand how to use that item in combat.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** You may use any equipment tricks relating to the item if you meet the appropriate trick requirements. If the item would normally be considered an improvised weapon, you may treat it as a normal weapon or an improvised weapon, whichever is more beneficial for you.

**Special:** You can gain the _[[feats/Equipment Trick|Equipment Trick]]_ feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of equipment.
