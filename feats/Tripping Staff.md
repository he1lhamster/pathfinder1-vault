# Tripping Staff (Combat)

You can make a _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ attack with your _[[items/Weapon/Quarterstaff|quarterstaff]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Improved Trip|Improved Trip]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_quarterstaff_), base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** You treat quarterstaves as if they had the _trip_ special feature.

**Special:** If you are a _[[classes/Magus|magus]]_ with the staff _magus_ archetype, you can use spellstrike on any _trip_ combat maneuver you make with the staff.
