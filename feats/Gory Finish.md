# Gory Finish (Combat)

By drawing upon wells of savagery, you can slay your foe in creative and horrifyingly gruesome manners, intimidating nearby foes.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Dazzling Display|Dazzling Display]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_.

**Benefit:** When you use the attack action, you can use a weapon with which you have _Weapon Focus_ to make a single attack at your highest base attack bonus. If you reduce your target to negative hit points, you can spend a swift action to make an Intimidate check to demoralize all foes within 30 feet who could see your attack.
