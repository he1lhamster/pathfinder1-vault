# Blind-Fight (Combat)

You are skilled at attacking opponents that you cannot clearly perceive.

**Benefit:** In melee, every time you miss because of concealment (see Chapter 8), you can reroll your miss chance percentile roll one time to see if you actually hit. An _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you in melee. That is, you don't lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn't get the usual +2 bonus for being _invisible_. The _invisible_ attacker's bonuses do still apply for ranged attacks, however. You do not need to make Acrobatics skill checks to move at full speed while _[[conditions/Blinded|blinded]]_.

**Normal:** Regular attack roll modifiers for _invisible_ attackers trying to hit you apply, and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC. The speed reduction for _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_ and poor visibility also applies.

**Special:** The _[[feats/Blind-Fight|Blind-Fight]]_ feat is of no use against a character who is the subject of a _[[spells/Blink|blink]]_ spell.
