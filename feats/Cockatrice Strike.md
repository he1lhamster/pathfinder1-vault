# Cockatrice Strike (Combat)

With a single strike, you transmute _[[spells/Flesh to Stone|flesh to stone]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Gorgon's Fist|Gorgon's Fist]]_, _[[feats/Medusa's Wrath|Medusa's Wrath]]_, base attack bonus +14.

**Benefit:** As a full-round action, you can make a single unarmed strike against a _[[conditions/Dazed|dazed]]_, _[[conditions/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]_, _[[conditions/Paralyzed|paralyzed]]_, _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_, _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_, or _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_ foe. If that attack is a critical hit, the target is _[[conditions/Petrified|petrified]]_ unless it succeeds on a Fortitude saving throw with a DC of 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier. This is a supernatural _[[spells/Polymorph|polymorph]]_ effect.
