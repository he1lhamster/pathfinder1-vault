# Diabolical Negotiator

You treat the art of negotiation as devilish science.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Skill Focus|Skill Focus]]_ (Diplomacy), worshiper of Asmodeus.

**Benefit:** You can add your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (whichever is higher) on Diplomacy checks in place of your Charisma modifier. You can shift a creature's attitude more than two steps with Diplomacy, and a creature's attitude is only decreased by one step if you roll a natural 1 and fail the check by 5 or more.
