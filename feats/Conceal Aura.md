# Conceal Aura

You can weaken your alignment aura to hide the true extent of your faith.

**Prerequisites:** Chaotic, evil, good, or lawful alignment.

**Benefit:** As a full-round action, you can reduce the power of the aura generated by your alignment for 1 minute. During this time, for the purposes of spells that detect alignment, your aura's power is lessened by one step (for example, if you are a 12th-level neutral good _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_, your aura power is faint rather than moderate). You also gain a +2 bonus on Bluff checks to send secret messages.
