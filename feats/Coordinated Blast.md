# Coordinated Blast (Teamwork)

With trained precision, you create safe pockets within the areas of your spells, inside which your allies remain safe.

**Prerequisites:** Spellcraft 5 ranks, any racial spell-like ability.

**Benefit:** Whenever you use a spell or ability with an area (such as _[[spells/Fireball|fireball]]_ or channel energy), you can exclude any number of allies who also have this feat from that area of effect.
