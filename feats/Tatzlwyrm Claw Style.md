# Tatzlwyrm Claw Style (Combat, Style)

Your curled fingers can tear into opponents' flesh and _[[feats/Snatch|snatch]]_ free _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ allies.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, Escape Artist 1 rank.

**Benefit:** You can choose for your unarmed attacks to deal slashing damage. If you strike a target that has another creature _grappled_ or _[[conditions/Pinned|pinned]]_, as a swift action you can immediately attempt a grapple combat maneuver check against the target's CMD. If you succeed at the check, you can force the target to release a _grappled_ creature or switch a _pinned_ creature to being merely _grappled_.
