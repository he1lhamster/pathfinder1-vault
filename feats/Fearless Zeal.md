# Fearless Zeal (Story)

You're willing to lay down your life for your faith.

**Prerequisites:** You must be ordained as a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sacred|sacred]]_ (or profane) _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Champion|champion]]_ of your faith by a high-ranking member of its clergy, or have the Devoted, Faith-Bringer, or Moral Debt background. Such an honor goes above and beyond the normal oaths required of a _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ or _[[classes/Paladin|paladin]]_.

**Benefit:** Once per day, you can add a +2 bonus on any single attack roll, caster level check, saving throw, or skill check. You must choose to add this bonus after the die has been rolled and success or failure determined, but before any results (such as damage) are rolled and applied. If you have 10 or more levels or hit dice, this bonus increases to +4.

**Goal:** Die in pursuit of your faith's goals and be brought back to life. If you die in circumstances that don't involve your faith, you gain no benefit. If your GM permits, you can instead remain dead and create a new PC _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Inspired|inspired]]_ by your heroic _[[spells/Sacrifice|sacrifice]]_.

**Completion Benefit:** If you died and came back, you become a living symbol of faith. Once per day as a standard action, you can inspire those who share your faith to great effort, granting them a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and saving throws for 1 minute. This is a mind-affecting, language-dependent effect. If you create a new character _inspired_ by your previous character, the new PC receives a +2 bonus to a single ability score. This ability score can't be one that already has a racial bonus. The new PC can later take this feat if he meets the prerequisite.
