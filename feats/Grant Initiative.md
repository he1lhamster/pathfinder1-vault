# Grant Initiative

Not only are you a master at taking the initiative, but you can also grant it to someone else.

**Prerequisites:** _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cunning|Cunning]]_ initiative class feature.

**Benefit:** At the start of each encounter, you can either choose to keep the bonus granted to you by your Wisdom modifier on initiative checks or choose to give that bonus to one of your allies that you can see. You must make this choice before you or the ally you are granting the bonus to makes the initiative check.
