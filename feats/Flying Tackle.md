# Flying Tackle

You quickly bring down an off-balanced opponent.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Overrun|Improved Overrun]]_.

**Benefit:** When attempting an overrun combat maneuver check against a _[[conditions/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]_ opponent, if the attempt knocks the creature _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_, you can also fall _prone_ in order to attempt a grapple combat maneuver check against the creature as a free action. Doing so does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the target of your grapple.
