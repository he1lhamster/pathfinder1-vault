# Rapid Reload (Combat)

Choose a type of crossbow (hand, light, heavy) or a single type of one-handed or two-handed firearm that you are proficient with. You can reload such a weapon quickly.

**Prerequisites:** Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen) or _[[feats/Exotic Weapon Proficiency|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]]_ (firearm).

**Benefit:** The time required for you to reload your chosen type of weapon is reduced to a free action (for a hand or _[[items/Weapon/Light crossbow|light crossbow]]_), a move action (for _[[items/Weapon/Heavy crossbow|heavy crossbow]]_ or onehanded firearm), or a standard action (two-handed firearm). Reloading a crossbow or firearm still provokes attacks of opportunity. If you have selected this feat for a _[[items/Weapon/Hand crossbow|hand crossbow]]_ or _light crossbow_, you may fire that weapon as many times in a fullattack action as you could attack if you were using a bow.

**Normal:** A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a hand or _light crossbow_, a standard action to reload a one-handed firearm, or a full-round action to load a _heavy crossbow_ or a two-handed firearm.

**Special:** You can gain _[[feats/Rapid Reload|Rapid Reload]]_ multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of crossbow or a new type of firearm.
