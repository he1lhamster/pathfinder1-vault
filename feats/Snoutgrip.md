# Snoutgrip (Combat)

You can hold an opponent's mouth shut.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_, _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +12 or 10th-level _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_.

**Benefit:** As an immediate action, whenever an opponent up to one size category larger than you misses you with its bite attack, you can attempt a grapple with a -5 penalty on the check. If you succeed, you have _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ your opponent and are holding its mouth shut, preventing it from using its bite attack, _[[universal monster rules/Breath Weapon|breath weapon]]_, or spells with a verbal component until it escapes your grapple. You may make this grapple attempt even if the target is out of your reach.
