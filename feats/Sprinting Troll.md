# Sprinting Troll

You use your powerful metabolism to hunt swiftly, starving your regenerative powers in the interest of granting yourself greater speed.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Fleet|Fleet]]_, _[[universal monster rules/Regeneration|regeneration]]_, _[[monsters/Troll|troll]]_.

**Benefit:** As a free action, you can increase your land speed by 10 feet for 1 minute. You lose your _regeneration_ ability while you benefit from this enhancement bonus to your land speed and for 1 minute afterward. You can end this ability early as a free action. You can activate this ability only if your _regeneration_ is functioning.
