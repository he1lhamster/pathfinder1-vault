# Totem Beast

Your animal companion becomes spiritually connected to an animal totem that has a spiritual signif icance for you or your background, such as a Shoanti clan's animal totem.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 13, animal companion class feature.

**Benefit:** Select one _[[spells/Animal Aspect|animal aspect]]_ from the list presented in the _[[classes/Hunter|hunter]]_ class's animal focus class feature. Your animal companion has natural coloration suggestive of this aspect-a bear might have a dark spot in the shape of a bat, or a hawk might have unusual _[[monsters/Tiger|tiger]]_ striping in its feathers. Your animal companion gains the benefits of the selected _animal aspect_, treating its Hit Dice as its effective _hunter_ level for this ability. This bonus doesn't stack if the animal companion is already under the benefit of the same _animal aspect_ because of the actual class feature. For example, an animal companion with _[[feats/Totem Beast|Totem Beast]]_ (snake) under the effect of the snake aspect from its _hunter_ owner would get a +2 bonus on attack rolls when making attacks of opportunity, not a +4 bonus.
