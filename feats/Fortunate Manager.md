# Fortunate Manager

Your good luck helps you and your business persevere even during the most troublesome times.

**Prerequisites:** Own at least one building.

**Benefit:** During the Event phase of downtime, if an event occurs and the GM rolls on a building event table or organization event table (see pages 114-129 of Ultimate Campaign), you may, once per week, choose to roll twice on the applicable table and choose either result. You must declare you are using this feat before the results of the initial roll are revealed.
