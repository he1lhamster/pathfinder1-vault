# Fatiguing Stare (Combat, Stare)

Your painful stare fatigues your opponent.

**Prerequisites:** _[[classes/Mesmerist|Mesmerist]]_ level 7th, painful stare class feature.

**Benefit:** When a target takes damage from your painful stare, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your _mesmerist_ level + your Charisma modifier) or become _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_ for 1 round. This can't cause the target to become _[[conditions/Exhausted|exhausted]]_, even if the target is already _fatigued_.
