# Swift Kitsune Shapechanger

You can _[[universal monster rules/Change Shape|change shape]]_ more quickly than most _[[monsters/Kitsune|kitsune]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, base attack bonus +6, _kitsune_.

**Benefit:** You can assume human or _kitsune_ form as a swift action. If you have the _[[feats/Fox Shape|Fox Shape]]_ feat, you can assume fox form as a swift action as well.

**Normal:** A _kitsune_'s _change shape_ ability is a standard action.
