# Chain Mastery (Combat)

You wield spiked chains with effortless lethality.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15, _[[feats/Exotic Weapon Proficiency|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]]_ (_[[items/Weapon/Spiked chain|spiked chain]]_).

**Benefit:** You treat a _spiked chain_ as a one-handed martial weapon for all purposes. You can still choose to wield a _spiked chain_ as a two-handed weapon, and if you do so, you gain a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to disarm or _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ foes with your _spiked chain_.
