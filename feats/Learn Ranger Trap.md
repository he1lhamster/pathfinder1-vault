# Learn Ranger Trap

You learn how to create one kind of _[[classes/Ranger|ranger]]_ trap.

**Prerequisites:** Survival 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** Select one _ranger_ trap (see page 64). You may use this trap a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom bonus (minimum 1). The DC for your trap is equal to 10 + 1/2 your character's level + your Wisdom bonus, and it lasts 1 day per two character levels. If you are not a _ranger_, you can only set extraordinary traps with this feat; like all extraordinary _ranger_ traps, this decreases the trap DC by 2.

**Special:** A _ranger_ may use _ranger_ traps a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his _ranger_ level plus his Wisdom bonus. See the description of _ranger_ traps for durations.
