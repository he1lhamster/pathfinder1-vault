# Penetrating Stare (Combat, Stare)

Your stare penetrates right through your foe's strongest mental defenses.

**Prerequisites:** _[[classes/Mesmerist|Mesmerist]]_ level 7th, painful stare class feature.

**Benefit:** When you trigger your painful stare, the damage dealt ignores 5 points of the target's _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_, unless that _damage reduction_ is untyped (for example, DR 10/-).
