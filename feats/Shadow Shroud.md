# Shadow Shroud

Using a portion of your innate magic, you cloak your body in _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_ to evade attacks.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_, _darkness_ racial spell-like ability.

**Benefit:** As an immediate action, you can create a shifting haze of _darkness_ around yourself, granting you concealment against one attack. The haze dissipates after the attack is resolved. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day when your caster level for your racial _darkness_ spell-like ability reaches 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th.
