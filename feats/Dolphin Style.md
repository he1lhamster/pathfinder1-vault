# Dolphin Style (Combat, Style)

You fight like a _[[monsters/Dolphin|dolphin]]_, bunching your enemies up together to make it easier to pick them off.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, Swim 3 ranks, base attack bonus +3 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 3rd.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on melee attack rolls against any creature adjacent to at least two of its other allies as long as you aren't flanking that creature, and your melee attacks ignore any bonus to AC gained by use of the aid another action.
