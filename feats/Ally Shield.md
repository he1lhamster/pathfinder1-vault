# Ally Shield (Teamwork)

You are willing to use your allies as shields to ward off attacks aimed at you.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are the target of a melee or ranged attack and are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you can _[[npcs/Initiate|initiate]]_ this feat to skillfully _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ the abettor into _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_'s way or _[[feats/Dodge|dodge]]_ behind the abettor as an immediate action. You gain cover against that attack (and only that attack). If the attack misses you but would have hit you if not for the cover bonus to your Armor Class, the abettor becomes the target of the attack and the attacker must make a new attack roll (with all the same modifiers) against the abettor's Armor Class.
