**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Voracious Blade|Voracious Blade]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_rhoka sword_), base attack bonus +8, _[[monsters/Urdefhan|urdefhan]]_.

**Benefit:** When you use the _Voracious Blade_ feat to deal Strength damage with your _rhoka sword_, you also drain the victim's blood. The attack deals 1 point of _[[universal monster rules/Bleed|bleed]]_ damage in addition to its normal damage, and you gain _[[universal monster rules/Fast Healing|fast healing]]_ 2 for 3 rounds. You can use this ability only once against an individual creature in a 24-hour period.
