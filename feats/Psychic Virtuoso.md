# Psychic Virtuoso

You can use all of your occult skill unlocks more often and you are more talented at using them.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Psychic Sensitivity|Psychic Sensitivity]]_ or ability to cast _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ spells.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on checks to use occult skill unlocks. If you have more than 10 ranks in the base skill, this bonus increases to +4. This bonus doesn't apply on other checks using the base skills-only on checks for occult skill unlocks.
