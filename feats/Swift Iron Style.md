# Swift Iron Style (Combat, Style)

You have learned to move in ways that better accommodate your armor, and can maneuver easily despite its bulk.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, Dex 13, proficiency with _[[classes/Medium|medium]]_ armor.

**Benefit:** While using this style, you treat the armor check penalty of your armor as if it were 1 less, and the maximum Dexterity bonus to AC as if it were 1 higher.

**Special:** A character with the armor _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ class feature can use _[[feats/Swift Iron Style|Swift Iron Style]]_ while wearing any type of armor with which she is proficient. These benefits stack with armor _training_.
