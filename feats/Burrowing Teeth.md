# Burrowing Teeth

You have teeth and claws that suit you well to digging.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Sharpclaw|Sharpclaw]]_, _[[feats/Tunnel Rat|Tunnel Rat]]_, _[[monsters/Ratfolk|ratfolk]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain a _[[universal monster rules/Burrow|burrow]]_ speed equal to 1/2 your base speed. You can _burrow_ through sand, dirt, _[[items/Mundane/Clay|clay]]_, gravel, or similar materials, but not solid stone. You do not leave a hole behind, nor is your passage marked on the surface.
