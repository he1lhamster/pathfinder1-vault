# Victory Through Unity (Story)

You have practiced your family's genetic experimentations upon your own familiar.

**Prerequisites:** You must have a familiar, and you must either be a member of House Merrosett or have the Initiated or Storied Lineage background.

**Benefit:** When you gain this feat, choose an _[[spells/Animal Aspect|animal aspect]]_ granted by the _[[classes/Hunter|hunter]]_'s animal focus class ability (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 27) and apply it to your familiar. Your _hunter_ level for this ability is 1st, and you cannot change this ability once you have selected it. If your familiar dies, it loses its aspect and you may choose a new aspect if you take a new familiar. Your familiar's form is altered by superficial changes appropriate to its aspect.

**Goal:** You must breed a new magical creature.

**Completion Benefit:** You may either choose and apply a second _animal aspect_ to your familiar or apply an evolution from the 1-point evolutions available to a _[[classes/Summoner|summoner]]_'s eidolon (Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained 35). The familiar must conform to any limitations of the evolution (such as being one size category larger than its rider to serve as a _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_). Once selected, this decision cannot be changed, but if your familiar dies it loses these abilities and you may choose new abilities if you take a new familiar. If your familiar breeds with its original kind, it has the potential to pass on these extra abilities as permanent traits.
