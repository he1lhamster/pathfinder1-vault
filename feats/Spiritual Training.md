Through dedicated study and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_, you can resist the control of possessing spirits.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 competence bonus on Knowledge checks to _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ creatures with the _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ subtype, and can attempt Knowledge checks dealing with _incorporeal_ creatures untrained. When affected by a _[[spells/Dominate Person|dominate person]]_, _[[spells/Magic Jar|magic jar]]_, or possessionOA spell or a similar ability, your mind and soul remain aware within your body, at war with the invading consciousness. While dominated or possessed, you can attempt a Will save as a swift action to temporarily regain control over your body. On a successful save, you can act normally for 1 round. On a failed s`ave, you cannot attempt to regain control for 1 hour, but the possessing consciousness can't take a swift action that round.
