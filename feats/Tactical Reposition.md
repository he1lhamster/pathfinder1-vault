# Tactical Reposition (Combat)

You excel at moving foes right where you want them.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, Improved RepositionAPG.

**Benefit:** When making a reposition combat maneuver (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 322), you can move an enemy into a trap or other hazardous area, such as a pit, wall _[[items/Weapon/Scythe|scythe]]_, or _[[spells/Blade Barrier|blade barrier]]_. When you do so, the moved enemy is treated as though it had activated the trap or triggered the hazard, and it takes a -2 penalty to AC and on saving throws to mitigate the trap or hazard's effects.

**Normal:** You cannot reposition a foe into an intrinsically dangerous space such as a pit or _blade barrier_.
