# Eldritch Heritage

You are descended from a long line of sorcerers, and some portion of their power flows in your veins.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, _[[feats/Skill Focus|Skill Focus]]_ with the class skill of bloodline selected for this feat (see below), character level 3rd.

**Benefit:** Select one _[[classes/Sorcerer|sorcerer]]_ bloodline. You must have _Skill focus_ in the class skill that bloodline grants to a _sorcerer_ at 1st level (for example, _[[spells/Heal|Heal]]_ for the celestial bloodline). This bloodline cannot be a bloodline you already have. You gain the first-level bloodline power for the selected bloodline. For purposes of using that power, treat your _sorcerer_ level as equal to your character level - 2, even if you have levels in _sorcerer_. You do not gain any of the other bloodline abilities.
