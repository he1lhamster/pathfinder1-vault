# Thunder And Fang

You have mastered the ancient Shoanti _[[feats/Thunder And Fang|Thunder and Fang]]_ fighting style, allowing you to fight with increased effectiveness when wielding an _[[items/Weapon/Earth breaker|earth breaker]]_ and _[[items/Armor/Klar|klar]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Str 15, _[[feats/Two-Weapon Fighting|Two-Weapon Fighting]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_earth breaker_), _Weapon Focus_ (_klar_)

**Benefit:** You can use an _earth breaker_ as though it were a one-handed weapon. When using an _earth breaker_ in one hand and a _klar_ in your off hand, you retain the _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ bonus your _klar_ grants to your Armor Class even when you use it to attack. Treat your _klar_ as a light weapon for the purposes of determining your _two-weapon fighting_ penalty.

**Normal:** An _earth breaker_ is a two-handed weapon, preventing the use of a _klar_ in one hand without imposing penalties for using the _earth breaker_ one-handed. A _klar_ can be used either as a one-handed weapon or a _shield_; it does not grant a bonus to AC during rounds in which it is used as a weapon.

**Special:** This is a combat feat, and may be selected with class features that grant bonus combat feats.
