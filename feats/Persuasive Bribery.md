# Persuasive Bribery

You know how to get the most out of bribes.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Persuasive|Persuasive]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks when attempting to bribe someone and on Diplomacy or Charisma checks to bargain with a conjured creature (such as with _[[spells/Planar Ally|planar ally]]_ or _[[spells/Planar Binding|planar binding]]_), in addition to any bonus granted by the bribe itself. The first time someone refuses a bribe you offer, that person's attitude toward you doesn't worsen, even if the offer would normally offend the person.
