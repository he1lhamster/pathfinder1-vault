# Improved Familiar

This feat allows you to acquire a powerful familiar, but only when you could normally acquire a new familiar.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to acquire a new familiar, compatible alignment, sufficiently high level (see below).

**Benefit:** When choosing a familiar, the creatures listed below are also available to you (see the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary for statistics on these creatures). You may choose a familiar with an alignment up to one step away on each alignment axis (lawful through chaotic, good through evil).

<table><tbody><tr><th>Familiar</th><th>Alignment</th><th>Arcane Spellcaster Level</th></tr><tr><td>Celestial hawk1</td><td>Neutral good</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>Dire rat</td><td>Neutral</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>Fiendish viper2</td><td>Neutral evil</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>Elemental, Small (any type)</td><td>Neutral</td><td>5th</td></tr><tr><td>_[[monsters/Stirge|Stirge]]_</td><td>Neutral</td><td>5th</td></tr><tr><td>Homunculus3</td><td>Any</td><td>7th</td></tr><tr><td>Imp</td><td>Lawful evil</td><td>7th</td></tr><tr><td>_[[monsters/Mephit|Mephit]]_ (any type)</td><td>Neutral</td><td>7th</td></tr><tr><td>_[[monsters/Pseudodragon|Pseudodragon]]_</td><td>Neutral good</td><td>7th</td></tr><tr><td>Quasit</td><td>Chaotic evil</td><td>7th</td></tr><tr><td>1 Or other celestial animal from the standard familiar list.</td></tr><tr><td>2 Or other fiendish animal from the standard familiar list.</td></tr><tr><td>3 The master must first create the _[[monsters/Homunculus|homunculus]]_.</td></tr></tbody></table>

Improved familiars otherwise use the rules for regular familiars, with two exceptions: if the creature's type is something other than animal, its type does not change; and improved familiars do not gain the ability to speak with other creatures of their kind (although many of them already have the ability to communicate).
