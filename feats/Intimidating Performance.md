# Intimidating Performance

Your performance strikes _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ in the hearts of foes.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to start a performance (or raging song) as a move action, bardic performance or raging song class feature.

**Benefit:** When you start a performance (or a raging song) as a move or swift action, you can use a standard action to demoralize a foe (Core Rulebook 99), attempting a Perform check appropriate to your performance in place of the Intimidate check. Your performance must be one with an audible component. If you can start a performance as a swift action and you have the _[[feats/Dazzling Display|Dazzling Display]]_ feat, you can gain the benefit of _Dazzling Display_ by succeeding at a Perform check in place of an Intimidate check.
