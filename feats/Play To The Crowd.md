# Play To The Crowd

You can glean the interests of others and use that information to strengthen your rhetoric.

**Prerequisites:** Int 19, _[[feats/Ironclad Logic|Ironclad Logic]]_, Diplomacy 5 ranks, Sense Motive 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** When you use Diplomacy to change the attitude of a character, you can first attempt a Sense Motive check against that NPC to get a hunch to determine whether the character is under the inf luence of an enchantment, to use _[[feats/Sense Assumptions|Sense Assumptions]]_, or to determine biases for a verbal duel (see page 176). If you succeed at the Sense Motive check, you gain a +2 bonus on the Diplomacy check, and if you learned any biases for a verbal duel, you learn one additional bias of your choice. You do not worsen an NPC's attitude if you fail a Diplomacy check by 5 or more.
