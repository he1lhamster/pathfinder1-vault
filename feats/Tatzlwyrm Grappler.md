# Tatzlwyrm Grappler (Combat)

You can twist and bend in a way that makes you extremely difficult to _[[universal monster rules/Grab|grab]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Tatzlwyrm Claw Style|Tatzlwyrm Claw Style]]_, Escape Artist 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** While you're using the _[[monsters/Tatzlwyrm|Tatzlwyrm]]_ Style feat, whenever an opponent attempts to _[[npcs/Initiate|initiate]]_ a grapple against you, you can attempt an Escape Artist check. If the result is higher than your CMD, you can use the result as your CMD against that combat maneuver. You must be aware of the attack and not _[[conditions/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]_.
