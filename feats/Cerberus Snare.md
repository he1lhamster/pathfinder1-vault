# Cerberus Snare (Combat)

Your strikes latch onto your opponent like the jaws of a cerberus, preventing them from fleeing across planes.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Cerberus Crush|Cerberus Crush]]_*, base attack bonus +9 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 9th.

**Benefit:** Whenever you damage an opponent with _[[feats/Cerberus Style|Cerberus Style]]_, that opponent cannot take 5-foot steps until the beginning of your next turn. Additionally, it is barred from dimensional travel. This effect functions as _[[spells/Dimensional Anchor|dimensional anchor]]_, except that its duration is 1 round. _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|Spell resistance]]_ applies; for the purpose of checks to overcome _spell resistance_, your caster level is equal to your character level.
