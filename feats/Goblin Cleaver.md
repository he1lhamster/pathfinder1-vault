# Goblin Cleaver (Combat)

You are ferocious at hewing smaller opponents.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Cleave|Cleave]]_, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, dwarf.

**Benefit:** When using _Cleave_ or _[[feats/Great Cleave|Great Cleave]]_, if your initial attack hits, you may take your additional attacks against any creature smaller than you that you threaten; your targets need not be adjacent to one another. Additional attacks you make against humanoids (goblinoid) gain a +2 circumstance bonus on attack rolls.
