# Bull-Catcher Toss (Combat)

You can use a charging foe's momentum to throw them aside.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Bull-Catcher Style|Bull-Catcher Style]]_, _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_; base attack bonus +8, brawlerACG level 4th, or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 4th.

**Benefit:** When you successfully grapple a creature with the _Bull-Catcher Style_ feat, you can immediately move that creature into any square you threaten. After it is placed, you can break your grapple as an immediate action to move the creature an additional 5 feet in any direction. You can't use this maneuver to move a foe into a space that is intrinsically dangerous or unstable, such as a pit, _[[spells/Wall Of Fire|wall of fire]]_, or midair.
