# Contingent Channeling

You can imbue others with your healing energy so that they can use it at the moment of greatest need.

**Prerequisites:** True _[[npcs/Healer|healer]]_ class feature, _[[feats/Selective Channeling|Selective Channeling]]_.

**Benefit:** You can use a standard action to touch an ally and _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ one of your daily uses of channel energy to create a repository of positive energy within that ally. This repository contains the same number and type of dice as normal for your channel energy feature, and it lasts for 1 minute. An ally who has such a repository can use an immediate action to roll the repository's dice and regain a number of hit points equal to the result. If an ally who has such a repository is reduced to negative hit points, the repository triggers, allowing the ally to _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ without using an action.
