# Spell Bane

While your _[[spells/Bane|bane]]_ weapon is active, creatures that your _bane_ affects find it more difficult to resist your spells.

**Prerequisites:** _Bane_ class feature.

**Benefit:** While your _bane_ class feature is affecting a creature type, the saving throw's DCs for your spells increase by +2 for creatures of that type.
