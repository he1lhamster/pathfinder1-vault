# Neither Elf nor Human

You have removed yourself from your heritage so thoroughly that even magic does not recognize you.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Exile's Path|Exile's Path]]_, _[[feats/Seen and Unseen|Seen and Unseen]]_, character level 11th, half-elf.

**Benefit:** You are not considered elven or human for the purpose of harmful spells or effects based on your type, like a _[[spells/Bane|bane]]_ weapon or a _[[classes/Ranger|ranger]]_'s favored enemy class feature.
