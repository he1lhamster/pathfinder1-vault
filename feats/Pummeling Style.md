# Pummeling Style (Combat, Style)

Your unarmed strikes weave together in an effortless combo, focusing on the spots you've weakened with the last hit.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_; base attack bonus +6, _[[classes/Brawler|brawler]]_'s flurry class feature, or flurry of blows class feature.

**Benefit:** Whenever you use a full-attack action or flurry of blows to make multiple attacks against a single opponent with unarmed strikes, total the damage from all hits before applying _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_. This ability works only with unarmed strikes, no matter what other abilities you might possess.
