# Fortified Armor Training (Combat)

You have learned to let your armor bear the brunt of the worst attacks.

**Prerequisites:** Proficient with armor or _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_.

**Benefit:** If an opponent scores a critical hit against you, you can turn the critical hit into a normal hit. If you do, either your armor or your _shield_ gains the _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ condition (your choice).
