# Spell Sponge

Your mystical connection with your spellcasting master attunes you to helpful magical effects.

**Prerequisites:** Animal companion or familiar, _[[feats/Share Spells|share spells]]_ ability.

**Benefit:** Whenever your master targets you with a harmless spell with a target of "you," the spell's duration is doubled as if modified by the _[[feats/Extend Spell|Extend Spell]]_ metamagic feat. This does not affect spells with a duration of concentration, instantaneous, or permanent, or spells already modified by _Extend Spell_.
