# Furious Focus (Combat)

Even in the midst of fierce and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Furious|furious]]_ blows, you can find focus in the carnage and your seemingly wild blows strike home.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** When you are wielding a two-handed weapon or a one-handed weapon with two hands, and using the _Power Attack_ feat, you do not suffer _Power Attack_'s penalty on melee attack rolls on the first attack you make each turn. You still suffer the penalty on any additional attacks, including attacks of opportunity.
