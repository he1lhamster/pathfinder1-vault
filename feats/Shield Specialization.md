# Shield Specialization (Combat)

You have mastered the use of one type of _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Proficiency with selected _shield_, _[[feats/Shield Focus|Shield Focus]]_, _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_ level 4th.

**Benefit:** Choose one type of _shield_ (_[[items/Armor/Buckler|buckler]]_, light, heavy, or _[[items/Shield/Tower shield|tower shield]]_). With the selected _shield_, you gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class against critical hit confirmation rolls. In addition, you may add your base _shield_ bonus (including the bonus from _Shield Focus_ but not including enhancement bonuses) to your CMD.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of _shield_.
