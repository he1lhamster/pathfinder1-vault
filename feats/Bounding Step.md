# Bounding Step

You can leap through difficult terrain like a deer or elk.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15, _[[feats/Nimble Moves|Nimble Moves]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on Acrobatics checks to keep your balance and Ref lex saves to avoid falling. Additionally, select one terrain type from the _[[classes/Ranger|ranger]]_ list of favored terrains. Within that terrain, the maximum number of feet of difficult terrain you can move through as if it were normal terrain increases by 10 feet.

**Normal:** _Nimble Moves_ allows you to move through 5 feet of difficult terrain each round as if it were normal terrain.

**Special:** If you have the favored terrain class feature, you do not select a terrain with this feat. Instead, this feat's increased movement through difficult terrain applies to all of your favored terrains.
