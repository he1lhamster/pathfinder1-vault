# Stony Step

The earth recognizes its kinship with you and does not impede your movement.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Oread|Oread]]_.

**Benefit:** Whenever you move, you may move through 5 feet of earth- or stone-based difficult terrain (rubble, stone stairs, and so on) each round as if it were normal terrain. The effects of this feat stack with similar feats such as _[[feats/Acrobatic Steps|Acrobatic Steps]]_ and _[[feats/Nimble Moves|Nimble Moves]]_. This feat allows you to take a 5-foot step into this kind of difficult terrain.
