# Dirty Critical Hit (Combat, Critical)

Your blows are not only _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_, but _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Debilitating|debilitating]]_ as well.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Critical Focus|Critical Focus]]_, Improved Dirty TrickAPG, base attack bonus +11.

**Benefit:** Whenever you confirm a critical hit, you can also affect the target as if you had succeeded at a dirty trick combat maneuver check. Doing so normally causes the target to suffer for 1 round one of the conditions applied by a dirty trick, unless you have feats or abilities that give you more dirty trick options.

**Special:** You can apply the effects of only one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess _[[feats/Critical Mastery|Critical Mastery]]_.
