# Latching Horror (Combat, Monster)

You induce _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ and loathing when you latch onto another living creature.

**Prerequisites:** _[[universal monster rules/Attach|Attach]]_ universal monster ability.

**Benefit:** When you use your _attach_ ability, your opponent must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier) to avoid becoming _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ while you remain attached. This is a mind-affecting _fear_ effect.
