# Fey Performance

The wind, trees, and local wildlife join in on your bardic performances.

**Prerequisites:** Bardic performance class ability.

**Benefit:** You can enhance your performance with nature's sights and sounds by expending an extra round of bardic performance at the start of the performance. The range of the performance increases by 30 feet. Furthermore, for the purposes of affecting blind and deaf creatures, this performance counts as having both audible and visible components. This feat doesn't function in environments devoid of animal and plant life.
