# Deny Death

Your ki is so strong that it can _[[feats/Deny Death|deny death]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Ki pool, _[[feats/Endurance|Endurance]]_

**Benefit:** As long as you have 1 ki point in your ki pool, when you fail your Constitution check to stabilize, you do not lose 1 hit point. If you succeed at the check, you can spend 1 ki point to _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ 1d6 hit points. If you roll a natural 20 on the check to stabilize, you can spend 1 ki point to _heal_ 2d6 hit points of damage instead.
