# Panther Style (Combat, Style)

You can _[[feats/Strike Back|strike back]]_ at enemies who attack you when you move.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 13, _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_.

**Benefit:** While using this style, when an opponent makes an attack of opportunity against you for moving through a threatened square, you can spend a swift action to make a retaliatory unarmed strike attack against that opponent. Your attack is resolved after the triggering attack of opportunity.
