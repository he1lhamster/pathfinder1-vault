# Shielded Caster (Teamwork)

Your allies cover you while you cast complicated spells.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you receive a +4 competence bonus on concentration checks. If your ally is wielding a _[[items/Armor/Buckler|buckler]]_ or a light _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_, this bonus increases by +1. If your ally is wielding a heavy _shield_ or a _[[items/Shield/Tower shield|tower shield]]_, this bonus increases by +2. Finally, if an enemy threatening you and your ally has the _[[feats/Disruptive|Disruptive]]_ feat, or another ability that increases the DC of concentration checks, the amount of the increase is halved.
