# Spirit of the Wild

Your mystic connection with one type of wilderness has grown even stronger.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Attuned to the Wild|Attuned to the Wild]]_, _[[feats/Guardian of the Wild|Guardian of the Wild]]_, elf.

**Benefit:** When you are in a terrain type you have selected the _Attuned to the Wild_ feat for, you gain a +4 bonus on Perception checks made to act in the surprise round of combat. If you act in the surprise round, you gain _[[universal monster rules/Blindsense|blindsense]]_ out to a range of 30 feet during the surprise round. If you are in an area that qualif ies as more than one kind of terrain, these bonuses do not stack; you receive the bonus for only one terrain type.
