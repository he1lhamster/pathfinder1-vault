# Defending Eidolon

You have trained your eidolon to protect you.

**Prerequisites:** _[[spells/Shield|Shield]]_ ally feature.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are adjacent to your eidolon, you can choose for the eidolon to take a -1 penalty on melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to gain a +1 _[[feats/Dodge|dodge]]_ bonus to your Armor Class. When your eidolon's base attack bonus reaches +5, and for every +5 thereafter, the penalty increases by -1 and the _dodge_ bonus increases by +1. You must choose to use this feat when your eidolon is making an attack or full-attack action with melee or natural weapons, and its effect lasts until your eidolon's next turn, or until you are no longer adjacent to the eidolon, whichever occurs first.
