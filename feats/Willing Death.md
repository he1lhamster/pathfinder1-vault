# Willing Death

You might have been a soldier in an army, a self-sacrificing lover, or a hero who rushed in where even angels feared to tread. You died because you valued someone else's life above your own.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Duskwalker|Duskwalker]]_.

**Benefit:** Twice per day, when an ally within 30 feet would die as a result of an attack or failing a saving throw, as an immediate action you can redirect the damage and effects to yourself. This functions as _[[classes/Paladin|paladin]]_'s sacrificeAPG. At 11th level, you can use this feat two additional times per day.
