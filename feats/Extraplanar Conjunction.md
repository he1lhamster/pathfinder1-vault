# Extraplanar Conjunction (Teamwork)

The innate _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Planar|planar]]_ energies of your allies empower your magical abilities, allowing you to make your _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ more difficult to resist.

**Prerequisites:** Any racial spell-like ability, outsider.

**Benefit:** Whenever you're adjacent to an outsider ally who also has this feat, the DC of any racial _spell-like abilities_ you use increases by 2 if your ally has the same racial spell-like ability. The proximity of multiple allies can't increase the DC further.
