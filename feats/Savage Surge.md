# Savage Surge (Combat, Performance)

You can channel your _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ into crowd-pleasing displays of brutality that aid you in the arena.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Intimidating Prowess|Intimidating Prowess]]_, _rage_ class feature.

**Benefit:** When attempting a performance combat check while raging, you may, as a free action, _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ a number of your daily rounds of _rage_ up to half your _[[classes/Barbarian|barbarian]]_ level to create a display of savagery. You gain a bonus on the performance combat check equal to half the number of rounds expended, rounded down. If you _expend_ all your remaining rounds of _rage_ in this manner, thus ending your _rage_, you gain an additional +2 bonus on the check.
