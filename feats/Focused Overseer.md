# Focused Overseer

Your attention to detail provides you with insights into how to more effectively and economically gain certain commodities.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Focused Worker|Focused Worker]]_.

**Benefit:** You can spend a day of downtime to purchase one type of capital for half its normal cost (see Purchasing Capital on page 77 of Ultimate Campaign). This capital must be the same as the focus capital you chose for the _Focused Worker_ feat. However, the cost of the neglected capital, chosen as part of the same _Focused Worker_ feat, increases by half again its normal amount. These changes in price apply to both the purchased cost and the earned cost of the affected forms of capital.

**Special:** You may take this feat twice, but only if you have also chosen the _Focused Worker_ feat twice. This feat only affects one feat's focus capital. The second time you take this feat, choose the other focus capital from your _Focused Worker_ feats.
