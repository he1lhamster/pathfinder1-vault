# Chainbreaker (Achievement)

Nothing rouses your fury and makes you more _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ in battle than the sight of slaves _[[conditions/Cowering|cowering]]_ before their masters.

**Prerequisites:** Over the course of at least five different occasions, free a cumulative total of 50+ sentient beings held in unjust captivity.

**Benefit:** When in combat with an opponent that you know owns or trades in slaves, once per round you may add a bonus to damage rolls for a melee attack, ranged attack, or targeted spell against that opponent. This bonus damage is +1 for every four Hit Dice you have.
