# Scarring Spell-Like Ability (Monster)

Your spell-like ability leaves mental scars.

**Prerequisites:** Spell-like ability at caster level 4th or higher.

**Benefit:** Choose one of your _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a _[[feats/Scarring Spell-Like Ability|scarring spell-like ability]]_ three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). When you use a _scarring spell-like ability_, a target that fails its saving throw against the spell-like ability takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against emotion and _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effects you create, and a -1 penalty on saving throws against other emotion and _fear_ effects, for the next 24 hours. If the spell-like ability doesn't allow a saving throw, you can't choose to enhance it with this feat. Penalties from multiple scarring _spell-like abilities_ don't stack. This feat can be applied only to _spell-like abilities_ with the emotionUM or _fear_ descriptor. You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 1. For a summary, see Table 3-1.

**Special:** This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.
