# Enhanced Ki Throw (Combat)

You enhance the force of your ki throws, enabling you to devastate your opponents as you slam them to the ground.

**Prerequisites:** Ki pool class feature, _[[feats/Ki Throw|Ki Throw]]_ (see the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide).

**Benefit:** When using the _Ki Throw_ feat, you can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ 1 ki point to amplify the force of your attack. If your _ki throw_ succeeds, when the target hits the ground, it takes damage as if you had hit it with an unarmed strike.
