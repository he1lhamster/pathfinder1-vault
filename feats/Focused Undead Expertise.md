# Focused Undead Expertise (Combat)

Your knowledge of the undead makes you especially effective when fighting them.

**Prerequisites:** Favored enemy (undead) class feature.

**Benefit:** You gain a bonus equal to half your favored enemy (undead) bonus on saving throws against ability damage, ability drain, _[[universal monster rules/Energy Drain|energy drain]]_, and negative energy effects. Once per day, when an undead creature's natural attack against you deals ability damage, deals ability drain, or bestows 1 or more negative levels, you can negate the damage, drain, or negative levels as an immediate action.
