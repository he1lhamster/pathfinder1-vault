# Improved Underhanded Teamwork

(Combat, Teamwork) You and your allies have trained together long enough to know how to exploit an opponent's disadvantage to make her predicament even worse.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Improved Dirty Trick|Improved Dirty Trick]]_, _[[feats/Underhanded Teamwork|Underhanded Teamwork]]_, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** Whenever an ally who also has this feat performs the dirty trick combat maneuver against a foe that you both threaten, you may attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver against the same foe as an immediate action to inflict a second condition. If the foe uses an action to remove the first condition, it also removes the condition imposed by your immediate action.
