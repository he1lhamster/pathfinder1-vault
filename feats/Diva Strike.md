# Diva Strike (Combat)

Those distracted by your performance leave themselves open to _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_ attacks.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 15; _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_; _[[feats/Diva Style|Diva Style]]_; _[[feats/Improved Feint|Improved Feint]]_; base attack bonus +7 or _[[classes/Bard|bard]]_ level 7th.

**Benefit:** While using _Diva Style_, the first time you hit with a melee weapon in a round, you deal an additional amount of damage equal to your Charisma modifier to a target that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. This damage is precision-based, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.
