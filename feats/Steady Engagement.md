# Steady Engagement (Combat)

You can draw on your excellent balance to _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ or disarm opponents when they try to disengage.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_, _[[feats/Stand Still|Stand Still]]_, worshiper of Irori.

**Benefit:** If you use _Stand Still_ to prevent an opponent from moving, you may make a disarm or _trip_ combat maneuver against your target as an immediate action.
