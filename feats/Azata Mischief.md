# Azata Mischief (Combat)

You move with uncommon _[[spells/Grace|grace]]_ that disorients enemies, causing foes that strike at you to overreach and stumble.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Agile Maneuvers|Agile Maneuvers]]_, _[[feats/Azata Style|Azata Style]]_*, _[[feats/Dodge|Dodge]]_, _[[feats/Mobility|Mobility]]_, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** While using _Azata Style_, whenever an opponent misses you with an attack of opportunity provoked by your movement through its threatened squares, you can attempt a _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ combat maneuver against that creature at the end of your turn as a swift action, provided you are still adjacent to the creature when you end your movement for the round. This _trip_ attempt does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You gain a bonus on your combat maneuver check equal to any bonuses to AC you gain against attacks of opportunity provoked by movement (such as that granted by the _Mobility_ feat).
