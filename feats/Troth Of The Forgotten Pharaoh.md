# Troth Of The Forgotten Pharaoh

You've pledged your body to the Forgotten Pharaoh, and are willing to _[[spells/Sacrifice|sacrifice]]_ yourself to keep his secrets even in death.

**Prerequisites:** Must be a member of the Cult of the Forgotten Pharaoh.

**Benefit:** Upon taking this feat, you undergo a ritual where the cartouche of Pharaoh Hakotep I is carved into your flesh (typically on the chest or back), and then embellished with painful crimson and ochre tattoos. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete, and you take 3 points of damage from the wound (see Special, below). Upon completion of the ritual, you gain the feat's benefits. As an immediate action, or when you die, you can cause white-hot fire to burst from the tattooed cartouche on your flesh, immolating your body in a bright flash and instantly reducing it to ash. If you are still alive, you are immediately slain. Spells such as _[[spells/Raise Dead|raise dead]]_ or _[[spells/Speak with Dead|speak with dead]]_ cannot be used on your remains, but your equipment is unaffected. As the fire consumes you, fiery snakes _[[items/Weapon/Whip|whip]]_ out of your body in a 5-foot-radius burst, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 per character level. Creatures in the area can attempt a Reflex save to negate the damage (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Constitution modifier). In addition, creatures within a 10-foot burst must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Constitution modifier) or be _[[conditions/Blinded|blinded]]_ for 1 round. Blind or sightless creatures are unaffected by this _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Blinding|blinding]]_ effect.

**Special:** You permanently lose 3 hit points when you take this feat. This damage can only be healed with a _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_ or _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ spell, but doing so causes you to lose all benefits of this feat.
