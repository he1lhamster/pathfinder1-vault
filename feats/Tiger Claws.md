# Tiger Claws (Combat)

You can _[[spells/Sacrifice|sacrifice]]_ multiple attacks to make a single _[[feats/Devastating Strike|devastating strike]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Tiger Style|Tiger Style]]_, base attack bonus +6 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 5th.

**Benefit:** While you are using the _Tiger Style_ feat and have both hands free, you can use a full-round action to make a single unarmed strike with both hands. Use your highest base attack bonus, rolling unarmed strike damage for each hand separately and multiplying both if you score a critical hit. If you use _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_ in conjunction with this attack, increase your Strength bonus on one of the damage rolls by an additional one-half your Strength bonus. If you hit, you can attempt a bull rush maneuver with a +2 bonus on the combat maneuver check. This bull rush attempt provokes no attack of opportunity from your opponent, but you cannot move with that opponent if your bull rush is successful.
