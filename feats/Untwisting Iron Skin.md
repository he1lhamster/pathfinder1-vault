# Untwisting Iron Skin (Combat)

Your _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ has tempered your flesh to resist blows as though it were forged iron.

**Prerequisites:** Str 15; Wis 13; _[[feats/Perfect Style|Perfect Style]]_; _[[feats/Toughness|Toughness]]_; _[[feats/Untwisting Iron Strength|Untwisting Iron Strength]]_; base attack bonus +13 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 13th.

**Benefit:** When using _Perfect Style_, you gain an amount of DR/adamantine equal to 1/3 your character level (maximum 6). Additionally, whenever you break an item with a hardness of 10 or more, you gain DR 1/- for a number of rounds equal to half the item's hit points (maximum 10 rounds); the value of this _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_ increases by 1 for every 5 points of hardness above 10 the _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ item had. You can spend 1 ki point as a swift action to double either of the _damage reduction_ values granted by this feat for 1 round.
