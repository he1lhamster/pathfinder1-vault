# Willing Accomplice

Your well-placed support can aid friends and allies in maintaining their most precious secrets.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, Bluff 3 ranks, Sense Motive 1 rank.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can attempt a Bluff check to aid another's Disguise check. In addition, when attempting such a check to aid a _[[classes/Vigilante|vigilante]]_ ally in maintaining that ally's social identity (see page 9), a successful check grants that ally a +5 bonus instead of the normal +2.
