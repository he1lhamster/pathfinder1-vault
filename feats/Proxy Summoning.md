# Proxy Summoning

Creatures you _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ can act as proxies to deliver your spells to foes.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to cast conjuration (summoning) spells or a conjuration (summoning) spell-like ability, caster level 5th.

**Benefit:** Whenever you cast a touch spell while adjacent to a creature you summoned (including an eidolon), you can have the summoned creature carry the spell's charge. Once the spell is cast, you and any creature you _summon_ gain the _[[feats/Share Spells|share spells]]_ ability (Core Rulebook 52). This feat doesn't qualify you for feats or other rules options that require you to have an animal companion, familiar, or similar allied creature with the _share spells_ ability.
