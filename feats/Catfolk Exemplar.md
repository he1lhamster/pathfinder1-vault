# Catfolk Exemplar

Your feline traits are more defined and prominent than those of other members of your race.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Catfolk|Catfolk]]_.

**Benefit:** You can take the _[[feats/Aspect of the Beast|Aspect of the Beast]]_ feat (Advanced Player's Guide 151) even if you do not meet the normal prerequisites. Furthermore, your catlike nature manifests in one of the following ways. You choose the manifestation when you take this feat, and cannot change it later. 
Enhanced Senses (Ex): If you have _[[universal monster rules/Low-Light Vision|low-light vision]]_, you gain the _[[universal monster rules/Scent|scent]]_ _catfolk_ racial trait. If you have the _scent_ racial trait, you gain _low-light vision_. 
Fast Sprinter (Ex): You gain a 10-foot racial bonus to your speed when using the charge, run, or withdraw actions. If you have the sprinter racial trait, your racial bonus to speed when using the charge, run, or withdraw action increases to a 20-foot bonus. 
Sharp Claws (Ex): If you do not have the cat's claws racial trait or the claws of the beast manifestation from the _Aspect of the Beast_ feat (Advanced Player's Guide 151), you gain the cat's claws racial trait. If you have either the cat's claws racial trait or the claws of the beast manifestation, your claw damage increases to 1d6.

**Special:** You can take this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you select it, you must choose a different manifestation.
