# Bless Equipment

You can _[[spells/Bless|bless]]_ armor and weapons with a touch to imbue them with magical properties.

**Prerequisites:** Caster level 3rd, channel energy class feature.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you may _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ uses of your channel energy ability to touch a single weapon, suit of armor, or _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ and temporarily grant it one weapon, armor, or _shield_ special ability. To _bless_ a piece of equipment with a particular blessing, you must _expend_ a number of uses of channel energy equal to the number listed in the table above, and your caster level must be equal to or greater than that listed for the selected blessing. This blessing lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number of damage dice you are capable of dealing or healing with your channel energy ability (for example, the blessing of a _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ capable of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Channeling|channeling]]_ 3d6 points of damage would last for 3 rounds), during which time the item is treated as though it possessed the selected special ability. If the piece of equipment belongs to an unwilling creature, that creature may attempt a Will save to prevent the blessing, as if attempting a saving throw against your channel energy ability (so bonuses from _[[universal monster rules/Channel Resistance|channel resistance]]_ and similar effects apply); if the creature succeeds at its save, the channeled energy is expended to no effect. Only magical and masterwork weapons, armor, and shields may be _[[feats/Blessed|blessed]]_ with this feat. When you _bless_ a masterwork item, you must _expend_ one additional use of your channel energy ability beyond those normally expended to grant the selected blessing. In addition to the selected blessing, the masterwork item gains a temporary +1 enhancement bonus for the blessing's duration. You can grant a piece of equipment only one blessing at a time. Blessing an item that has already been _blessed_ by you or another character replaces the preexisting blessing with the new one and resets the duration.
