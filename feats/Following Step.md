# Following Step (Combat)

You can repeatedly close the distance when foes try to move away, without impeding your normal movement.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Step Up|Step Up]]_.

**Benefit:** When using the _Step Up_ feat to follow an adjacent foe, you may move up to 10 feet. You may still take a 5-foot step during your next turn, and any movement you make using this feat does not subtract any distance from your movement during your next turn.

**Normal:** You can only take a 5-foot step to follow an opponent using _Step Up_.
