# Erastil's Blessing (Combat)

Old Deadeye's favor grants you prowess with a bow that far exceeds your own physical capabilities.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_[[items/Weapon/Longbow|longbow]]_), must be a worshiper of Erastil.

**Benefit:** You can use your Wisdom modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier on ranged attack rolls when using a bow.
