# Heroic Recovery

You can throw off the effects of crippling conditions.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Diehard|Diehard]]_, _[[feats/Endurance|Endurance]]_, base Fortitude save +4.

**Benefit:** Once per day as a standard action you may attempt a new saving throw against a harmful condition or affliction requiring a Fortitude save that is affecting you. If this save against the affliction fails, there is no additional effect, but a successful save counts toward curing an affliction such as poison or disease. You cannot use this feat to recover from instantaneous effects, effects that do not allow a saving throw, or effects that do not require a Fortitude save.
