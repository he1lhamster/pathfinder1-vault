# Recalcitrant

You are determined to maintain your own will and bow to no one.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Iron Will|Iron Will]]_, _[[monsters/Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]]_.

**Benefit:** Add 2 to the DCs of checks to intimidate you. While you are subject to a _[[spells/Charm Person|charm person]]_, _[[spells/Dominate Person|dominate person]]_, or other charm or compulsion effect, orders to perform normal or benign actions are treated as actions you wouldn't normally do. Orders to perform actions you wouldn't normally do are treated as obviously harmful or self-destructive.

**Normal:** While you are under certain charm or compulsion spell effects, commands to perform actions you wouldn't ordinarily do, including obviously harmful or self-destructive acts, allow a new saving throw or end the effect entirely, as described in the spell.
