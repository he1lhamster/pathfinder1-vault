# Slow Faller

You can reduce the amount of falling damage you take when you are close to a wall.

**Prerequisites:** Acrobatics 5 ranks or _[[spells/Slow|slow]]_ fall class feature.

**Benefit:** When you are within arm's reach of a wall, you can _slow_ your descent, as long as you are not in heavy armor. You take damage as if the fall were 10 feet shorter than it actually is. This ability stacks with the _slow_ fall class feature.

**Special:** You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you take damage as if the fall were an additional 10 feet shorter.
