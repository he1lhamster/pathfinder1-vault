# Structural Strike (Combat, Panache)

You use your knowledge of how things fit together to find ways to _[[feats/Punch Through|punch through]]_ the defenses of any foe.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (engineering) 5 ranks, _[[feats/Precise Strike|precise strike]]_ class feature or precise strikeACG deed.

**Benefit:** When using the duelist's or _[[classes/Swashbuckler|swashbuckler]]_'s _precise strike_, you can make a single strike as a standard action against an opponent that would be otherwise immune to your _precise strike_ damage. If you hit, you deal your _precise strike_ damage as normal against this enemy. When using the _swashbuckler_'s _precise strike_ deed, you can spend 1 panache point as a swift action to deal your regular _precise strike_ damage on a single attack against an opponent that would typically be immune. If you have both class features, you can use either option in order to apply the full damage from both versions of _precise strike_. Additionally, against opponents with a chance of _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to your _precise strike_ (such as an opponent wearing armor with the _[[universal monster rules/Fortification|fortification]]_ special ability), this feat reduces their chance of _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Negating|negating]]_ your precise strikes by 10%.
