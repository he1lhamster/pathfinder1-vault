# Touch Of The Brackish Emperor

Your touch can suppress spells that aid in breathing water.

**Prerequisites:** Character level 5th, worshiper of Kelizandri,

**Benefit:** Once per day while _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_, you can touch a creature in order to suppress any spells that allow the creature to breathe _underwater_ (air bubbleUC, _[[spells/Life Bubble|life bubble]]_, _[[universal monster rules/Water Breathing|water breathing]]_, and so on) for 5 minutes. Suppressing the spells requires you to roll 1d20 + your character level; the DC for each spell is 11 + the spell's caster level (if the spells affecting the creature have differing caster levels, you might dispel some but not the others). This is a spell-like ability. At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you can use this touch an additional time each day.
