# Lantern Glare (Combat)

Like an _[[spells/Archon's Aura|archon's aura]]_, the light of your thrown weapons can shake even the fiercest of foes.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Lantern Light|Lantern Light]]_, _[[feats/Lantern Style|Lantern Style]]_, _[[feats/Point-Blank Shot|Point-Blank Shot]]_, _[[feats/Precise Shot|Precise Shot]]_, good or lawful alignment, caster level 11th or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 11th.

**Benefit:** Creatures you hit with a thrown weapon as well as creatures within 20 feet of your target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Charisma modifier) or become _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ until they damage you or 24 hours have passed. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw or that damages you after becoming _shaken_ becomes immune to this effect for 24 hours.
