# Infiltrator (Story)

You have sacrificed your true identity in order to achieve your goal.

**Prerequisites:** Must have adopted an assumed or secret identity associated with an enemy organization.

**Benefit:** Once per day when you succeed at a saving throw to negate a _[[spells/Divination|divination]]_, you learn what the _divination_ would have revealed and can spend an immediate action to cause the _divination_ to return appropriate false information you imagine that would fit with your cover identity.

**Goal:** Thwart the organization you have infiltrated, defeating or turning to your cause an appropriate number of challenging foes in the process.

**Completion Benefit:** Whenever a spell or spell-like ability would reveal information about you, you can attempt a Will saving throw. If your saving throw is successful, the spell reveals nothing about you. You can use this feat's benefits to instead give false information, as detailed above.
