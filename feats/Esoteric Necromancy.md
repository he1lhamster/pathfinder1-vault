# Esoteric Necromancy (Esoteric)

Your expertise with entropic resin causes your necromancy spells to strike _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ in those they affect.

**Benefit:** When you cast a necromancy spell using entropic resin as an esoteric material component, one target of that spell becomes _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_. If your spell allows a saving throw and the target succeeds at its save, it is unaffected by this effect. If the spell causes the target to become _shaken_ or _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_, this effect doesn't increase the severity of that condition (so a spell that frightens a creature wouldn't instead cause it to become _[[conditions/Panicked|panicked]]_ due to this feat). This is a mind-affecting _fear_ effect. When you gain entropic resin's greater component effect with a necromancy spell, treat your caster level as an additional 1 higher for determining the damage dice. (This also increases the spell's maximum damage dice if applicable.)
