# Butterfly's Sting (Combat)

You can forgo a critical hit in order to pass it on to an ally.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, worshiper of Desna.

**Benefit:** When you confirm a critical hit against a creature, you can choose to forgo the effect of the critical hit and grant a critical hit to the next ally who hits that creature with a melee attack before the start of your next turn. Your attack only deals normal damage, and the next ally to hit the target automatically confirms the attack as a critical hit.
