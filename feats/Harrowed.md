# Harrowed

Numerous Harrow readings early in your life seem to have hit the mark precisely, increasing your belief that you are destined for a specific purpose in life.

**Benefit:** You get a +1 bonus on all Will saves made to resist enchantment effects. Once per day, you may draw a card from a _[[items/Mundane/Harrow deck|Harrow deck]]_ you own. At any one time for the rest of that day, you may apply a +2 bonus on any d20 roll modified by the card's suit. For example, if you drew a card from the suit of Dexterity, you could apply this +2 bonus on an Initiative check, a Ref lex save, a Dexterity-based skill check, or a ranged attack roll. You may assign this +2 bonus after you make the roll, but you must do so before you know whether the roll was a success or not.
