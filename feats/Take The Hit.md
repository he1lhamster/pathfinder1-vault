# Take The Hit (Teamwork)

You can _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ your partner's body with your own.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Bonded Mind|Bonded Mind]]_, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** As long as an ally with the _Bonded Mind_ feat is adjacent to you, you can choose to absorb up to half of the hit point damage from any attack that strikes him, as if subject to a _[[spells/Shield Other|shield other]]_ spell. Using this ability is an immediate action, and it only applies to one attack, even if the ally is hit by multiple attacks as part of the same action.
