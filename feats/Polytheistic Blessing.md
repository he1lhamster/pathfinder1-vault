# Polytheistic Blessing

You are granted a small bit of _[[spells/Divine Power|divine power]]_ as a result of your veneration of a pantheon of deities.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 13, must worship a pantheon.

**Benefit:** When you take this feat, select a pantheon from the list below. You gain the listed spell-like ability for your selected pantheon, usable once per day. If the granted spell allows a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier.

**Special:** If you act out of line with the tenets of your pantheon's beliefs, you lose the ability to cast the granted spell-like ability until you have received an _[[spells/Atonement|atonement]]_ for your transgression (as a _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ attempting to regain lost class abilities).
