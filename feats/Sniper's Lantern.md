# Sniper's Lantern

You use your innate magic powers to target enemies and spot their weaknesses.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Point-Blank Shot|Point-Blank Shot]]_, _[[spells/Dancing Lights|dancing lights]]_ racial spell-like ability.

**Benefit:** You can use your _dancing lights_ racial spell-like ability to create one orb of penetrating light. This light grants you a +2 insight bonus on all ranged attacks made against targets within 5 feet of the light's location. You can direct this light to a new location anywhere within the spell's range as a move action, otherwise the effect functions exactly like _dancing lights_. You can use this ability once per day, plus an additional time per day when your caster level for your racial _dancing lights_ spell-like ability reaches 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th.
