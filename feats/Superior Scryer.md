# Superior Scryer

You are adept at seeing more when _[[spells/Scrying|scrying]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Spell Focus|Spell Focus]]_ (_[[spells/Divination|divination]]_), the ability to cast at least one spell of the _scrying_ subschool.

**Benefit:** When casting a _scrying_ spell, you see through the spell's sensor with _[[spells/Darkvision|darkvision]]_ 60 feet, whether or not you possess _darkvision_ normally and whether or not the spell normally allows you to see with _darkvision_. If the spell sends back sensory information only within 10 feet of the sensor (such as with _scrying_ and greater _scrying_), this feat doesn't increase that range. You receive a +2 bonus on Perception checks to notice things through a _scrying_ sensor, and your _[[spells/Prying Eyes|prying eyes]]_ and _[[spells/Insect Spies|insect spies]]_ also receive a +2 bonus on Perception checks. When you use the _scrying_ or greater _scrying_ spell, you have a 10% increase to the chance of using spells through the sensor.
