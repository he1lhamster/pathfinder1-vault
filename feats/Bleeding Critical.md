# Bleeding Critical (Combat, Critical)

Your critical hits cause opponents to _[[universal monster rules/Bleed|bleed]]_ profusely.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Critical Focus|Critical Focus]]_, base attack bonus +11.

**Benefit:** Whenever you score a critical hit with a slashing or piercing weapon, your opponent takes 2d6 points of _bleed_ damage (see Appendix 2) each round on his turn, in addition to the damage dealt by the critical hit. _Bleed_ damage can be stopped by a DC 15 _[[spells/Heal|Heal]]_ skill check or through any magical healing. The effects of this feat stack.

**Special:** You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess _[[feats/Critical Mastery|Critical Mastery]]_.
