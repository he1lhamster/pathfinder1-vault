# Arcane Vendetta

The mistreatment of your people by an arcane society (such as Numeria's Technic League or the White Witches of Irrisen) has made you particularly eager to inflict _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ on those who use arcane magic.

**Prerequisites:** Spellcraft 1 rank.

**Benefit:** You deal +2 damage with weapon attacks made against any target you have witnessed casting an arcane spell (not using a spell-like ability) in the last 5 rounds. You must have successfully identified the spell with a Spellcraft check to know without a doubt that the spell is arcane.
