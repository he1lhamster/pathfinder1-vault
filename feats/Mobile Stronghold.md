# Mobile Stronghold (Combat)

You can use your _[[items/Shield/Tower shield|tower shield]]_ to block magical attacks.

**Prerequisites:** Str 17, _[[feats/Mobile Bulwark Style|Mobile Bulwark Style]]_, _[[feats/Mobile Fortress|Mobile Fortress]]_, _[[feats/Shield Focus|Shield Focus]]_, _[[feats/Tower _[[spells/Shield|Shield]]_ Proficiency|Tower _Shield_ Proficiency]]_, base attack bonus +7.

**Benefit:** While using a _tower shield_, you do not suffer a penalty on attack rolls because of the _shield_'s encumbrance. While using _Mobile Bulwark Style_, whenever you use a _tower shield_ to gain total cover, you also gain partial cover (and grant partial cover to adjacent allies) against spells passing through the selected edge of your space. Also, while using this style, you can gain total cover against a single attack made against you as an immediate or swift action.
