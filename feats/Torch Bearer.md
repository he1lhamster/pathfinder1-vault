# Torch Bearer (Combat)

You can make use of a _[[items/Mundane/Torch|torch]]_ as a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_, macelike weapon.

**Benefit:** You treat a _torch_ as a light weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a _[[items/Weapon/Light mace|light mace]]_ of its size plus 1 point of fire damage, and you do not incur penalties as you would for using it as an improvised weapon.

**Normal:** A _torch_ used in combat is treated as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a _[[items/Weapon/Gauntlet|gauntlet]]_ of its size plus 1 point of fire damage.
