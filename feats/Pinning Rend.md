# Pinning Rend (Combat)

You tear flesh when you damage an opponent that you have _[[conditions/Pinned|pinned]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Greater Grapple|Greater Grapple]]_, _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +9 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 9th.

**Benefit:** While you have an opponent _pinned_, when you succeed at a grapple combat maneuver check to deal an opponent damage using an unarmed strike or a light or one-handed weapon, that opponent also takes _[[universal monster rules/Bleed|bleed]]_ damage equal to your unarmed strike or weapon damage dice. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is immune to the effects of this feat.
