# Fiendish Wings

You have great wings capable of bearing you aloft. The wings you gain this way vary, from the bat-like wings common among demons and devils, to the feathered wings of Szuriel's generals, to the stretched-skin membranes of kytons.

**Prerequisites:** Non-native outsider with the evil subtype.

**Benefit:** Your wings grant you a fly speed equal to your base speed with good maneuverability.
