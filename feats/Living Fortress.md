# Living Fortress (Teamwork)

Stubborn, tenacious, and proud, you're all but immovable when you have kin to back you up.

**Prerequisites:** Dwarf, hardy racial trait.

**Benefit:** Whenever you fight defensively and you're adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, your racial bonus on saving throws against spells and _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ increases by 2.
