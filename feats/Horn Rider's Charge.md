# Horn Rider's Charge (Combat)

When the animal you're lashed to charges, you use its momentum in your own attack.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Horn Rider|Horn Rider]]_, base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** Whenever you're lashed into a _[[items/Mundane/Horn harness|horn harness]]_ and you ready an action to make a melee attack against the target of a charge made by the creature you're lashed to, you gain the attack bonus for charging and your attack deals double damage (or triple damage with a _[[items/Weapon/Lance|lance]]_). This benef it does not stack with the benef it of _[[feats/Spirited Charge|Spirited Charge]]_.
