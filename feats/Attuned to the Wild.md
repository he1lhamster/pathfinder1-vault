# Attuned to the Wild

You share a strong mystic connection with one type of wilderness terrain.

**Prerequisites:** Elf.

**Benefit:** Select one type of terrain from the _[[classes/Ranger|ranger]]_ class's favored terrain class feature (except urban). While you are in your selected terrain type, your natural healing rate (the amount of hit points and ability damage you _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ from a full night's rest) doubles.

**Special:** You can take this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take it, it applies to a different terrain type.
