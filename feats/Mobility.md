# Mobility (Combat)

You can easily move through a dangerous melee.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Dodge|Dodge]]_.

**Benefit:** You get a +4 _dodge_ bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity caused when you move out of or within a threatened area. A condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose _dodge_ bonuses. _Dodge_ bonuses stack with each other, unlike most types of bonuses.
