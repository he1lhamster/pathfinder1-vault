# Selective Spell (Metamagic)

Your allies need not _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ _[[feats/Friendly Fire|friendly fire]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Spellcraft 10 ranks.

**Benefit:** When casting a _[[feats/Selective Spell|selective spell]]_ with an area effect and a duration of instantaneous, you can choose a number of targets in the area equal to the ability score modifier used to determine bonus spells of the same type (Charisma for bards, oracles, paladins, sorcerers, and summoners; Intelligence for witches and wizards; Wisdom for clerics, druids, inquisitors, and rangers). These targets are excluded from the effects of your spell. A _selective spell_ uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level. Spells that do not have an area of effect or a duration of instantaneous do not benefit from this feat.
