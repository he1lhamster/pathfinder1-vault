# Falling Water Gambit (Combat)

You have integrated both the Roaring Falls and Shrouded Lake techniques of Aldori swordplay into a seamless union.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Aldori _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Dueling|Dueling]]_ Disciple|Aldori _Dueling_ Disciple]]_, _[[feats/Duelist Of The Roaring Falls|Duelist of the Roaring Falls]]_, _[[feats/Duelist Of The Shrouded Lake|Duelist of the Shrouded Lake]]_, _[[feats/Exotic Weapon Proficiency|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]]_ (_[[items/Weapon/Aldori _dueling_ sword|Aldori _dueling_ sword]]_), _[[feats/Weapon Finesse|Weapon Finesse]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_Aldori _dueling_ sword_), base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit:** When attacking a creature denied its Dexterity bonus to AC because of your successful feint, you increase the threat range of your _Aldori _dueling_ sword_ by 1 (typically to 18-20/x2), and gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls to confirm critical hits. After you make a _dueling_ _[[feats/Dodge|dodge]]_ or succeed at a _dueling_ parry during a duel, you can make an attack of opportunity against the foe who attacked you if that foe is _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_, _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_, or _[[conditions/Panicked|panicked]]_. To gain these benefits, you must be wielding only an _Aldori _dueling_ sword_ (not using a _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_, an off-hand weapon, armor spikes, unarmed strikes, or natural weapons).
