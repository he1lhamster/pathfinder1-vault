# Felling Escape (Combat)

Through the use of fluid contortions and manipulations of leverage, you can throw your opponent to the ground after escaping a grapple.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Improved Trip|Improved Trip]]_.

**Benefit:** When you break an opponent's grapple with a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check, you can spend a swift action to make a _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ attempt against that opponent.
