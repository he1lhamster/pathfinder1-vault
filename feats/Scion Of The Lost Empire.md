# Scion Of The Lost Empire (Teamwork)

Though you might not be able to trace your lineage back to Azlant, you can feel the ancient power in your blood whenever you're near others like yourself.

**Prerequisites:** Human (Chelaxian or Taldan).

**Benefit:** While you're adjacent to an ethnically Chelish or Taldan ally who also has this feat, you gain a +2 competence bonus on a single attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill check as an immediate action. You must choose to use this ability before making the roll.
