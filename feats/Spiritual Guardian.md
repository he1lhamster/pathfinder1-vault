# Spiritual Guardian

Your spiritual guardians are more powerful than those of most others.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to cast _[[spells/Spiritual Weapon|spiritual weapon]]_ or _[[spells/Spiritual Ally|spiritual ally]]_, spirit magic class feature.

**Benefit:** Whenever you cast _spiritual weapon_, _spiritual ally_, or a similar spell that grants you a _[[feats/Spiritual Guardian|spiritual guardian]]_, that _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Guardian|guardian]]_ uses your _[[classes/Shaman|shaman]]_ level instead of your base attack bonus to determine its base attack bonus, potentially granting it multiple attacks. Additionally, it gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ as well as on damage rolls.
