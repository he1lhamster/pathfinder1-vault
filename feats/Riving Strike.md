# Riving Strike (Combat)

When you infuse your weapon with arcane might, your attacks make foes more susceptible to magic.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Arcane Strike|Arcane Strike]]_, ability to cast arcane spells.

**Benefit:** If you have a weapon that is augmented by your _Arcane Strike_ feat, when you damage a creature with an attack made with that weapon, that creature takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against spells and _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_. This effect lasts for 1 round.
