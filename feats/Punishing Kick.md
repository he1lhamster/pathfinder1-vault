# Punishing Kick (Combat)

Your kicks are so powerful you use them to push or _[[spells/Knock|knock]]_ back your foes.

**Prerequisites:** Con 13, Wis 13, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit:** You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). On a successful hit, the attack deals damage normally and you can choose to push your target 5 feet or attempt to _knock_ them _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_. If you decide to push the target, it is moved 5 feet directly away from you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and the target must end this move in a safe space it can stand in. If you decide to attempt to _knock_ the target _prone_, the target receives a Fortitude saving throw with a DC of 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier to avoid the effect. You may attempt a _[[feats/Punishing Kick|punishing kick]]_ attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round.

**Special:** A hungry _[[monsters/Ghost|ghost]]_ _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ receives _Punishing Kick_ as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A _monk_ may attempt a _punishing kick_ attack a number of times per day equal to his _monk_ level, plus one more time per day for every four levels he has in classes other than _monk_.
