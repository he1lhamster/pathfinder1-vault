# Bouncing Spell (Metamagic)

You can direct a failed spell against a different target.

**Benefit:** Whenever a _[[feats/Bouncing Spell|bouncing spell]]_ targeting a single creature has no effect on its intended target (whether due to _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ or a successful saving throw) you may, as a swift action, redirect it to target another eligible creature within range. The redirected spell behaves in all ways as if its new target were the original target for the spell. Spells that affect a target in any way (including a lesser effect from a successful saving throw) may not be redirected in this manner. A _bouncing spell_ uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
