# Natural Ruler

You have a special talent for ruling a nation, and take to the task with ease.

**Prerequisites:** Hold a _[[feats/Leadership|leadership]]_ role related to running a kingdom.

**Benefit:** Choose an ability score. Any time your _leadership_ role calls for that ability score to affect one of your kingdom's attributes, your modifier to that ability score is treated as being +2 higher. For example, if you choose Charisma and occupy the General or High Priest _leadership_ role, your Charisma modifier to affect your kingdom's stability would be +2 higher than normal. However, if you occupied the Spymaster _leadership_ role-which employs the Intelligence and Wisdom ability scores-this feat would grant no benefit. Additionally, the entire kingdom gains +2 Stability for as long as you occupy a _leadership_ role.

**Special:** You may gain this feat multiple times, but each time you must choose a different ability score. The bonus to Stability gained from this feat stacks.
