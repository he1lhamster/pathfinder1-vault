# Dampen Presence

Your habitual stillness makes you difficult to perceive for creatures that use _[[universal monster rules/Blindsight|blindsight]]_ or _[[universal monster rules/Blindsense|blindsense]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Skill Focus|Skill Focus]]_ (Stealth), Stealth 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** You may use the Stealth skill to hide from any creature attempting to perceive you using _blindsight_ or _blindsense_, even if you are clearly in that creature's perceptual field. This feat does not confer any advantages against other forms of perception, such as _[[universal monster rules/Scent|scent]]_, _[[spells/Vision|vision]]_, or _[[universal monster rules/Tremorsense|tremorsense]]_.
