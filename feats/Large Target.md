# Large Target (Combat)

The larger a creature is, the easier you find it to strike a vulnerable spot when attacking with a _[[items/Weapon/Sling|sling]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Proficient with _sling_.

**Benefit:** Your attacks with all kinds of slings add a +1 bonus on damage rolls for every size category your opponent is larger than you. For example, if you are Small and your opponent Large (a difference of two sizes), you gain a +2 damage bonus. This is considered precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.
