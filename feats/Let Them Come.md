# Let Them Come (Combat)

You have trained to fight onrushing enemy hordes. With a carefully timed strike you ensure that their reckless charge will be their undoing.

**Prerequisites:** Dwarf, Ninth Battalion TPA 25.

**Benefit:** You treat all one- or two-handed melee weapons as if they had the brace special feature.

**Normal:** Only weapons with the brace special feature can be readied against charges.
