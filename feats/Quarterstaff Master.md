# Quarterstaff Master (Combat)

You can wield a _[[items/Weapon/Quarterstaff|quarterstaff]]_ as either a two-handed or one-handed weapon.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_quarterstaff_), base attack bonus +5.

**Benefit:** By employing a number of different stances and techniques, you can wield a _quarterstaff_ as a one-handed weapon. At the start of your turn, you decide whether or not you are going to wield the _quarterstaff_ as a one-handed or two-handed weapon. When you wield it as a one-handed weapon, your other hand is free, and you cannot use the staff as a double weapon. You can take the feat _[[feats/Weapon Specialization|Weapon Specialization]]_ in the _quarterstaff_ even if you have no levels in _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_.
