# Dispelling Critical (Critical)

Your blows attack the physical and arcane forms of your enemies at the same time.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Arcane Strike|Arcane Strike]]_, base attack bonus +11, ability to cast _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_.

**Benefit:** If you have _dispel magic_ prepared or can cast it spontaneously, when you score a critical hit against an opponent, you may use a swift action to cast _dispel magic_ to make a targeted dispel against that opponent.
