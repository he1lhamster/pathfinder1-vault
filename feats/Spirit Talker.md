# Spirit Talker

By forging a temporary bond with a spirit, you gain access to an unfamiliar hex.

**Prerequisites:** Hex class feature; _[[classes/Shaman|shaman]]_ level 6th or _[[classes/Witch|witch]]_ level 6th.

**Benefit:** Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes communing with a _shaman_ spirit of your choice. When you do, you gain the temporary use of one hex from its list of hexes. This hex is added to your list of available hexes for the next hour, after which you immediately lose all benefits of that hex.
