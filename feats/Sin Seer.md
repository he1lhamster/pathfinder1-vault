# Sin Seer

Unlike others who have taken the oath against undeath (see page 60), your preoccupation with the undead does not cloud your view of good and evil.

**Prerequisites:** _[[spells/Detect Undead|Detect undead]]_ _[[classes/Paladin|paladin]]_ class feature.

**Benefit:** You gain the _[[spells/Detect Evil|detect evil]]_ class feature. You may use it or the _detect undead_ class feature, but not at the same time.
