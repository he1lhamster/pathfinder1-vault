# Focused Disbelief

So certain is your disbelief in the authority of the gods that you can brush aside their spells without effort.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Divine Defiance|Divine Defiance]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ equal to 11 + your character level. This _spell resistance_ applies only against spells and _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ covered by the _Divine Defiance_ feat. You can lower this _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ for 1 round as a standard action.
