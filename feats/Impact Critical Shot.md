# Impact Critical Shot (Combat, Critical)

With a series of ranged attacks, you bring your foes to their knees or force them to move.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Point-Blank Shot|Point-Blank Shot]]_, base attack bonus +9.

**Benefit:** Whenever you score a critical hit with a ranged attack, in addition to the normal damage your attack deals, if your confirmation roll exceeds your opponent's CMD, you can push your opponent back as if from the bull rush combat maneuver or _[[spells/Knock|knock]]_ that target _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ as if from a _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ combat maneuver. If you choose to bull rush, you cannot move with the target. Your maneuver does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

**Normal:** You must perform a bull rush combat maneuver to bull rush an opponent, and you must perform a _trip_ combat maneuver to _trip_ an opponent.
