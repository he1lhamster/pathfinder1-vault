# Empty Quiver Flurry (Combat)

You can use your ranged weapons to make melee attacks that keep foes at bay as you shoot them.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Empty Quiver Flexibility|Empty Quiver Flexibility]]_, _[[feats/Empty Quiver Style|Empty Quiver Style]]_, _[[feats/Rapid Shot|Rapid Shot]]_, Stabbing ShotAPG, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ with the chosen weapon.

**Benefit:** While using _Empty Quiver Style_ or _[[feats/Stabbing Shot|Stabbing Shot]]_ to make melee attacks with a ranged weapon, if you successfully hit a foe, any ranged attacks you make with the same weapon until the beginning of your next turn do not provoke attacks of opportunity from that foe.

**Special:** If you have the _[[feats/Rapid Reload|Rapid Reload]]_ feat in addition to this feat, your chosen weapon is a crossbow or firearm, that weapon is unloaded, and you successfully hit a foe in melee with it, you can automatically load it as a free action.
