# Touched By Sacred Fire

Regular contact with an elemental _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Guardian|guardian]]_ of the Ruby Prince (such as Khemet's _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ fire elemental cohort Janhelia) has left you able to shrug off many sources of unnatural _[[universal monster rules/Heat|heat]]_, even if the effort required sometimes makes it difficult to defend yourself from attacks.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Endurance|Endurance]]_, _[[npcs/Risen Guard|Risen Guard]]_ rank, _Risen Guard_ 15 TPA.

**Benefit:** You gain fire _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ 5 and a +2 bonus on all saving throws to resist the effects of fire or _heat_. As a swift action, you can increase your fire _resistance_ to 10 and your save bonus to +4 until your next turn; this causes you to lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class until your next turn (which leaves you vulnerable to sneak attacks).
