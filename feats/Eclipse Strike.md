# Eclipse Strike (Teamwork)

A sudden _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_ disorients your foe, leaving it unprotected against your _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Blinding|blinding]]_ attack.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Tiefling|Tiefling]]_, _darkness_ racial spell-like ability.

**Benefit:** You can attack with an _[[feats/Eclipse Strike|eclipse strike]]_ as a standard action if you and an ally who also has this feat are both flanking the target. You and your ally must both have at least one use of your _darkness_ racial spell-like ability available to make this attack. If your _eclipse strike_ hits, your target is _[[conditions/Blinded|blinded]]_ for 1 round. Creatures that have the _[[universal monster rules/See in Darkness|see in darkness]]_ ability are immune to the blindness that is caused by an _eclipse strike_.
