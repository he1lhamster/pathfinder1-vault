# Dragon Ferocity (Combat)

You attack with the strength of a dragon, your telling blows striking _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ into your enemies.

**Prerequisites:** Str 15, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Dragon Style|Dragon Style]]_, _[[feats/Stunning Fist|Stunning Fist]]_, Acrobatics 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** While using _Dragon Style_, increase your Strength bonus on unarmed strike damage rolls by an additional one-half your Strength bonus, to a total of double your Strength bonus on the first attack and 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus on the other attacks. When you score a critical hit or a successful _Stunning Fist_ attempt against an opponent while using this style, that opponent is also _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for a number of rounds equal to 1d4 + your Strength bonus.

**Special:** Taking this feat allows you to qualify for the _[[feats/Elemental Fist|Elemental Fist]]_ feat (Advanced Player's Guide 158) even if you do not meet that feat's prerequisites. If you do not meet that feat's prerequisites, you must choose one of the damage types that feat offers, and you can use only that damage type with your _Elemental Fist_ attacks until you meet the feat's normal prerequisites. A _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ with this feat can use _Elemental Fist_ as if he were a _monk_ of the four winds (Advanced Player's Guide 112).
