# Tatzlwyrm Rake (Combat)

You can immobilize your foe without using your arms.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Tatzlwyrm Claw Style|Tatzlwyrm Claw Style]]_, _[[feats/Tatzlwyrm Grappler|Tatzlwyrm Grappler]]_, Escape Artist 8 ranks.

**Benefit:** While using the _[[monsters/Tatzlwyrm|Tatzlwyrm]]_ Style feat, you can attempt a combat maneuver check to maintain a grapple without using your arms. You must use at least two limbs in order to do this, and if you use all your legs, you can't take any movement while maintaining the grapple. If your combat maneuver check succeeds by 10 or more, you are able to make a single unarmed attack against the target of the grapple as a swift action.
