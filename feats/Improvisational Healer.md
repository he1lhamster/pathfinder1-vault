# Improvisational Healer

In any urban or natural setting, you can scavenge for useful medical supplies.

**Prerequisites:** _[[spells/Heal|Heal]]_ 1 rank.

**Benefit:** When attempting a _Heal_ check that normally requires a _[[items/Mundane/Healer's kit|healer's kit]]_, you don't take a penalty on the check for not having a _healer's kit_. When you use a _healer's kit_, you can augment it with improvised supplies, gaining an additional +2 circumstance bonus on your check. Finally, you can treat any potion of _[[spells/Cure Light Wounds|cure light wounds]]_, potion of _[[spells/Cure Moderate Wounds|cure moderate wounds]]_, or potion of _[[spells/Cure Serious Wounds|cure serious wounds]]_ you drink yourself or administer to another character as though its caster level were equal to the number of ranks you have in the _Heal_ skill. The spell's normal limitations apply; for example, a potion of _cure light wounds_ can cure a maximum of 1d8+5 points of damage, even if you have more than 5 ranks in the _Heal_ skill.
