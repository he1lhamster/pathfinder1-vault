**Prerequisites:** Ability to _[[spells/Awaken|awaken]]_ the _[[spells/Root|root]]_ chakra.

**Benefit:** You gain a pool that holds 3 points of serpent-fire ki, which you can use only to open or maintain chakras. These serpent-fire ki points are replenished at the same time you replenish the points in your regular ki pool.
