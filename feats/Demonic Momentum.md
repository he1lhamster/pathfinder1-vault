# Demonic Momentum (Combat)

You slam into foes with devastating force, leaving them vulnerable to your _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_ strikes.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Demonic Style|Demonic Style]]_*, _[[feats/Improved Bull Rush|Improved Bull Rush]]_, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, base attack bonus +5.

**Benefit:** While using _Demonic Style_, when you successfully bull rush an opponent as part of a charge, you gain a +2 bonus on melee weapon damage rolls against that opponent for every 5 feet it was moved by your bull rush. This bonus lasts until the end of your next turn, and it stacks with the damage bonus granted by _Demonic Style_.
