# Lucid Dreamer

The Dimension of Dreams is open to those willing to risk crossing the threshold.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** You have greater control of the highly morphic qualities and wild magic of the Dimension of Dreams. You gain a +4 bonus on Charisma checks to determine your initial condition when your lucid body (see page 242) enters a _[[spells/Dream|dream]]_ and when attempting impossible feats in a dreamscape, and a +2 bonus on caster level checks to prevent a spell or spell-like ability from going awry because of wild magic. If someone casts a _[[spells/Dream Council|dream council]]_ spell that includes you as a target while you are dreaming, you can enter a shared dreamscape as described in that spell without spending a casting of _dream_ or _dream council_. If your lucid body dies while in a dreamscape, you wake up _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_.
