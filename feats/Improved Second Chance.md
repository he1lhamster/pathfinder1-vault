# Improved Second Chance (Combat)

You can turn a missed strike into a _[[feats/Second Chance|second chance]]_ without sacrificing later attacks.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _Second Chance_, base attack bonus +11.

**Benefit:** When you reroll a missed attack using the _Second Chance_ feat, you can still make the rest of your attacks that turn, albeit at a -5 penalty to each attack.

**Normal:** When using the _Second Chance_ feat, you must normally forgo the rest of your attacks that turn.
