# Mud In Your Eye (Combat)

You are used to fighting in muck and slime, and happily hurl it in your foes' eyes in the _[[universal monster rules/Heat|heat]]_ of battle.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Throw Anything|Throw Anything]]_.

**Benefit:** As a standard action when in urban or subterranean terrain, you can _[[spells/Scoop|scoop]]_ filth, sewage, mud, or similar grime off a nearby surface and hurl it at a foe as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 5 feet. If the attack hits, you can immediately attempt a dirty trickAPG combat maneuver against the target as a free action; this dirty trick can be used only to blind the target. As a ranged touch attack, this action provokes attacks of opportunity, even if your dirty trick attempts normally wouldn't provoke such attacks (such as via the Improved Dirty TrickAPG feat).

**Special:** A character with favored terrain (as the _[[classes/Ranger|ranger]]_ class feature) can use this feat when in any of his favored terrains in addition to urban and subterranean.
