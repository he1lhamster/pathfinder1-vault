# Dance Of Chains (Combat)

In your hands, a _[[items/Weapon/Spiked chain|spiked chain]]_ dances like a living thing.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15, _[[feats/Chain Mastery|Chain Mastery]]_, _[[feats/Exotic Weapon Proficiency|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]]_ (_spiked chain_), _[[feats/Weapon Finesse|Weapon Finesse]]_, Perform (dance) 1 rank.

**Benefit:** When wielding a _spiked chain_ one-handed, you can add your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to that weapon's damage. The _spiked chain_ must be one appropriate for your size. During your turn, you treat your reach with the _spiked chain_ as 5 feet greater. You lose these benefits while fighting with multiple weapons or when using a _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ (but not when using a _[[items/Armor/Buckler|buckler]]_).
