# Life's Blood

Your blood flows with eternal life, and its healing powers allow you use your blood to _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ others.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Samsaran|Samsaran]]_.

**Benefit:** At will as a full-round action, you may perform a special _[[feats/Bloodletting|bloodletting]]_ ritual through which you _[[spells/Sacrifice|sacrifice]]_ some of your own vitality to _heal_ another creature. When using this feat, you take 1d4 points of damage and apply your blood to the wounds of a living creature, healing it for a number of hit points equal to the amount of damage you took from the ritual. This is a supernatural ability. Only you can perform this _bloodletting_. A creature cannot be healed by this ability more than once per day.
