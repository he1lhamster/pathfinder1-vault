# Field Repair

You can repair your _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ weapon or armor to serviceability even without the benefits of artisan tools.

**Prerequisites:** Craft 4 ranks.

**Benefit:** If you are trained in a Craft skill appropriate to a _broken_ item, you can repair that item with no raw material cost and no penalty on your Craft skill check for using improvised tools. If you spend a day, the item regains 1 hit point plus one-quarter of its original hit points. Alternatively, if the item gained the _broken_ condition because it is a firearm that has misf ired or a siege engine that suffered a mishap, or has the _broken_ condition because it has the fragile weapon quality (or some similar quality), you can make a Craft check with the DC it takes to craft that item (see Table 2-2, below). If the check succeeds, the item loses the _broken_ condition.

**Normal:** Improvised tools impose a -2 penalty on Craft checks. Items require raw materials to repair.
