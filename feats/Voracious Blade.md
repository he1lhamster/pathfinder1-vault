# Voracious Blade (Combat)

You can channel your daemonic energies through the vile blade you wield.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_[[items/Weapon/Rhoka sword|rhoka sword]]_), base attack bonus +4, _[[monsters/Urdefhan|urdefhan]]_.

**Benefit:** When wielding a _rhoka sword_, you can channel your daemonic energies through the blade as a swift action, causing it to deal Strength damage as your bite attack. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1).
