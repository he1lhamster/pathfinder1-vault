# Focused Magical Beast Expertise (Combat)

You move in ways that confound creatures that would strike you repeatedly.

**Prerequisites:** Favored enemy (magical beast) class feature.

**Benefit:** If a creature makes three or more attacks with natural weapons against you during its turn, you gain partial cover against the third and subsequent _[[universal monster rules/Natural Attacks|natural attacks]]_ from that creature. If the creature makes five or more attacks against you with natural weapons, you gain cover (instead of partial cover) against the fifth and subsequent _natural attacks_. If the attacker is a magical beast, reduce by one the number of _natural attacks_ it must make in order for you to gain cover or partial cover.
