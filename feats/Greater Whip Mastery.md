# Greater Whip Mastery (Combat)

You can use a _[[items/Weapon/Whip|whip]]_ to make combat maneuvers with ease.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved _Whip_ Mastery|Improved _Whip_ Mastery]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_whip_), _[[feats/Whip Mastery|Whip Mastery]]_, base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit:** You are so quick with your _whip_ that you never drop it due to a failed disarm or _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ combat maneuver attempt. Further, you gain the ability to grapple using your _whip_. To do so, use the normal grapple rules with the following changes. 
Attack: You cannot use your _whip_ to attack while you are using it to grapple an opponent. 
Damage: When dealing damage to your _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ opponent, you deal your _whip_'s weapon damage rather than your unarmed strike damage. 
Free Hands: You take no penalty on your combat maneuver check for having fewer than two hands free when you use your _whip_ to grapple. 
Reach: Rather than pulling your _grappled_ opponent adjacent to you when you successfully grapple and when you move the grapple, you must keep him within your _whip_'s reach minus his own reach to maintain the grapple. If the difference in reach is less than 0, such as is the case for a _[[classes/Medium|Medium]]_ _whip_ wielder and a Gargantuan creature, you cannot grapple that opponent with your _whip_. If you have to _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ a creature adjacent to you to grapple it with your _whip_, you still provoke an attack of opportunity from that opponent unless you have the _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_ feat. 
Tie Up: While adjacent to your opponent, you can attempt to use your _whip_ to tie him up. If you do so to an opponent you have _grappled_ rather than _[[conditions/Pinned|pinned]]_, you take only a -5 penalty on the combat maneuver check rather than the normal -10.
