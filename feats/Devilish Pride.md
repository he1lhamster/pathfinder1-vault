# Devilish Pride

Your pride allows no master but Asmodeus.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Iron Will|Iron Will]]_, worshiper of Asmodeus.

**Benefit:** Whenever you attempt a Will save against a charm or compulsion spell cast by anyone who is not a worshiper of Asmodeus, you may roll twice and take the better result.
