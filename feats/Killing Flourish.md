# Killing Flourish (Combat)

You inspire dread in other foes when you slay an enemy.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Intimidating Prowess|Intimidating Prowess]]_, Intimidate 4 ranks, _[[classes/Slayer|slayer]]_ level 4th.

**Benefit:** When you reduce your target to below 0 hit points with a melee attack, as a swift action you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all foes within 30 feet who can see your attack.
