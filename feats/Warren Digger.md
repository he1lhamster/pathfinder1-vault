# Warren Digger

After years spent digging up graves, you are able to move through dirt almost as easily as a fish through water.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Ghoul|Ghoul]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain a _[[universal monster rules/Burrow|burrow]]_ speed of 10 feet through earth, sand, or soil.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take it, add 10 feet to your _burrow_ speed, up to a maximum of your base land speed.
