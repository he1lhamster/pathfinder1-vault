# Weapon Trick (Combat)

Choose one _[[feats/Weapon Trick|weapon trick]]_ option (one-handed weapon, polearm, ranged, two-handed weapon, two-weapon, or weapon and _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_). You can perform weapon tricks in combat when armed appropriately for that option.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** You can use any weapon tricks relating to the chosen weapon option if you meet the trick's prerequisites and are proficient with any weapon or _shield_ that you use as part of the trick.

**Special:** You can gain _Weapon Trick_ multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new _weapon trick_ option.
