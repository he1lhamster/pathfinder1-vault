# Focused Ooze Expertise (Combat)

You've learned to avoid and overcome the engulfing attacks of your studied prey.

**Prerequisites:** Favored enemy (ooze) class feature.

**Benefit:** You gain a bonus to your CMD equal to half your favored enemy (ooze) bonus. You also gain acid _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ equal to half your favored enemy (ooze) bonus. Against oozes, you instead apply your full favored enemy (ooze) bonus for both benefits.
