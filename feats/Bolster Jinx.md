# Bolster Jinx

Your ability to resist certain effects somehow makes it even harder for creatures you jinx to do the same.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Great Fortitude|Great Fortitude]]_, _[[feats/Iron Will|Iron Will]]_, or _[[feats/Lightning Reflexes|Lightning Reflexes]]_; Halfling Jinx trait.

**Benefit:** A jinxed target's penalty on Fortitude, Reflex, or Will saves increases by 2 if you have the _Great Fortitude_, _Lightning Reflexes_, or _Iron Will_ feat, respectively. If you have more than one of these feats, the additional penalties apply to all of the corresponding saves.
