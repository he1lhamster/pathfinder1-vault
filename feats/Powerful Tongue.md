# Powerful Tongue

Unlike others of your kind, you are able to _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ your prey toward yourself.

**Prerequisites:** Str 17, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sticky|sticky]]_ tongue.

**Benefit:** Your tongue attack gains the _pull_ special ability. At the start of your turn, if your tongue is attached to a target of your size or smaller and you succeed at a combat maneuver check, you can _pull_ the target 5 feet closer to you as free action.
