# Ki Diversity (Combat)

You have trained at the feet of the masters of the Kusari- Gama, a secret society of _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ warriors. With their secrets you have mastered new ways to apply your ki.

**Prerequisites:** Ki pool class feature, Wis 13, Kusari-Gama 25 TPA.

**Benefit:** You learn how to channel your ki in a new ability. Choose one of the following ki powers: Bone Crusher: When you succeed at a _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ or disarm combat maneuver, you may spend 1 point from your ki pool as a swift action to deal damage to your opponent as if you had hit them with an unarmed strike. 
Dim Mak: You may spend 1 point from your ki pool as a swift action to execute your next _[[feats/Stunning Fist|Stunning Fist]]_ attack as a melee touch attack rather than a normal melee attack. 
Mind of the Kensai: You may spend 1 point from your ki pool as a swift action to imbue a single melee weapon in your hands with the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Ki Focus|ki focus]]_ weapon special ability until your next turn. 
Wings of the Crane: If you have the _[[feats/Deflect Arrows|Deflect Arrows]]_ feat, you may spend 1 point from your ki pool as an immediate action to use that feat to deflect a second missile weapon that round. If you have the _[[feats/Snatch Arrows|Snatch Arrows]]_ feat, you may use this ability to catch a second weapon, but not throw it back. 
Zen Combatant: You may spend 1 point from your ki pool as a swift action to substitute your Wisdom score for your Strength or Dexterity for all melee or ranged attacks you make that round.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, you may choose an additional ability from the list above. Monks can select this feat as a _monk_ bonus feat.
