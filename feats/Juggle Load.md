# Juggle Load (Combat)

Your fingers are so nimble that reloading your _[[items/Weapon/Sling|sling]]_ is almost effortless for you.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Ammo Drop|Ammo Drop]]_, Sleight of Hand 1 rank, proficient with _sling_.

**Benefit:** You can load a _sling_ or double _sling_ as a free action. This does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This feat allows you to fire your _sling_ as many times in a fullattack action as you could attack if you were using a bow.
