# Hindrance Dismissal

You've mastered the art of dismissing certain spells when they become a problem for you or your allies.

**Benefit:** You can dismiss any pit spell (such as create pitAPG, hungry pitAPG, spiked pitAPG, and similar spells with "pit" in their names) or wall spell (such as _[[spells/Wall Of Fire|wall of fire]]_, _[[spells/Wall Of Ice|wall of ice]]_, and similar spells with "wall" in their names) you cast. The spells must have a duration of at least 1 round. This ability follows the normal rules for dismissing spells, allowing you to dismiss conjured pits and walls as a standard action.

**Normal:** Several pit and wall spells cannot be dismissed without the use of this feat.
