# Intuitive Spell (Metamagic)

You can avoid the need for thought components by trusting your instincts.

**Benefit:** An _[[feats/Intuitive Spell|intuitive spell]]_ can be cast with no thought components. Spells without thought components are not affected. An _intuitive spell_ uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.
