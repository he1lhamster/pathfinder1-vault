# Seeds Ofdoubt

You have learned to plant the seeds of your own doubt in the minds of others by way of your hexes.

**Prerequisites:** Hex class feature,_[[feats/Divine Defiance|Divine Defiance]]_.

**Benefit:** As long as a creature is subject to one of your hexes, it gains a +1 luck bonus on Will saving throws and can't help but doubt and resist divine magic. Whenever an affected creature is subject to a divine spell or spell-like ability granted by a divine spellcasting class, that creature must attempt a saving throw if at all possible, even if the effect is harmless, cast by an ally, or cast by the creature itself.
