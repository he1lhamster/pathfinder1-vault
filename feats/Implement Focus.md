# Implement Focus

You are more adept at spending generic focus on focus powers from your chosen school.

**Prerequisites:** _[[classes/Occultist|Occultist]]_ level 3rd.

**Benefit:** Select one of your implement schools. When you spend generic focus to activate focus powers with one of that school's implements, the focus powers cost their listed amount of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Mental Focus|mental focus]]_.

**Normal:** Any focus power activated with generic focus costs twice as much focus to use and maintain.

**Special:** You can take this feat multiple times. Each time, you must select a different implement school.
