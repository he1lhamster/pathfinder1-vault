# Lifeless Gaze

Your cold visage and eyes devoid of sentiment _[[spells/Cause Fear|cause fear]]_ in those making contact with your _[[universal monster rules/Gaze|gaze]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Iron Will|Iron Will]]_, Bluff 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** Your haunting _gaze_ grants horrifying insights to the darker places of your inner psyche. You gain a +2 insight bonus on Will saving throws against emotionUM effects and a +2 insight bonus on Bluff checks. Additionally, if a humanoid creature attempts to read your mind using an ability like _[[spells/Detect Thoughts|detect thoughts]]_, it is _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 2d4 rounds regardless of whether the mind-reading attempt succeeds. If a humanoid fails a Diplomacy check against you by 5 or more, it becomes _shaken_ for 2d4 rounds by your emotionless _gaze_.
