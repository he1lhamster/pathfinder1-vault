# Gorgon's Fist (Combat)

With one well-placed blow, you leave your target reeling.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Scorpion Style|Scorpion Style]]_, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, make a single unarmed melee attack against a foe whose speed is reduced (such as from _Scorpion Style_). If the attack hits, you deal damage normally and the target is _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ until the end of your next turn unless it makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier). This feat has no effect on targets that are _staggered_.
