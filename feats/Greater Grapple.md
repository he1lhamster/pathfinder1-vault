# Greater Grapple (Combat)

Maintaining a grapple is second nature to you.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +6, Dex 13.

**Benefit:** You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to grapple a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by _Improved Grapple_. Once you have _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ a creature, maintaining the grapple is a move action. This feat allows you to make two grapple checks each round (to move, _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_, or pin your opponent), but you are not required to make two checks. You only need to succeed at one of these checks to maintain the grapple.

**Normal:** Maintaining a grapple is a standard action.
