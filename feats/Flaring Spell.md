# Flaring Spell (Metamagic)

You dazzle creatures when you affect them with a spell that has the fire, light, or electricity descriptor.

**Benefit:** The electricity, fire, or light effects of the affected spell create a flaring that dazzles creatures that take damage from the spell. A _[[spells/Flare|flare]]_ spell causes a creature that takes fire or electricity damage from the affected spell to become _[[conditions/Dazzled|dazzled]]_ for a number of rounds equal to the actual level of the spell. A _[[feats/Flaring Spell|flaring spell]]_ only affects spells with a fire, light, or electricity descriptor. A _flaring spell_ uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
