# Blighted Critical Mastery

You control the type of spellblight your critical hits give your opponent.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Blighted Critical|Blighted Critical]]_, caster level 9th.

**Benefit:** Whenever you apply a spellblight by way of the _Blighted Critical_ or _[[feats/Greater Blighted Critical|Greater Blighted critical]]_ feat, you can choose the spellblight you apply rather than determining it randomly.
