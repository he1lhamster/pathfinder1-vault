# Sirian's Masterstroke (Combat)

When bypassing a foe's defenses while feinting, you can deal devastating damage.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Exotic Weapon Proficiency|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]]_ (_[[items/Weapon/Aldori _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Dueling|dueling]]_ sword|Aldori _dueling_ sword]]_), _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_Aldori _dueling_ sword_), base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** Once per round when you hit a foe you have successfully feinted against via a melee attack using an _Aldori _dueling_ sword_, you deal an extra 2d6 points of precision damage. When your base attack bonus reaches +11, this damage bonus increases to +3d6, and at base attack bonus +16, it increases to +4d6. This precision damage does not stack with damage from sneak attack, a _[[classes/Vigilante|vigilante]]_'s sudden strike, or similar effects. Any effect which protects against sneak attack damage also protects against this additional damage.
