# Overwhelming Phantom

Your phantom is strong-willed, allowing it to enter and dominate other creature's minds.

**Prerequisites:** Phantom class feature, _[[classes/Spiritualist|spiritualist]]_ level 15th.

**Benefit:** Three times per day, as a standard action while it is fully manifested, your phantom can attempt to enter and take control of a living creature; doing so provokes an attack of opportunity. A creature can resist this inf luence with a successful Will save (DC = 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier). A phantom can maintain this control for 1 minute per _spiritualist_ level you have, but the victim is allowed a new saving throw each minute. This ability otherwise functions as greater possessionOA.
