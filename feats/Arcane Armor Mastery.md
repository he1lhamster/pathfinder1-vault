# Arcane Armor Mastery (Combat)

You have mastered the ability to cast spells while wearing armor.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Arcane Armor Training|Arcane Armor Training]]_, _[[feats/Medium Armor Proficiency|Medium Armor Proficiency]]_, caster level 7th.

**Benefit:** As a swift action, reduce the arcane spell failure chance due to the armor you are wearing by 20% for any spells you cast this round. This bonus replaces, and does not stack with, the bonus granted by _Arcane Armor Training_.
