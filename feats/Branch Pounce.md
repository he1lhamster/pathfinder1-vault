# Branch Pounce (Combat)

You are adept at climbing trees and using the higher ground to your advantage in battle.

**Prerequisites:** Climb 3 ranks, Stealth 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** When charging a target by jumping down from above (such as when jumping out of a tree), you can soften your own fall with a melee attack. If the attack at the end of your charge hits, the attack deals damage as normal and also adds the appropriate amount of falling damage (1d6 points for a 10-foot fall, 2d6 points for a 20-foot fall, and so on). This falling damage is not multiplied on a critical hit. You land in an unoccupied square of your choosing adjacent to the target, and you take falling damage as if you had _[[monsters/Fallen|fallen]]_ 10 fewer feet. You can attempt an Acrobatics check as normal to treat the fall as an additional 10 feet shorter for the purpose of determining the damage you take from the fall and treat the first 1d6 points of damage you take from the fall as nonlethal damage. If your attack misses, you land _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ in a random square adjacent to the target and automatically take the full amount of falling damage.
