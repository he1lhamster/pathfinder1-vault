# Dolphin Dart (Combat)

Like a _[[monsters/Dolphin|dolphin]]_, you can quickly _[[items/Weapon/Dart|dart]]_ at a foe and retreat.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Dolphin Style|Dolphin Style]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, Swim 6 ranks, base attack bonus +6 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 6th.

**Benefit:** While in _Dolphin Style_, as a standard action _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_ you can move up to half your swim speed, make a single melee attack against a creature within your reach, and then retreat back to your previous position. Your movement and attack don't provoke attacks of opportunity, even if your foe has an ability that allows attacks of opportunity with triggers other than moving out of a threatened area.
