# Spell Bluff

You know the principles of arcane _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Dueling|dueling]]_, and when fighting other spellcasters, you have learned to hide the true nature of your spells until the last possible moment.

**Prerequisites:** Bluff 5 ranks, Spellcraft 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** If another spellcaster tries to counterspell your casting, she adds +4 to her Spellcraft DC when trying to determine your spell. Because you have studied how to _[[items/Mundane/Mask|mask]]_ the recognizable elements of your spellcasting, you gain a +2 bonus on your Spellcraft checks to _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ and counter an opponent's spell if it is a spell you know or have in your _[[items/Mundane/Spellbook|spellbook]]_.
