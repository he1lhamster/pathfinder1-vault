# Baneful Judgment (Combat)

You dole out judgment to a particular foe.

**Prerequisites:** BaneAPG class feature, judgmentAPG class feature, monster loreAPG class feature.

**Benefit:** You can declare a specialized judgment against a creature as a swift action. When pronouncing this judgment, you attempt a Knowledge check to _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ the creature, or refer to your previous result if you've already identified the creature. If you succeed at the check or have already identified the creature, you can spend 1 round of _[[spells/Bane|bane]]_ and choose one judgment other than the healing judgment. You gain the benefits of this judgment against that creature for only 1 round plus 1 additional round for every 5 by which you exceeded the DC to _identify_ the target. Subsequent uses of this judgment do not stack with this ability. A creature cannot be the target of this ability again for 24 hours.
