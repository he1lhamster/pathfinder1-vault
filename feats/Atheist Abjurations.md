# Atheist Abjurations

Your critical attitude toward the divine allows you to determine the best ways to remove divine inf luence.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Divine Defiance|Divine Defiance]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus to your caster level whenever you use an abjuration spell to dispel or counter a divine spell, or send an extraplanar outsider summoned or called by a divine caster back to its home plane.
