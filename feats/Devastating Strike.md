# Devastating Strike (Combat)

Pitting all of your strength and resolve against your enemy, you deliver a strike that is impossible to ignore.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Vital Strike|Vital Strike]]_, base attack bonus +9.

**Benefit:** Whenever you use _Vital Strike_, _[[feats/Improved Vital Strike|Improved Vital Strike]]_, or _[[feats/Greater Vital Strike|Greater Vital Strike]]_, you gain a +2 bonus on each extra weapon damage dice roll those feats grant (+6 maximum). This bonus damage is multiplied on a critical hit.
