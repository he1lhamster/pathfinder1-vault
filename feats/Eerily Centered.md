# Eerily Centered

Little can shake your _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Peaceful|peaceful]]_ temperament.

**Prerequisites:** Bleachling racial trait, gnome.

**Benefit:** You gain a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and effects with the emotionUM descriptor. Effects with the _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ descriptor or that grant you a morale bonus affect you for only half the normal duration (minimum 1 round), and such effects that you can activate on yourself (such as a _[[classes/Barbarian|barbarian]]_'s _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_) require you to _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ daily uses or rounds of those abilities at twice the normal rate.
