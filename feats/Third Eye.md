# Third Eye

You possess and can open a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Third Eye|third eye]]_ that permits you to see things as they really are and gain greater insight into auras.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Psychic Sensitivity|Psychic Sensitivity]]_ or ability to cast _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ spells.

**Benefit:** Once per day as a standard action, you can open a spiritual _third eye_ positioned on your forehead between and above your normal eyes. You can keep this eye open for up to 1 minute per character level you possess. This duration doesn't have to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. Once per day while your _third eye_ is open, you can use the read aura occult skill unlock after 1 minute of intense concentration. This is in addition to the normal daily use of read aura (which still takes 10 minutes). While your _third eye_ is open, you gain a +4 bonus on Perception checks to read auras, as well as a +8 bonus on Perception checks to detect _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ creatures or objects or see through magical disguises (both illusory ones and those provided by the _[[universal monster rules/Change Shape|change shape]]_ ability or _[[spells/Polymorph|polymorph]]_ magic). When you close your _third eye_, either voluntarily or at the end of the time limit, you are _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_ for an amount of time equal to the length of time you kept your _third eye_ open.

**Normal:** Without this feat, you must spend 10 minutes in intense concentration to read one of a creature or item's four auras, and you can do so only once per day.

**Special:** You can take this feat multiple times. Its effects don't stack. Each time you take the feat, you increase the number of times per day you can open your _third eye_ (and read an aura) by one.
