# Demonic Slaughter (Combat)

You punch into your foes' ranks and cut them down.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Cleave|Cleave]]_, _[[feats/Demonic Momentum|Demonic Momentum]]_*, _[[feats/Demonic Style|Demonic Style]]_*, _[[feats/Great Cleave|Great Cleave]]_, _[[feats/Improved Bull Rush|Improved Bull Rush]]_, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, base attack bonus +9.

**Benefit:** While using _Demonic Style_, when you successfully bull rush an opponent as part of a charge, you can immediately use _Great Cleave_ as though you had used a standard action to do so. This occurs after the effect of your bull rush is fully resolved. The target of your bull rush must be the target of the first attack you make as part of _Great Cleave_.
