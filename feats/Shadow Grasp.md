# Shadow Grasp (Metamagic)

Your _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_ spells have substance and bind your foes.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Tenebrous Spell|Tenebrous Spell]]_, _[[feats/Umbral Spell|Umbral Spell]]_.

**Benefit:** When you cast a spell with the _darkness_ descriptor that affects an area, creatures in the area are _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the _[[spells/Entangle|entangle]]_ effect. If the spell does not normally allow a save, a creature can make a Reflex save (DC = the spell's DC if it had a saving throw) to negate the effect. If the spell allows _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_, failing to overcome a creature's _spell resistance_ means it is not _entangled_. An _entangled_ creature remains so as long as it is in the area of the spell and for 1 round after it leaves. A creature that leaves and reenters the area must make a new saving throw to avoid becoming _entangled_. Creatures that succeed at a save to resist being _entangled_ do not have to make additional saves if they stay within the darkened area. You are never impeded by the effects of your spells modified by this feat. A _[[feats/Shadow Grasp|Shadow Grasp]]_ spell uses up a slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
