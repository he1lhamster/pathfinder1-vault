# Djinni Spin (Combat)

You can surround yourself with the power of the storm, spinning like a hurricane to unleash a violent blast of electrical energy.

**Prerequisites:** Con 15, Wis 17, _[[feats/Djinni Style|Djinni Style]]_, _[[feats/Djinni Spirit|Djinni Spirit]]_, _[[feats/Elemental Fist|Elemental Fist]]_**, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +13 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 11th.

**Benefit:** While using _Djinni Style_, as a standard action you can spend two _Elemental Fist_ (Advanced Player's Guide 158) attempts to surround yourself with a _[[universal monster rules/Whirlwind|whirlwind]]_ of electrified air. Creatures adjacent to you take your unarmed strike damage plus the electricity damage from your _Elemental Fist_ and are _[[conditions/Deafened|deafened]]_ for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from being _deafened_.
