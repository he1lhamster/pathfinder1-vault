# Esoteric Evocation (Esoteric)

Entropic resin flares from your hand when you use it for an evocation spell, striking a nearby foe.

**Benefit:** When you cast an evocation spell using entropic resin as an esoteric material component, you can damage one creature adjacent to you. The resin deals 1 point of damage per 2 caster levels of the spell (minimum 1), and matches the damage type of your spell. When you gain entropic resin's greater component effect with an evocation spell, treat your caster level as an additional 1 higher for determining both the damage dice of the spell and the extra damage from _[[feats/Esoteric Evocation|Esoteric Evocation]]_. This also increases the spell's maximum damage dice if applicable.
