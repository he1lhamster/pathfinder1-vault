# Draconic Manifestation

You've unlocked more than just the ability to emulate the claws of your draconic forebear. You now invoke other traits of your bloodline.

**Prerequisites:** Access to natural claw attacks, _[[classes/Bloodrager|bloodrager]]_ or _[[classes/Sorcerer|sorcerer]]_ with the draconic bloodline.

**Benefit:** As a free action when manifesting claws (as per the _sorcerer_ bloodline ability), you infuse yourself with other dormant powers of your draconic bloodline. If you're a _bloodrager_, you gain the benefits of this feat as a free action, but only while bloodraging; the ability lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. These rounds need not be used consecutively. Depending on the specific draconic bloodline you have, you gain one of the following abilities. 
Chromatic: You become immune to _[[universal monster rules/Paralysis|paralysis]]_ and sleep effects. 
Esoteric: You become partially _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_, gaining concealment (20%) against all incoming attacks. 
Imperial: You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks for every 4 levels you have in a class that grants you a draconic bloodline. You also become immune to _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effects. 
Metallic: You radiate a 10-foot aura of courage, inspiring those around you with your intensity. Allies within the aura gain a +2 morale bonus on saves against _fear_ effects and spells with the evil descriptor. Allies already affected by a _fear_ effect when they first enter the aura can attempt a new saving throw at the same DC as the original effect. On a successful save, the _fear_ effect ends. A creature can benefit from this reroll only once per day. 
Outer: You don't need to breathe and gain _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to any gas-based or smell effects. 
Primal: You radiate a 5-foot aura of elemental damage. Creatures within the aura take 1 point of damage for every 4 levels you have in a class that grants you a draconic bloodline. This damage is energy damage based on your chosen dragon type.
