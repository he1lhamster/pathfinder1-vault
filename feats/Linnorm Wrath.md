# Linnorm Wrath (Combat)

With practiced ease, you answer a blow with a blow. Even when you are overwhelmed, your body deflects the force of the _[[feats/Strike Back|strike back]]_ to the attacker as a stunning wave of energy.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 13, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Linnorm Style|Linnorm Style]]_, _[[feats/Linnorm Vengeance|Linnorm Vengeance]]_, base attack bonus +9 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 9th.

**Benefit:** When you use the _Linnorm Vengeance_ feat to allow an enemy to hit you, you can make a retaliatory unarmed strike attack against that opponent as an immediate action. This acts as an attack of opportunity, and counts against the number of attacks of opportunity you can make each round. Additionally, once per day when a melee attack deals enough damage to _[[spells/Knock|knock]]_ you _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_ or kill you, the attacker must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier) or be _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_ for 1 round. This save occurs after you make the retaliatory unarmed strike granted by the _Linnorm Vengeance_ feat.
