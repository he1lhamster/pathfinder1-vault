# Sinister Reputation

You need spook only a few souls to _[[spells/Scare|scare]]_ a whole city.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13; Intimidate 5 ranks; _[[feats/Persuasive|Persuasive]]_ or _[[feats/Renown|renown]]_ social talentUI.

**Benefit:** By spending 8 hours cultivating your local legend in a settlement and then succeeding at an Intimidate check, your fearsome reputation becomes common knowledge. The DC is based on the size of the settlement (see the _[[feats/Sinister Reputation|Sinister Reputation]]_ table below and page 203 of Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide). If the check succeeds, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than you as a swift action, and using Intimidate to force a creature to act friendly to you takes only half as long. You gain these benefits only while within the settlement and while not disguised. These benefits last for a number of days equal to your half your level + your Charisma modifier.

**Special:** This feat's benefits always apply to a _[[classes/Vigilante|vigilante]]_'sUI area of _renown_, and he can choose whether the reputation and benefits apply to his social identity, _vigilante_ identity, or both. You can always apply this feat's benefits to followers and cohorts gained from _[[feats/Leadership|Leadership]]_ or similar abilities.
