# Guarded Charge (Shield Mastery)

Your raised _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ protects you as you charge forward.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Shield Focus|Shield Focus]]_, base attack bonus +6 or _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_ level 4th.

**Benefit:** When performing a bull rush or overrun combat maneuver as part of a charge, you don't provoke an attack of opportunity for that maneuver. If you already have the _[[feats/Improved Bull Rush|Improved Bull Rush]]_ or _[[feats/Improved Overrun|Improved Overrun]]_ feats, you gain an additional +2 bonus on your combat maneuver check when attempting the respective maneuver.

**Special:** This feat counts as having a Strength score of 13 and _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_ for the purposes of meeting the prerequisites of _Improved Bull Rush_ and _Improved Overrun_, and for feats that require either of those two feats as prerequisites.
