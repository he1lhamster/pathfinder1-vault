# Monkey Style (Combat, Style)

Your unarmed fighting style is nimble and unpredictable, full of ground rolls and short leaps.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 13, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, Acrobatics 5 ranks, Climb 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** You add your Wisdom bonus on Acrobatics checks. While using this style, you take no penalty on melee attack rolls or to AC while _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_. Further, you can crawl and stand up from lying _prone_ without provoking attacks of opportunity, and you can stand up as a swift action if you succeed at a DC 20 Acrobatics check.

**Normal:** You take a -4 penalty on attack rolls and AC against melee attacks while _prone_. Standing up is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
