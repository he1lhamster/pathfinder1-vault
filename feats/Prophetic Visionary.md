# Prophetic Visionary

Your oracular abilities give you a glimpse into the future.

**Prerequisites:** Mystery class feature.

**Benefit:** Once per day, you can enter a deep trance to receive a _[[spells/Vision|vision]]_ of the future. The trance lasts for 10 minutes, during which time you can take no other actions. If you are interrupted, you must begin again. When you come out of the trance, you know whether a particular action in the immediate future will bring good or bad results, as an _[[spells/Augury|augury]]_ spell with a 70% chance of success.
