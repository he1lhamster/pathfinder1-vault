# Fey Foundling

You were found in the wilds as a child, bearing a mark of the First World.

**Prerequisites:** You may only select this feat at 1st level.

**Benefit:** Your strange connection to the First World and the fey infuses you with life, and whenever you receive magical healing, you _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ an additional 2 points per die rolled. You gain a +2 bonus on all saving throws against death effects. Unfortunately, you also suffer +1 point of damage from cold iron weapons (although you can wield cold iron weapons without significant discomfort).
