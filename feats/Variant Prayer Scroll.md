# Variant Prayer Scroll

You have learned the secret to changing the powers granted by your _[[spells/Prayer|prayer]]_ scroll.

**Prerequisites:** Jiang-shi.

**Benefit:** You gain the ability to create a different type of _prayer_ scroll. You may create a _prayer_ scroll with this ability by using any strip of parchment and a writing instrument, but doing so requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted work. Swapping your current _prayer_ scroll for a different prepared one is a standard action. When wearing a different _prayer_ scroll, you gain its special abilities, but lose your normal _prayer_ scroll's _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to spell completion and spell trigger magic items. Your _prayer_ scrolls can be used only by you, and have no effect when used by other jiang-shis. When you choose this feat, select one of the following _prayer_ scroll types. 
Embalmed Form: This _prayer_ scroll alters your physical form to how you looked 1 day before your death. Treat this as an _[[spells/Alter Self|alter self]]_ spell that affects you regardless of your original or current type; your caster level is equal to your Hit Dice. Your speed increases by 10 feet, but you lose your _immunity_ to _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ attacks and your ability to move through difficult terrain unhindered. These effects persist indefinitely as long as you wear the _prayer_ scroll, but end immediately if you use a different _prayer_ scroll or 24 hours after you remove this _prayer_ scroll. 
Enduring Dust: If you crumble into dust from hit point damage, you reform after 1 round instead of 1 minute. Scattering your dust does not prevent you from reforming as long none of your dust is more than 30 feet from any other part of your dust. Storing a portion of your dust in an air-tight container prevents you from reforming. If you are unable to reform after 1 minute, you are destroyed. 
Positive Energy _Immunity_: You become immune to positive channeled energy used to _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ undead. This does not protect you against positive energy from other sources such as cure spells or lay on hands. 
_[[spells/Spell Immunity|Spell Immunity]]_: The _prayer_ scroll grants you _immunity_ to a spell, as if you were using _spell immunity_. You decide which spell when you create the _prayer_ scroll, and can choose a different spell each time you create a new _spell immunity_ _prayer_ scroll. If you have 15 or more Hit Dice, this functions as greater _spell immunity_. Creating this type of _prayer_ scroll costs 100 gp x the spell level of the spell keyed to the scroll.

**Special:** You may select this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, choose another ability granted by the feat.
