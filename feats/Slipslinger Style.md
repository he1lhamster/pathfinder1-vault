**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on damage rolls made with all types of slings, and don't provoke attacks of opportunity when reloading a _sling_. In addition, you treat all ranged and thrown weapons that have "_sling_" in their name as if they were slings for all feats and class abilities that require such weapons, as well as the warslinger racial trait.
