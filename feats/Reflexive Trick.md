# Reflexive Trick (Trick)

You are able to implant tricks in yourself in the _[[spells/Blink|blink]]_ of an eye.

**Prerequisites:** _[[classes/Mesmerist|Mesmerist]]_ tricks class feature.

**Benefit:** Whenever the triggering condition for one _mesmerist_ trick that you have not implanted in yourself occurs, you can implant that trick in yourself as an immediate action. You can then immediately trigger the _mesmerist_ trick as if it were implanted in you when the triggering condition occurred. You can't use this ability if you have already implanted the maximum number of _mesmerist_ tricks in yourself.
