# Whip Mastery (Combat)

Your superior expertise with this weapon does not provoke attacks of opportunity from your enemies.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_[[items/Weapon/Whip|whip]]_), base attack bonus +2.

**Benefit:** You no longer provoke attacks of opportunity when attacking with a _whip_. You can deal lethal damage with a _whip_, although you can still deal nonlethal damage when you want. Further, you can deal damage with a _whip_ despite a creature's armor bonus or natural armor bonus.

**Normal:** Attacking with a _whip_ provokes attacks of opportunity as if you used a ranged weapon. A _whip_ deals no damage to a creature that has an armor bonus of +1 or natural armor bonus of +3.
