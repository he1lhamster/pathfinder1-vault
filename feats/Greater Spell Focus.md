# Greater Spell Focus

Choose a school of magic to which you have already applied the _[[feats/Spell Focus|Spell Focus]]_ feat. Any spells you cast of this school are very hard to resist.

**Prerequisites:** _Spell Focus_.

**Benefit:** Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against spells from the school of magic you select. This bonus stacks with the bonus from _Spell Focus_.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new school to which you already have applied the _Spell Focus_ feat.
