# Hydraulic Maneuver

You can use your _[[spells/Hydraulic Push|hydraulic push]]_ to disarm or _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _Hydraulic push_ spell-like ability, _[[monsters/Undine|undine]]_.

**Benefit:** You may use _hydraulic push_ to attempt a bull rush, disarm, dirty trick (blind or dazzle, see Advanced Player's Guide), or _trip_ combat maneuver. Each time you use _hydraulic push_, you must decide which of the allowed combat maneuvers you want to perform. You may use this feat with your _hydraulic push_ racial spell-like ability, your class-granted use of _hydraulic push_, or any _hydraulic push_ spells you cast, but not with magic items or other external sources that use that spell.

**Normal:** _Hydraulic push_ can only be used to make a bull rush combat maneuver.
