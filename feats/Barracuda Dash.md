# Barracuda Dash (Combat)

You use powerful, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ bursts of speed to charge and attack an additional foe.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 13, _[[feats/Barracuda Slam|Barracuda Slam]]_, _[[feats/Barracuda Style|Barracuda Style]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, Acrobatics 7 ranks, Swim 7 ranks.

**Benefit:** You gain a swim speed equal to your base speed. When you attack on a charge in water or on land and the attack hits, you can immediately make a second charge attack against a second opponent. All the normal requirements for making a charge, such as moving at least 10 feet and moving in a straight line, apply to this second attack. The total distance of the two charge attacks cannot exceed the normal maximum distance for a charge (usually double your speed). The movement, including leaving the first target's threatened area, provokes attacks of opportunity as normally. You cannot use _[[universal monster rules/Pounce|pounce]]_ or other abilities that grant extra attacks on your turn if you use _[[feats/Barracuda Dash|Barracuda Dash]]_ to make a second attack.
