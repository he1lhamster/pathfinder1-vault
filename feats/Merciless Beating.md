# Merciless Beating (Combat)

When you have the numbers on your side, you can lend your strength to the group to give your shared enemy a savage pummeling.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, Gang UpAPG.

**Benefit:** Whenever you and two or more allies threaten an opponent, you can choose to forgo your flanking bonus to grant each of your allies a +1 flanking bonus on their attack rolls against the threatened creature. This bonus stacks with any flanking bonuses your allies might already have.
