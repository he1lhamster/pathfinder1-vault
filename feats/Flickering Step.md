# Flickering Step (Conduit)

You can appear and disappear in the _[[spells/Blink|blink]]_ of an eye.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (planes) 9 ranks.

**Benefit:** You can use _[[spells/Dimension Door|dimension door]]_ as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). You can't teleport a distance greater than twice your base speed in this way, and you must have both line of sight and line of effect to your destination. You can use this feat's benefit once per day, plus an additional time per day for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge (planes).

**Special:** A _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_ with this feat treats Dimensional AgilityUC and any feat that lists it as a prerequisite as though they were combat feats when selecting _fighter_ bonus feats.
