# Improved Horse Whisperer

Your understanding of horses goes so deep that you can communicate with them as if you shared a language.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Horse Whisperer|Horse Whisperer]]_, Handle Animal 5 ranks, Ride 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** With a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check, you can communicate with a _[[monsters/Horse|horse]]_ as if you were using _[[spells/Speak with Animals|speak with animals]]_ for 1 round. The _horse_'s ability to communicate and take actions is still limited by its intelligence.
