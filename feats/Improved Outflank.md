# Improved Outflank (Combat, Teamwork)

You can easily find openings in your enemies' defenses.

**Prerequisites:** OutflankAPG, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** Whenever you and an ally who also has this feat are threatening the same foe, you are considered to be flanking that foe if you are adjacent to an unoccupied square from which you would be able to flank the foe with your ally.

**Normal:** You must be positioned opposite an ally to flank an opponent.
