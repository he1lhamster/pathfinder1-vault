# Stunning Irruption (Combat)

When you _[[feats/Smash|smash]]_ your way into a room, you gain more than just the element of surprise.

**Prerequisites:** Str 15, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, base attack bonus +5.

**Benefit:** Before starting combat, you can attempt to break through a door, window, or wall to enter a room. If you succeed, the violence of your arrival is so great that all characters within 20 feet of your entry point must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus) or be _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_ instead of acting in the surprise round (if there is one) plus 1 round thereafter. Characters who succeed at this save are instead _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 1d4 rounds.
