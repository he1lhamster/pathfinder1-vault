# Bulette Leap (Combat)

You can shove aside multiple opponents while leaping into the air.

**Prerequisites:** Str 15, _[[feats/Bulette Charge Style|Bulette Charge Style]]_, _[[feats/Improved Overrun|Improved Overrun]]_, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, proficiency with heavy armor.

**Benefit:** While using _Bulette Charge Style_, you gain a bonus on Acrobatics checks to _[[spells/Jump|jump]]_ equal to your Strength bonus. Additionally, when you perform an overrun combat maneuver, you can attempt to overrun multiple foes, but you take a cumulative -2 penalty on each successive overrun attempt in the same round. If an overrun attempt fails, you cannot make any further attempts until your next round.
