# Pungent Stench

Your _[[universal monster rules/Stench|stench]]_ is overwhelmingly nauseating.

**Prerequisites:** _Stench_ universal monster ability, _[[feats/Improved Stench|Improved Stench]]_, _[[feats/Great Fortitude|Great Fortitude]]_

**Benefit:** The first round a creature is affected by your _stench_, it is _[[conditions/Nauseated|nauseated]]_ in addition to being _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_. At the end of an affected creature's turn after the first round, it can make a new save against the _stench_'s DC to remove the _nauseated_ condition, but the _sickened_ condition lasts as long as normal.
