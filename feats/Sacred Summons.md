# Sacred Summons

The minions of your divine patrons stand ready to answer your call.

**Prerequisites:** Aura class feature, ability to cast _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ monster.

**Benefit:** When using _summon_ monster to _summon_ creatures whose alignment subtype or subtypes exactly match your aura, you may cast the spell as a standard action instead of with a casting time of 1 round.
