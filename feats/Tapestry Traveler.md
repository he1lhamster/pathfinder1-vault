# Tapestry Traveler

Your many visits to the Hao Jin Tapestry demiplane have made you an expert in long-distance travel.

**Prerequisites:** Character level 5th.

**Benefit:** You cast spells of the teleportation subschool as though your caster level were 2 higher, and you treat yourself as one step more familiar when teleporting to an established Pathfinder lodge with the teleport spell. If you can teleport as a supernatural ability, you treat your class level as if it were 2 higher when calculating the total distance that you can travel with this ability.
