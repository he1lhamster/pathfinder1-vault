# Heighten Spell (Metamagic)

You can cast spells as if they were a higher level.

**Benefit:** A heightened spell has a higher spell level than normal (up to a maximum of 9th level). Unlike other metamagic feats, _[[feats/Heighten Spell|Heighten Spell]]_ actually increases the effective level of the spell that it modifies. All effects dependent on spell level (such as saving throw DCs and ability to penetrate a lesser _[[spells/Globe Of Invulnerability|globe of invulnerability]]_) are calculated according to the heightened level. The heightened spell is as difficult to prepare and cast as a spell of its effective level.
