# Weapon Bearer

You attract a _[[feats/Weapon Bearer|weapon bearer]]_ to aid you in your endeavors.

**Prerequisites:** Character level 4th, proficient with all martial weapons.

**Benefit:** This feat is similar to the _[[feats/Leadership|Leadership]]_ feat, with several exceptions. You can attract only a 1st-level cohort (referred to hereafter as a _weapon bearer_) with this feat, and can't _[[npcs/Recruit|recruit]]_ followers. You determine your _Leadership_ score according to the rules presented in the _Leadership_ feat, but your _weapon bearer_ is always at least 3 levels lower than yourself. A _weapon bearer_ can take levels in only cavalierAPG, _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_, or gunslingerUC. She cannot multiclass, though she can take any archetype for which she qualifies. Once per round as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, you can retrieve an item carried by your _weapon bearer_. In addition, your _weapon bearer_ can pick up items you drop as an immediate action. In order to use either of these abilities, you and your _weapon bearer_ must be adjacent to each other and must both be able to move and communicate with each other. If a _weapon bearer_ gains enough XP to bring her to 2 levels lower than your level, she doesn't gain the new level until you gain your next level; until you advance, her XP total remains 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level. If you release your _weapon bearer_ from service or otherwise lose your _weapon bearer_, you can _recruit_ a new one. At 7th level, you can swap this feat for the _Leadership_ feat.
