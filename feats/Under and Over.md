# Under and Over (Combat)

You can slip under a foe trying to _[[universal monster rules/Grab|grab]]_ you, knocking him off balance.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Agile Maneuvers|Agile Maneuvers]]_, Small size or smaller.

**Benefit:** If an opponent larger than you attempts to grapple you and fails, you may make a _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ attack as an immediate action against that opponent with a +2 bonus. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
