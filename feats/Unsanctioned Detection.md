# Unsanctioned Detection

You can focus your ability to _[[spells/Detect Evil|detect evil]]_ for more practical or mundane purposes

**Prerequisites:** _Detect evil_ class feature.

**Benefit:** As a swift action, you can focus the _[[items/Weapon/Clarity|clarity]]_ granted by your _detect evil_ ability to heighten your awareness of other things. This gives you a +10 _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sacred|sacred]]_ bonus on Perception and Sense Motive checks for one round. This expends your use of the _detect evil_ class ability for the next 24 hours.
