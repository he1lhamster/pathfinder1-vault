# Life-Dominant Soul

You gain unusual resiliency from your mortal heritage.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Dhampir|Dhampir]]_.

**Benefit:** You are healed by channeled positive energy used to _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ living creatures and channeled negative energy used to _heal_ undead, but both only _heal_ half the normal amount. You still take damage from positive energy used to _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ undead, such as that from channeled energy and lay on hands.
