# Unstoppable Esotery (Esoteric)

When you cast a spell using esoteric materials, you reinforce your spell's magical structure, making the spell difficult to stop or remove.

**Benefit:** When you use esoteric material components as part of casting a spell, you gain a +2 bonus on concentration checks to cast that spell, and the spell is treated as though its caster level were 2 higher against attempts to dispel it. This increase is in addition to any increases due to greater component or limited magic benefits.
