# Spinning Throw (Combat)

You whirl your foe around and then let go.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Improved Bull Rush|Improved Bull Rush]]_, _[[feats/Improved Trip|Improved Trip]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Ki Throw|Ki Throw]]_.

**Benefit:** On a successful unarmed _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ combat maneuver against an opponent your size or smaller, you can spend a swift action to attempt a bull rush combat maneuver against that opponent. If your bull rush succeeds, you can move that opponent to any unoccupied square you threaten, then push that opponent the number of 5-foot increments your successful bull rush allows. The target is then knocked _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_. If the bull rush fails, you can use the _Ki Throw_ feat as normal. If you also have the _[[feats/Improved Ki Throw|Improved Ki Throw]]_ feat, a successful bull rush allows you to push the opponent into a space secondary targets occupy. You resolve this effect as if you used the _Improved Ki Throw_ feat to throw the opponent into that space.

**Special:** Per the _Ki Throw_ feat, a _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ can use ki to affect creatures larger than himself with this feat.
