# Tengu Wings

You can grow wings that allow you to fly.

**Prerequisites:** Character level 5th, _[[monsters/Tengu|tengu]]_.

**Benefit:** Once per day, you can sprout a pair of giant black crow's wings, granting you a fly speed of 30 feet (average maneuverability). This spell-like ability otherwise functions as _[[spells/Beast Shape I|beast shape I]]_ (though you do not gain any other benefits of that spell) with a caster level equal to your level.
