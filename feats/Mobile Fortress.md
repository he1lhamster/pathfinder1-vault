# Mobile Fortress (Combat)

You use your _[[items/Shield/Tower shield|tower shield]]_ to defend yourself or an ally at a moment's notice.

**Prerequisites:** Str 15, _[[feats/Mobile Bulwark Style|Mobile Bulwark Style]]_, _[[feats/Shield Focus|Shield Focus]]_, _[[feats/Tower _[[spells/Shield|Shield]]_ Proficiency|Tower _Shield_ Proficiency]]_, base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit:** While using a _tower shield_, you add half of the _shield_'s bonus to AC (including its enhancement bonus) to your touch AC and take only a -1 penalty on attack rolls because of the _shield_'s encumbrance. While using _Mobile Bulwark Style_, whenever you would use a _tower shield_ to gain total cover, you also grant any adjacent ally total cover against attacks passing through the selected edge of your space.
