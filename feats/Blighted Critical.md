# Blighted Critical (Critical)

With a critical hit from a spell or spell-like ability, you give the target a minor spellblight.

**Prerequisites:** Caster level 5th.

**Benefit:** Whenever you confirm a critical hit with a touch spell, ranged touch spell, or spell-like ability against an opponent, the victim gains a random minor spellblight (see page 95).

**Special:** You can apply the effects of only one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess _[[feats/Critical Mastery|Critical Mastery]]_.
