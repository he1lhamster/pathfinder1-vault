# Scarlet Rose Devotion

Through the bond of sisterhood, you can inspire your allies to overcome terrible threats.

**Prerequisites:** BodyguardAPG, _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_, Perform (oratory) 3 ranks, any good alignment.

**Benefit:** Whenever an ally within 30 feet attempts a saving throw, you can attempt a DC 10 Perform (oratory) check as an immediate action. If you are successful, the ally gains a +2 morale bonus on her saving throw. This ability has no effect if your ally cannot hear you speak or understand your words.
