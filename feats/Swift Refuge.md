# Swift Refuge (Combat)

You quickly turn, forcing devastating blows to be blunted by the thickest part of your armor.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, Dex 13, _[[feats/Swift Iron Style|Swift Iron Style]]_, proficiency with _[[classes/Medium|medium]]_ armor.

**Benefit:** Once per day when using _Swift Iron Style_, when you're hit by a weapon, unarmed attack, or natural weapon, you can treat all dice other than the weapon's base damage dice (including extra dice from sneak attack, critical hit, magic special weapon abilities, and _[[feats/Vital Strike|Vital Strike]]_) as having rolled 1s. You can use this ability a second time per day when your base attack bonus reaches +8, and a third time at +16.
