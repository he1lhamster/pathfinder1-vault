# Burn It Down! (Combat, Teamwork)

_[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Burning|Burning]]_ torches and the discordant symphony of riotous _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Singing|singing]]_ ignite the fervor within you.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +1, _[[monsters/Goblin|goblin]]_.

**Benefit:** Whenever you make an attack with a _[[items/Mundane/Torch|torch]]_, a _[[items/Mundane/Flask|flask]]_ of _[[items/Mundane/Lamp|lamp]]_ oil fitted with a fuse, _[[items/Mundane/Alchemist's fire|alchemist's fire]]_, or a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Flaming|flaming]]_ weapon, you gain a morale bonus on your damage roll equal to the number of _goblin_ allies within 30 feet who also have this feat (maximum +4). This bonus damage is fire damage.
