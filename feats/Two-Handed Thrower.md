# Two-Handed Thrower (Combat)

You hurl weapons with both hands and with great force, sometimes using a whirling technique to send your weapon flying through the air at tremendous speeds.

**Prerequisites:** Str 15.

**Benefit:** Whenever you use two hands to throw a onehanded or two-handed weapon, you gain a bonus on damage rolls equal to 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus. Using two hands to throw any weapon requires only a standard action for you. If you also have the _[[feats/Quick Draw|Quick Draw]]_ feat, you can throw two-handed weapons at your full normal rate of attacks.

**Normal:** You add your Strength bonus on thrown weapon damage, regardless of available hands. _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Throwing|Throwing]]_ a twohanded weapon is a full-round action.
