# Greater Reposition (Combat)

When you reposition foes, they are left vulnerable to the attacks of your allies.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Improved Reposition|Improved Reposition]]_, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to reposition a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by _Improved Reposition_. Whenever you reposition a foe, his movement provokes attacks of opportunity from all of your allies (but not you).

**Normal:** Creatures moved by reposition do not provoke attacks of opportunity.
