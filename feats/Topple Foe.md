# Topple Foe (Combat, Teamwork)

You and your allies can work together to _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ larger foes.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Improved Trip|Improved Trip]]_.

**Benefit:** If you attempt to _trip_ a foe that is larger than you, you gain a +1 bonus on your CMB check to _trip_ the foe as long as an ally with _[[feats/Topple Foe|Topple Foe]]_ is flanking the foe with you. If multiple allies with _Topple Foe_ are flanking the foe with you, you gain an additional +2 bonus on your CMD check for each additional ally that's flanking the target. The bonuses granted by this feat stack with those granted by _Improved Trip_ and _[[feats/Greater Trip|Greater Trip]]_. Each time you attempt to _trip_ the same foe in consecutive rounds, the bonus granted to your _trip_ attempt increases by +1 per ally, to a maximum bonus of +4 per flanking ally on the 4th round of consecutive _trip_ attempts.
