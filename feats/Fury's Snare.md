# Fury's Snare (Combat)

You _[[spells/Entangle|entangle]]_ your foe in your weapon.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Fury's Fall|Fury's Fall]]_, _[[feats/Improved Trip|Improved Trip]]_.

**Benefit:** If you successfully use a _[[items/Weapon/Whip|whip]]_ to _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ a foe, you can choose to drop your _whip_. Your tripped target gains the _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_ condition. The target can break free of the _whip_ by making a DC 10 Strength check or a DC 15 Escape Artist check (add the enhancement bonus of the _whip_ to these DCs), or by using a full-round action to disentangle himself. Escaping the _whip_ by making a Strength check means the _whip_ gains the _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ condition. If the _whip_ has a magical quality such as _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Flaming|flaming]]_, apply this quality's damage to the target every round on your turn.
