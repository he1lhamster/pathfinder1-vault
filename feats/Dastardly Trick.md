# Dastardly Trick (Combat, Panache)

Your confident attacks leave your foes wavering and unable to regain their composure.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13; Amateur SwashbucklerACG or panacheACG class feature; _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_; Improved Dirty TrickAPG.

**Benefit:** When you attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver check and _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ 1 point of panache, if the maneuver is successful, your opponent must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier) to remove its dirty trick condition.
