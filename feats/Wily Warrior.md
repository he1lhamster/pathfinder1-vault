# Wily Warrior (Story)

Those who observe your imposing demeanor assume muscle is your sole advantage, but you prove them wrong every time.

**Prerequisites:** Bluff 1 rank, Sense Motive 1 rank, base attack bonus +1, or you must have the Military Strategist background (page 5).

**Benefit:** Once per day, you can use your ranks in Sense Motive in place of your total Will saving throw modifier when attempting a Will save. You must decide to use this ability prior to attempting the saving throw.

**Goal:** Thwart an appropriate number of challenging foes after getting a negative hunch about them when they attempted to deceive you or after ambushing them.

**Completion Benefit:** The DC of Bluff and Intimidate checks attempted against you increase by 5.
