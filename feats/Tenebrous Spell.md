# Tenebrous Spell (Metamagic)

You _[[spells/Blend|blend]]_ _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|shadow]]_ into your spells, increasing their efficacy at the price of susceptibility to light.

**Benefit:** When you cast a _[[feats/Tenebrous Spell|tenebrous spell]]_ in _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_ or dim light, the spell's effective caster level and any associated save DCs are increased by 1. Any attempts at _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Dispelling|dispelling]]_ a _tenebrous spell_ in _darkness_ or dim light take a -2 penalty on the dispel check. Casting a _tenebrous spell_ in bright light is difficult, and requires a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the _tenebrous spell_'s effective spell level). Attempts to dispel a _tenebrous spell_ in bright light gain a +4 bonus on the dispel check. You cannot use this feat on spells with the light descriptor. A _tenebrous spell_ uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level, except in the case of spells with the _darkness_ or _shadow_ descriptor or of the illusion (_shadow_) subschool; this feat does not change the effective level of those spells (but still counts as using a metamagic feat for all other purposes).
