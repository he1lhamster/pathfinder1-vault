# Greater Overrun (Combat)

Enemies must dive to avoid your dangerous move.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Overrun|Improved Overrun]]_, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, base attack bonus +6, Str 13.

**Benefit:** You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to overrun a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by _Improved Overrun_. Whenever you overrun opponents, they provoke attacks of opportunity if they are knocked _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ by your overrun.

**Normal:** Creatures knocked _prone_ by your overrun do not provoke an attack of opportunity.
