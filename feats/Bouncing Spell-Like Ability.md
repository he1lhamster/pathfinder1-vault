# Bouncing Spell-Like Ability (Monster)

You can retarget one of your _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ when it fails to affect its original target.

**Prerequisites:** Spell-like ability at caster level 4th or higher.

**Benefit:** Choose one of your _spell-like abilities_, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a _[[feats/Bouncing Spell-Like Ability|bouncing spell-like ability]]_ three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). Whenever you use a _bouncing spell-like ability_ against a single target and the ability has no effect on it (whether due to _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ or a successful saving throw), as a swift action, you can redirect the spell-like ability to target another eligible creature within range. The redirected spell-like ability behaves as if its new target were the original target for the spell-like ability. _Spell-like abilities_ that affect a target in any way (including a lesser effect from a successful saving throw) can't be redirected in this manner. You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 1. For a summary, see Table 3-1.

**Special:** This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.
