# Shield Gauntlet Style (Combat, Style)

You use your _[[items/Weapon/Gauntlet|gauntlet]]_ to _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ you from _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_gauntlet_ or _[[items/Weapon/Spiked gauntlet|spiked gauntlet]]_), proficiency with bucklers and light shields.

**Benefit:** When using this style, if you begin your turn wearing a _gauntlet_ or _spiked gauntlet_ on your off hand, and you are not using that hand to hold or make attacks with any other weapons or _shield_, you gain a +1 _shield_ bonus to AC. You lose this _shield_ bonus whenever you attack with your _gauntlet_ or hold a weapon or _shield_ in that hand. While receiving this _shield_ bonus to AC, your _gauntlet_ or _spiked gauntlet_ is treated as a _[[items/Armor/Buckler|buckler]]_ for the purpose of using other feats and abilities (though you are also considered to have a free hand). This feat acts as the _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_ feat for the purpose of satisfying the prerequisites of the _[[feats/Deflect Arrows|Deflect Arrows]]_ and _[[feats/Snatch Arrows|Snatch Arrows]]_ feats.
