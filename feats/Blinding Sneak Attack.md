# Blinding Sneak Attack (Combat)

When you strike from the cover of _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_, you inject foes with a fraction of your foul magic.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +5, _darkness_ spell-like ability, sneak attack class feature, _[[monsters/Tiefling|tiefling]]_.

**Benefit:** When you successfully deal sneak attack damage to a foe while you are within an area of magical _darkness_, you temporarily blind your opponent for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + the amount of sneak attack damage dealt) negates this effect.
