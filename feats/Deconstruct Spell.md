# Deconstruct Spell

You deconstruct a spell into its constituent glyphs, storing them to replenish your crystalline dust.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Counterspell|Improved Counterspell]]_ or ability to cast _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ or greater _dispel magic_, _[[monsters/Aphorite|aphorite]]_, crystalline dust racial trait.

**Benefit:** Once per day when you successfully counterspell or dispel a spell, you can instead deconstruct the spell to regain a number of rounds of your crystalline dust racial trait equal to half the level of the spell. You can't use this feat to gain more than your maximum number of rounds of your crystalline dust racial trait.
