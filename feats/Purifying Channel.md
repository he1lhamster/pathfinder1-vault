# Purifying Channel

Your healing energy also damages your enemies.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 15, _[[feats/Selective Channeling|Selective Channeling]]_, channel energy class feature.

**Benefit:** When you channel positive energy to _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_, one creature that you exclude from your _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Channeling|channeling]]_ takes an amount of fire damage equal to the die result you roll for healing, and is _[[conditions/Dazzled|dazzled]]_ for 1 round by the light of these flames. A successful saving throw against your channel energy halves the fire damage and negates the _dazzled_ effect.
