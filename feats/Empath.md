# Empath

You have learned how to psychically sense an individual's mood or altered mental state.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Psychic Sensitivity|Psychic Sensitivity]]_ or ability to cast _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ spells, Perception 1 rank or Sense Motive 1 rank.

**Benefit:** You can use either Perception or Sense Motive when reading an _[[universal monster rules/Emotion Aura|emotion aura]]_ with the read aura occult skill unlock. Reading a creature's _emotion aura_ takes you only a full-round action instead of 10 minutes, and if you succeed at your check, you also determine whether that creature is currently affected by a _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ or mind-affecting effect and the relative strength of that effect (minor, moderate, strong, as defined in _[[spells/Detect Magic|detect magic]]_). You don't learn the source of the effect or the actual effect. You can also use the read aura occult skill unlock to read emotion auras more than once per day by opening your innate mental defenses. For 1 minute after you use this feat, you take a -4 penalty on saving throws against _fear_ and mind-affecting effects (regardless of whether you succeeded at the check). During this time, you're also unable to attempt to read emotion auras. Using this feat doesn't use up your one daily use of the read aura unlock, which you can still use either to read another type of aura or to read an _emotion aura_ without taking the penalty associated with this feat.
