# Ambush Sense (Combat)

You live in dangerous times, and are alert for betrayal or unexpected attack.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, trap sense class feature.

**Benefit:** You gain a bonus on Perception checks made to determine awareness for the surprise round of combat, and a _[[feats/Dodge|dodge]]_ bonus to AC in any surprise round in which you get to act. These bonuses are equal to the bonus you gain from trap sense.
