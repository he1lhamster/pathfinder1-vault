# Ancestral Weapon Mastery (Combat)

You have mastered ancient techniques that increase the effectiveness of your race's ancestral weapons.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +1, weapon familiarity racial trait.

**Benefit:** You're proficient with all of your race's racial weapons (the weapons mentioned in your race's weapon familiarity racial trait). If you're already proficient with any of those weapons, you instead gain _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ for one of those weapons as a bonus feat. Furthermore, if you gain _Weapon Focus_ as a bonus feat with one of your racial weapons as a result of this feat, you can change which racial weapon your bonus _Weapon Focus_ feat applies to by engaging in 10 minutes of practice with the new weapon. The benefits of this bonus _Weapon Focus_ feat last until you choose to practice and apply it to a different racial weapon.
