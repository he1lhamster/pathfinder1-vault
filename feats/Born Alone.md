# Born Alone

You are so tough and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_ that you killed and ate the rest of your litter while still in the womb.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Orc|Orc]]_.

**Benefit:** Whenever you kill or _[[spells/Knock|knock]]_ _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_ an opponent with a melee attack, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution bonus (minimum 1) until your next turn. These temporary hit points do not stack. You do not gain this bonus if the opponent is _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ or has less than half your Hit Dice.
