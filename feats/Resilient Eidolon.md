# Resilient Eidolon

Your link with your eidolon is strong enough that it can remain with you for a short time after you fall _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_ or are killed.

**Prerequisites:** Eidolon class feature.

**Benefit:** If you are knocked _unconscious_, fall asleep, or are killed, your eidolon remains for a number of rounds equal to your _[[classes/Summoner|summoner]]_ level before it is banished. If you are brought back to consciousness before this duration expires, your eidolon is not banished. If the duration expires before you are brought back to consciousness, your eidolon is banished normally.

**Normal:** An eidolon is immediately banished when its _summoner_ is _unconscious_, asleep, or killed.
