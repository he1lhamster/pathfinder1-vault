# Esoteric Divination (Esoteric)

_[[spells/Scrying|Scrying]]_ and other difficult divinations become more likely to get to the truth when you use verdant salts.

**Benefit:** When you cast a _[[spells/Divination|divination]]_ spell using verdant salts as an esoteric material component, you're more likely to get good information. You gain one of the following benefits, as appropriate to the spell: you increase the likelihood of a percentage-based _divination_ to work correctly by 5% (giving a -5 penalty on the d% roll for _[[spells/Contact Other Plane|contact other plane]]_, for example), you gain a +2 competence bonus on Perception checks while perceiving through a _divination_ (_scrying_) spell such as _scrying_, or you can ask one additional question (with _contact other plane_ or _[[spells/Speak with Dead|speak with dead]]_). When you gain verdant salts' greater component effect with a _divination_ spell, increase the DC by an additional 1.
