# Inerrant Justice (Story)

You will punish the guilty without letting any innocents be harmed as a result.

**Prerequisites:** Must have witnessed or suffered a grave injustice that went unpunished, or have the An Eye for an EyeUCA or the RaidersUCA background. If the offender is not a challenging foe, it either advances to become one or allies with one or more creatures who are.

**Benefit:** Once per day, you can choose to take the maximum possible weapon damage die roll rather than rolling when you hit a foe that is unaware of you or considers you an ally. Bonus dice, including from sneak attack, surprise attack, and _[[feats/Vital Strike|Vital Strike]]_, are rolled normally.

**Goal:** Decisively defeat or slay the offender without killing any innocents in the process. You can complete the goal after killing innocents if you receive an _[[spells/Atonement|atonement]]_ spell.

**Completion Benefit:** You can use this feat's benefit once per combat.
