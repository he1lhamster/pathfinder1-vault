# Whispered Knowledge

You possess secret knowledge that enhances and helps perfect your undead form.

**Prerequisites:** Corporeal undead, Whispering Way 15 TPA.

**Benefit:** Choose one of the following secrets: 
Secret of Blood: After successfully dealing damage to a living creature with a melee attack, you can consume that creature's blood from your weapon as a swift action, gaining 1d8 temporary hit points, a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength, and a +1 bonus to your caster level. This lasts 10 minutes per Hit Die of your target, and otherwise acts as a _[[spells/Death Knell|death knell]]_ spell. 
Secret of Bone: Your bones harden and calcify. You gain DR 5/bludgeoning. 
Secret of Brains: As secret of blood, but you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your Intelligence instead of Strength. This ability has no effect on mindless targets. 
Secret of the Grave: You can designate an _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Unholy|unholy]]_ container for your remains, such as a coffin, _[[items/Wondrous Item/Canopic Jar|canopic jar]]_, or burial urn. When in this container and not taking any actions, you gain _[[universal monster rules/Fast Healing|fast healing]]_ 5.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, you learn a new secret.
