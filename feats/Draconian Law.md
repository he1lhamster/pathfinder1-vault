**Prerequisites:** Lawful alignment, _[[monsters/Wyvaran|wyvaran]]_.

**Benefit:** When fighting an enemy you've witnessed _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Breaking|breaking]]_ the law, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on your first attack roll and on all damage rolls against that target until it has been tried for its crime.
