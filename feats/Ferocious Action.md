# Ferocious Action

You _[[universal monster rules/Ferocity|ferocity]]_ is quick but shorter lived.

**Prerequisites:** _Ferocity_ racial trait, _[[monsters/Orc|orc]]_.

**Benefit:** When you fall to 0 hit points or fewer, you lose 2 hit points each round, but you are not _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_. If you are in a _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ (such as that caused by the _[[classes/Barbarian|barbarian]]_ _rage_ class feature), you instead only lose 1 hit point per round.
