# Improved Critical (Combat)

Attacks made with your chosen weapon are quite _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Proficient with weapon, base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit:** When using the weapon you selected, your threat range is doubled.

**Special:** You can gain _[[feats/Improved Critical|Improved Critical]]_ multiple times. The effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of weapon. This effect doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon.
