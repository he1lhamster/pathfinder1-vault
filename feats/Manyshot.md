# Manyshot (Combat)

You can fire multiple arrows at a single target.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 17, _[[feats/Point-Blank Shot|Point-Blank Shot]]_, _[[feats/Rapid Shot|Rapid Shot]]_, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** When making a full-attack action with a bow, your first attack fires two arrows. If the attack hits, both arrows hit. Apply precision-based damage (such as sneak attack) and critical hit damage only once for this attack. Damage bonuses from using a composite bow with a high Strength bonus apply to each arrow, as do other damage bonuses, such as a _[[classes/Ranger|ranger]]_'s favored enemy bonus. _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|Damage reduction]]_ and resistances apply separately to each arrow.
