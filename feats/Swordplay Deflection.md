# Swordplay Deflection (Combat)

You can deflect incoming attacks.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Improved Feint|Improved Feint]]_, _[[feats/Swordplay Style|Swordplay Style]]_, _[[feats/Swordplay Upset|Swordplay Upset]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ with the chosen weapon, base attack bonus +7.

**Benefit:** While using _Swordplay Style_, when you make one or more melee attacks, you can forgo a single melee attack to prepare an action to disrupt an opponent's attack. This functions as a _[[classes/Swashbuckler|swashbuckler]]_'s opportune parry and riposteACG deed, except that if your result is greater than your opponent's, you gain a +4 _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ bonus to your Armor Class against attacks made by your opponent until the start of your next turn instead of preventing the hit, and you cannot attempt to riposte. If you have the opportune parry and riposte deed, you gain this Armor Class bonus anytime you successfully parry an opponent's attack.
