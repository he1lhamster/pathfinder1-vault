# Inspired Sneak Attack (Combat)

Your brilliant insight makes you more dangerous in combat.

**Prerequisites:** Inspiration pool; sneak attack or studied strike class feature.

**Benefit:** When dealing sneak attack or studied strike damage, you can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ a use of inspiration from your pool to reroll all of your sneak attack dice that resulted in 1s. If you have the powerful sneakAPG _[[classes/Rogue|rogue]]_ talent, rather than treat all 1s on your sneak attack damage dice as 2s, you can reroll all your sneak attack dice that resulted in 1s. If you have the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ sneakAPG advanced _rogue_ talent, rather than treat all 1s and 2s on your sneak attack damage dice as 3s, you can reroll all your sneak attack damage dice that resulted in 1s or 2s. In either case, you must take the result of the rerolls, even if it's worse than the original result.
