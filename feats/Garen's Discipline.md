# Garen's Discipline (Combat)

You've learned to defend yourself against spell and storm with dazzling flourishes of your weapon.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Alertness|Alertness]]_, _[[feats/Exotic Weapon Proficiency|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]]_ (_[[items/Weapon/Aldori _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Dueling|dueling]]_ sword|Aldori _dueling_ sword]]_), _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_Aldori _dueling_ sword_), base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit:** Whenever you use _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, fight defensively, or take the total defense action, choose a type of saving throw. (You can choose a different type each time you take such an action.) Once per round before attempting a saving throw using the selected save, you gain a +2 bonus on that save. If you have a base attack bonus of +11 or higher, this bonus increases to +3. If you have a base attack bonus of +16 or higher, the bonus instead increases to +4.
