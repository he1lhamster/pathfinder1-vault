# Multiweapon Defense

You _[[spells/Sacrifice|sacrifice]]_ attacks to parry blows.

**Prerequisites:** Three or more arms, Dex 21

**Benefit:** When you make a full-attack action, you may choose not to take an attack with a number of your wielded weapons other than your primary weapon. For each attack you forgo, you gain a +1 _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ bonus to your AC for that round. This bonus stacks with itself to a maximum bonus of +5, but not with _shield_ bonuses to AC from other sources.
