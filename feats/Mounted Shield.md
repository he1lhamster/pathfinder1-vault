# Mounted Shield (Combat)

Your defensive tactics defend both you and your _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Mounted Combat|Mounted Combat]]_, _[[feats/Shield Focus|Shield Focus]]_.

**Benefit:** You may add your base _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ bonus (including the bonus from _Shield Focus_ but not including enhancement bonuses) to your _mount_'s AC. In addition, you may add this bonus when making a Ride check to negate a hit against your _mount_ using the _Mounted Combat_ feat.
