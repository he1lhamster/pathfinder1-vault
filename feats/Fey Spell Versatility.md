**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, Spellcraft 1 rank, ability to cast _[[classes/Ranger|ranger]]_ spells.

**Benefit:** Choose a 1st-level spell, a 2nd-level spell, a 3rd-level spell, and a 4th-level spell from the _[[classes/Bard|bard]]_, sorcerer/wizard, or _[[classes/Witch|witch]]_ spell list that is either from the enchantment or illusion school or a spell with the curseUM descriptor. Add those spells to your _ranger_ spell list. Once chosen, these spells cannot be changed.
