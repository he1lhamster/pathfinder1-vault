# Telepathic Distraction

Your mastery of mental communication lets you assault and weaken the minds of your opponents.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 15, _[[monsters/Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]]_.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can focus your _[[universal monster rules/Telepathy|telepathy]]_ on one creature within range to weaken its _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ to mental attacks. The target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and take a -2 penalty against mind-affecting effects; the penalty lasts for 1d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your Hit Dice.
