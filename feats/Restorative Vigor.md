# Restorative Vigor (Combat)

You can recover from additional kinds of damage using your _[[spells/Vigor|vigor]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Con 15, _[[feats/Combat Vigor|Combat Vigor]]_*, character level 8th.

**Benefit:** Your _vigor_ pool gains 1 _vigor_ point. Whenever you spend _vigor_ points, you can recover from 1d3 points of ability score damage from one physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution) instead of regaining 1d6 hit points. You can choose separately for each _vigor_ point spent. For example, if you spend 2 _vigor_ points, you could regain 2d6 hit points; recover 2d3 points of ability damage from up to two physical ability scores total; or regain 1d6 hit points and recover from 1d3 points of ability damage from one physical ability score.
