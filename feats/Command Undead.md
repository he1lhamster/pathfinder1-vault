# Command Undead

Using foul powers of necromancy, you can _[[spells/Command Undead|command undead]]_ creatures, making them into your servants.

**Prerequisites:** Channel negative energy class feature.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can use one of your uses of channel negative energy to enslave undead within 30 feet. Undead receive a Will save to negate the effect. The DC for this Will save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ level + your Charisma modifier. Undead that fail their saves fall under your control, obeying your commands to the best of their ability, as if under the effects of _[[spells/Control Undead|control undead]]_. Intelligent undead receive a new saving throw each day to resist your command. You can control any number of undead, so long as their total Hit Dice do not exceed your _cleric_ level. If you use channel energy in this way, it has no other effect (it does not _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ or _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ nearby creatures). If an undead creature is under the control of another creature, you must make an opposed Charisma check whenever your orders conflict.
