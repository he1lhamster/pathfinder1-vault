# Kirin Strike (Combat)

You have read the texts of the perfect way, and know how _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ to your enemies' weak spot.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Kirin Style|Kirin Style]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, Knowledge (arcana) 9 ranks, Knowledge (dungeoneering, local, nature, planes, or religion) 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 insight bonus on Knowledge checks made to _identify_ creatures, including the one _Kirin Style_ allows. While using _Kirin Style_ against a creature you have identified using that feat, as a swift action after you have hit a creature with a melee or ranged attack, you can add twice your Intelligence modifier in damage (minimum 2).
