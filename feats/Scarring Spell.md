# Scarring Spell (Metamagic)

Your emotion-affecting magic causes _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ trauma in your opponents.

**Benefit:** When a creature fails a saving throw against a _[[feats/Scarring Spell|scarring spell]]_, for the next 24 hours that creature takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against emotion and _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effects you create, and a -1 penalty on saving throws against other emotion and _fear_ effects. Penalties from multiple scarring spells don't stack. This metamagic feat can be applied only to spells with the emotion or _fear_ descriptor. A _scarring spell_ uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.
