# Lingering Performance

The effects of your bardic performance carry on, even after you have stopped performing.

**Prerequisites:** Bardic performance class feature.

**Benefit:** The bonuses and penalties from your bardic performance continue for 2 rounds after you cease performing. Any other requirement, such as range or specific conditions, must still be met for the effect to continue. If you begin a new bardic performance during this time, the effects of the previous performance immediately cease.
