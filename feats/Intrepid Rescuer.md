# Intrepid Rescuer (Combat)

You instinctively react to interfere with foes that attack your allies or innocents.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_, worshiper of Kurgess.

**Benefit:** Whenever an opponent you threaten makes an attack against a _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_, _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_, or _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_ ally or any attack against a noncombatant, that opponent provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If your attack of opportunity hits your foe, she takes a -4 penalty on the attack roll that provoked this attack of opportunity.
