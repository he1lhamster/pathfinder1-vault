# Tail Weapon (Combat)

You have strengthened your tail enough that you can use it to make slap attacks and augment your balance.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +1, _[[monsters/Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]]_.

**Benefit:** You can make a tail slap attack with your tail. This is a secondary natural attack that deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage. You also gain a +2 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks to balance and to your CMD against maneuvers that attempt to move you from your square.
