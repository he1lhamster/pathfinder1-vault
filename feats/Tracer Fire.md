# Tracer Fire (Combat)

You highlight the path of your projectile with light, allowing your allies to better spot the target.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Point-Blank Shot|Point-Blank Shot]]_, _[[feats/Precise Shot|Precise Shot]]_.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can make a single ranged attack at your highest base attack bonus with an illuminated _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Throwing|throwing]]_ weapon or piece of ammunition, such as a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Flaming|flaming]]_ shuriken or an arrow imbued with a magical light effect. If the attack hits its target, attacks against the same target gain a +2 circumstance bonus for 1 round, so long as those attacks originate in dim light or darker areas. The target counts as being in bright light until the projectile is removed or extinguished. Removing the projectile is a move action that provokes an attack of opportunity.
