# Skaveling Companion

You are bonded with a terrifying undead _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_ created through foul daemonic rites.

**Prerequisites:** 7th level in a class that grants an animal companion or _mount_, _[[monsters/Urdefhan|urdefhan]]_.

**Benefit:** In place of the animal companion or _mount_ granted by your class feature, you are bonded with a skaveling (Bestiary 2 42). Though less intelligent than others of its kind and lacking the ability to paralyze and infect victims with its bite, the beast serves you unerringly.
