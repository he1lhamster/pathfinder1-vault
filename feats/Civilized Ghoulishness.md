# Civilized Ghoulishness

Although undead, you can easily pass as living.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Ghoul|Ghoul]]_, Charisma 18.

**Benefit:** Your appearance is such that, while paleskinned and gaunt, you can pass as a living humanoid of your choice. You gain a +10 racial bonus on Disguise checks made to appear human, and your _[[universal monster rules/Channel Resistance|channel resistance]]_ increases by +2. Ghasts with this feat can activate or suppress their _[[universal monster rules/Stench|stench]]_ ability as a free action.
