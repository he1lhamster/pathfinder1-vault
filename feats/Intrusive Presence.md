# Intrusive Presence

You can rif le through the thoughts and memories of your host.

**Prerequisites:** Int or Cha 21, _[[spells/Hidden Presence|Hidden Presence]]_, _[[feats/Manipulative Presence|Manipulative Presence]]_, ability to cast _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_ or greater _possession_.

**Benefit:** You can use _[[spells/Detect Thoughts|detect thoughts]]_ at will as a spell-like ability against a host creature you possess. The host receives no saving throw, and the effect functions as if you had concentrated for 3 rounds. You can also use _[[spells/Seek Thoughts|seek thoughts]]_ on your host as a spell-like ability once during the _possession_. The host can attempt a Will save with a DC equal to the DC of the original _possession_ effect. If the host succeeds, the effect fails and the host become aware of the _possession_ if it wasn't already.
