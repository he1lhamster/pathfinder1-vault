# Heroic Leader (Combat)

Whether part of a partnership or an army, you stand head and shoulders above your companions.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13; any combat feat; ability to gain an animal companion, cohort, eidolon, familiar, or _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_.

**Benefit:** Your animal companion, cohort, eidolon, familiar, or _mount_ doesn't count as threatening your opponent for the purposes of feats that require you to be the only character threatening a target. Allies with Hit Dice equal to or less than 1/2 your own Hit Dice don't count as threatening opponents for the purposes of such feats.
