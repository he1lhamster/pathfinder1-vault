# Bolster Undead

You can fortify undead against positive energy.

**Prerequisites:** Channel energy 6d6, worshiper of Urgathoa.

**Benefit:** Whenever you channel negative energy to _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ undead creatures, you grant all undead you _heal_ +1 _[[universal monster rules/Channel Resistance|channel resistance]]_ (or a +1 bonus to their existing _channel resistance_) for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round).
