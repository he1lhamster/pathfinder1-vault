# Fascination Jinx

If you jinx an already _[[conditions/Fascinated|fascinated]]_ creature, it doesn't fully recover until the jinx ends.

**Prerequisites:** Bardic performance class feature, Halfling Jinx trait.

**Benefit:** If you jinx a creature under the effect of a _[[classes/Bard|bard]]_'s fascinate ability, it also takes a -10 penalty on initiative checks while affected by the jinx. A creature under the effect of your fascinate ability has a -2 penalty on its save against your jinx.
