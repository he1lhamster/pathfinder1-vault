# Spider Summoner

You gain the ability to _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ powerful spiders.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to cast _summon_ monster or _summon_ nature's ally spells, _[[monsters/Drow|drow]]_.

**Benefit:** When casting either a _summon_ monster spell or a _summon_ nature's ally spell, your options increase. Depending on the level of the spell, you can _summon_ the spiders listed below. 
_Summon_ Monster: 1st level-giant crab spider* (Bestiary 3 254); 4th level-giant black widow* (Bestiary 2 256); 5th level-ogre spider* (Bestiary 3 256); 7th level-giant tarantula* (Bestiary 2 256) 
_Summon_ Nature's Ally: 1st level-giant crab spider (Bestiary 3 254); 4th level-giant black widow (Bestiary 2 256); 5th level-ogre spider (Bestiary 3 256); 7th level- giant tarantula (Bestiary 2 256) Creatures marked with an asterisk (*) are summoned with the celestial template if you are good, and the fiendish template if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Furthermore, when you _summon_ spiders using _summon_ monster or _summon_ nature's ally, the DC of the summoned monster's poison and web effects increases by 2.
