# Create Reliquary Arms and Shields

Your magical creations are infused with _[[spells/Divine Power|divine power]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Craft Magic Arms and Armor|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]]_, ability to cast _[[spells/Consecrate|consecrate]]_ or _[[spells/Desecrate|desecrate]]_.

**Benefit:** When you craft a _[[spells/Magic Weapon|magic weapon]]_, magic armor, or magic _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_, you may add one casting of _consecrate_ or _desecrate_ as part of the item crafting process. This increases the item's Price by 250 gp. The item becomes a reliquary and can be used as a holy (or _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Unholy|unholy]]_) symbol divine focus of your deity. If you cast _consecrate_ or _desecrate_, your reliquary counts as a permanent fixture for that spell while it remains in the spell's area.
