# Mountain-Splitting Strike (Combat)

You have learned techniques to focus the force of an unarmed strike into the most vulnerable parts of a large opponent's anatomy.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 13, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_.

**Benefit:** When you make a charge attack against an opponent at least one size category larger than you, your unarmed attacks deal damage as though you were one size category larger. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus to the DC of any _[[feats/Stunning Fist|Stunning Fist]]_ effect you deliver with this charge attack.
