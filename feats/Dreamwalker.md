# Dreamwalker

Your dreams are as vivid as your waking hours, and you can slip into a dreamlike state with no effort.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 17, Lucid DreamerOA, _[[feats/Practiced Dreamer|Practiced Dreamer]]_*, Knowledge (planes) 10 ranks.

**Benefit:** Your experience in the Dimension of Dreams allows you to enter the demiplane with ease. You no longer have to attempt a Charisma check when entering the Dimension of Dreams to determine whether or not you are at a disadvantage, instead automatically arriving unhindered.
