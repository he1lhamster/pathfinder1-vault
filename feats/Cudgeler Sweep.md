# Cudgeler Sweep (Combat, Style)

Your powerful blows can _[[spells/Knock|knock]]_ down your opponents.

**Prerequisites:** BludgeonerUC, _[[feats/Cudgeler Style|Cudgeler Style]]_, base attack bonus +5 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 5th.

**Benefit:** When you hit with a charge attack using the _Cudgeler Style_ feat, you can immediately attempt a single _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ combat maneuver check against the target with a +2 competence bonus as a free action. This provokes an attack of opportunity as normal for a _trip_ combat maneuver.
