# Perfect Style (Combat, Style)

You have trained at one of the Houses of Perfection.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 13; base attack bonus +5 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 5th.

**Benefit:** When you take this feat, choose one of the Houses of Perfection; once this decision has been made, it cannot be changed. While using this style, you gain a type of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Energy Resistance|energy resistance]]_ based on the House of Perfection you have chosen. Students of the Monastery of Untwisting Iron gain acid _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ 5. Students of the Monastery of Unblinking Flame gain fire _resistance_ 5. Students of the Monastery of Unfolding Wind gain electricity _resistance_ 5. If you have _energy resistance_ from a racial trait or class feature, the _energy resistance_ gained from this style stacks. Additionally, you gain a ki pool that you can use to activate abilities of your chosen House of Perfection style. Your pool contains 2 ki points, and this increases by 1 point at 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter. If you have a ki pool from another source, you do not gain additional ki points from this feat.

**Special:** You can select _[[feats/Perfect Style|Perfect Style]]_ multiple times. Each time you do so, you must select a different House of Perfection to belong to.
