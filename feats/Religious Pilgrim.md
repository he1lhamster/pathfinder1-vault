# Religious Pilgrim

You are a _[[feats/Religious Pilgrim|religious pilgrim]]_ who often journeys great distances to holy sites of your faith. You take solace in fulfilling your religious purpose and vows, and those you meet respect your dedication and faithfulness.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (geography) 2 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 4 ranks.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus to Will saves, Diplomacy checks, and Survival checks. If you are good, this is a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sacred|sacred]]_ bonus; if you are evil, it's profane. Neutral characters must choose when taking this feat whether the bonus is _sacred_ or profane (if you channel positive or negative energy you must choose the same type as your _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Channeling|channeling]]_ type). These bonuses increase to +2 if you are on ground that is consecrated to your faith (under the effects of _[[spells/Consecrate|consecrate]]_, _[[spells/Desecrate|desecrate]]_, _[[spells/Hallow|hallow]]_, or _[[spells/Unhallow|unhallow]]_ cast by someone of your religion). You may purchase non-magical religious items (including _[[items/Mundane/Holy water|holy water]]_) at a 20% discount.
