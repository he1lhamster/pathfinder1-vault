# Esoteric Linguistics

You can decipher even the most exotic of writings, including those that contain magic.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Skill Focus|Skill Focus]]_ (Linguistics).

**Benefit:** You can attempt a Linguistics check in place of a Use Magic Device check to activate a scroll, or in place of a Spellcraft check to _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ a scroll. You must still have (or emulate) the ability score required to cast a spell of the desired level, and you cannot use Linguistics on the check to emulate the required ability score.
