# Masked By Fear

You embody all that you _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ while wearing your _[[items/Mundane/Mask|mask]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Nameless One|Nameless One]]_; base Will save bonus +6 or bravery class feature.

**Benefit:** By donning a _mask_ etched with your greatest terrors, you are able to eschew _fear_ completely. While benefiting from the _Nameless One_ feat, when you suffer the _[[conditions/Cowering|cowering]]_, _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_, or _[[conditions/Panicked|panicked]]_ condition, that condition causes you to act as if _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ instead of imposing its normal effects. In addition, whenever you attempt a skill check (normally Intimidate) to demoralize an opponent, you gain a +3 bonus on the check.
