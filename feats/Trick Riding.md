# Trick Riding (Combat)

You are not only skilled at controlling a _[[monsters/Horse|horse]]_ in combat; you can make it look like art.

**Prerequisites:** Ride 9 ranks, _[[feats/Mounted Combat|Mounted Combat]]_.

**Benefit:** While wearing light or no armor, you do not need to make Ride skill checks for any task listed in the Ride skill with a DC of 15 or lower. You do not take a -5 penalty for riding a _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_ bareback. You can make a check using _Mounted Combat_ to negate a hit on your _mount_ twice per round instead of just once.
