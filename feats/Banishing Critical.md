# Banishing Critical (Combat, Critical)

With your combination of combat and spellcasting prowess, you send otherworldly monsters back to their place of origin.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Critical Focus|Critical Focus]]_, ability to cast _[[spells/Dismissal|dismissal]]_ or _[[spells/Banishment|banishment]]_, caster level 9th.

**Benefit:** When you confirm a critical hit with a slashing or bludgeoning weapon, you may cast _dismissal_ or _banishment_ on that target as an immediate action, and the target takes a -4 penalty on its Will save to resist the spell's effect. You must have _dismissal_ or _banishment_ prepared or otherwise available to cast, and using this ability casts the corresponding spell.
