# Crippling Critical (Combat,Critical)

You are able to maim a target and _[[feats/Hinder|hinder]]_ its movement.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Critical Focus|Critical Focus]]_, base attack bonus +13.

**Benefit:** Whenever you score a critical hit against an opponent, its speed is halved for 1 minute. A successful Fortitude save reduces this duration to 1d4 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. Against creatures with multiple types of movement, you must choose which movement type to affect. A flying creature hit by this attack must make a DC 10 Fly check to remain airborne, and has its maneuverability reduced by one step.

**Special:** You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess _[[feats/Critical Mastery|Critical Mastery]]_.
