# Kraken Throttle (Combat, Style)

You tighten your grip around your target's throat.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 13, _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Kraken Style|Kraken Style]]_, base attack bonus +5 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 5th.

**Benefit:** The damage that you deal with the _Kraken Style_ feat on a successful grapple combat maneuver check increases to an amount equal to your Wisdom bonus + 2. While using this style, you can choke your opponent when you successfully maintain a grapple instead of choosing to damage, move, pin, or tie up your opponent. This suffocates your opponent (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 445). The _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ opponent can take a breath during any round in which you do not maintain the grapple.
