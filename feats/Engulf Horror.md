# Engulf Horror (Combat, Monster)

The repulsive horror of your smothering attack nearly incapacitates most foes.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Engulf Revulsion|Engulf Revulsion]]_; _[[universal monster rules/Engulf|engulf]]_ or _[[universal monster rules/Smother|smother]]_ universal monster ability.

**Benefit:** When you successfully _engulf_ or _smother_ an opponent, successfully maintain a grapple combat maneuver on a smothered opponent, the opponent must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Strength modifier) or become _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effect.
