# Touch Of Evil

You instill unbidden thoughts and desires into another with your touch.

**Prerequisites:** Channel negative energy 6d6, evil alignment.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ three uses of your channel negative energy and make a melee touch attack against a target. You can attempt an opposed Sleight of Hand check against the target's Perception to make this attack without the target noticing. If the attack hits, the target gets a Will save (DC=10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier). On a failed save, you implant a _[[spells/Suggestion|suggestion]]_ into the creature's mind. This works similar to the _suggestion_ spell, however, you can suggest to the creature to commit a harmful or destructive act against another creature or object. If you choose the latter, the creature attempts to carry out the _suggestion_ in 1d6+1 days as it thinks over the _suggestion_ and plans it out. The creature can attempt another Will save at the original DC to resist the _suggestion_ right before it carries it out. If it fails the save, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus on one die roll used in carrying out the _suggestion_. This relentless planning causes the creature 1 point of Wisdom damage (or 1d6 sanity damage, if you are using that system), until the _suggestion_ is carried out.
