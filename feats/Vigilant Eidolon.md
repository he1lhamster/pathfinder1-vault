# Vigilant Eidolon

Your eidolon is highly observant, and its link with you increases your own watchfulness.

**Prerequisites:** Eidolon class feature.

**Benefit:** While your eidolon is within your reach, you gain a +4 bonus on Perception checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Perception, this bonus increases to +8. This does not apply if your eidolon is _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ or _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_.
