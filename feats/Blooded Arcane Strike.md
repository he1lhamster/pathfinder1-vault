# Blooded Arcane Strike (Combat)

Arcane energy guides your devastating attack.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Arcane Strike|Arcane Strike]]_, ability to cast arcane spells, bloodrage class feature.

**Benefit:** While you are bloodraging, you don't need to spend a swift action to use your Arcane Strike-it is always in effect. When you use this ability with _[[feats/Vital Strike|Vital Strike]]_, _[[feats/Improved Vital Strike|Improved Vital Strike]]_, or _[[feats/Greater Vital Strike|Greater Vital Strike]]_, the bonus on damage rolls for _Arcane Strike_ is multiplied by the number of times (two, three, or four) you roll damage dice for one of those feats.
