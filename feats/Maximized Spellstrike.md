# Maximized Spellstrike

You deal brutal damage against opponents caught unawares.

**Prerequisites:** Maximized magic _[[classes/Magus|magus]]_ arcana, weapon expertise class feature or _[[feats/Quick Draw|Quick Draw]]_.

**Benefit:** When you make a melee attack and successfully use your spellstrike ability against an opponent denied his Dexterity bonus to AC, you can spend 3 points from your arcane pool to maximize the spell delivered through your spellstrike as if using the _[[feats/Maximize Spell|Maximize Spell]]_ metamagic feat.
