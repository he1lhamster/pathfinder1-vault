# Weapon Of The Chosen (Combat)

The inf luence of your deity guides your favored weapon.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ with deity's favored weapon, must worship and receive spells from a deity.

**Benefit:** As a swift action, you can call upon your deity to guide an attack you make with your deity's favored weapon. On your next attack in that round with that weapon, your weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_ or striking an _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ creature. If your attack misses because of concealment, you can reroll your miss chance one time to see whether you actually hit.
