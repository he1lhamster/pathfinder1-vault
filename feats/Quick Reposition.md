# Quick Reposition (Combat)

Your opponent becomes an unwitting dance partner, following your lead while you fight.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Improved Reposition|Improved Reposition]]_, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** On your turn, you can perform a single reposition combat maneuver (Advanced Players Guide 320) in place of one of your melee attacks. You must choose the melee attack with the highest base attack bonus to make the reposition.

**Normal:** A reposition combat maneuver is a standard action.
