# Hand's Autonomy

Your _[[feats/Possessed Hand|possessed hand]]_ can act independently.

**Prerequisites:** _Possessed Hand_.

**Benefit:** You reduce the penalties for fighting with two weapons (including fighting with double weapons or when _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Throwing|throwing]]_ weapons from each hand) by 2, to a minimum penalty of -1. This benefit stacks with the _[[feats/Two-Weapon Fighting|Two-Weapon Fighting]]_ feat. When you are _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_, _[[conditions/Paralyzed|paralyzed]]_, asleep, or _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_, your _possessed hand_ can still act on your behalf in a limited fashion. The hand uses your statistics when performing any action in this manner. The hand can't take attacks of opportunity, but can draw attacks of opportunity from actions it takes. The hand can perform the following actions each turn on your initiative count. • The hand can retrieve or pick up an item or weapon as a standard action. • The hand can attempt any of the following skill checks at a -4 penalty: Disable Device, Escape Artist, _[[spells/Heal|Heal]]_, Sleight of Hand, or Use Magic Device. • The hand can _[[spells/Knock|knock]]_ you _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ as a free action, and drag you while you're _prone_ at a speed of 5 feet as a full-round action. • The hand can perform any other action appropriate for a hand and an arm, such as pouring a held potion into your mouth or awakening you from a sleep spell. • The hand can make a single melee or ranged attack with a light or one-handed weapon as a full-round action.
