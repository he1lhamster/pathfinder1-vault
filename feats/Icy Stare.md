# Icy Stare

Your eyes _[[universal monster rules/Burn|burn]]_ like ice, allowing you to _[[universal monster rules/Freeze|freeze]]_ and weaken foes with a glance.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Born Of Frost|Born of Frost]]_, frost giant.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can direct your _[[feats/Icy Stare|icy stare]]_ against a single creature or object within 10 feet. Targeted creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or take 1d6 points of cold damage. Unattended objects cannot attempt a saving throw. Creatures damaged by the spell must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage. This feat doesn't grant an actual _[[universal monster rules/Gaze|gaze]]_ attack-foes and allies are not in danger simply by meeting your _gaze_.
