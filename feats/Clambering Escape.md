# Clambering Escape (Combat)

You can escape an area effect by _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Throwing|throwing]]_ an enemy in its path to _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ yourself.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, Improved RepositionAPG, evasion class feature.

**Benefit:** When you successfully use your evasion class feature to avoid taking damage from an effect that allows a Ref lex saving throw, you can attempt a special repositionAPG combat maneuver check against any one foe within reach as an immediate action. If successful, you switch positions with the target of your combat maneuver. If your foe was not initially within range of the effect that you evaded, it must save against the effect as if it had been within the area of effect.
