# Janni Rush (Combat)

When you leap to the attack, your blows are like bolts from on high.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Janni Style|Janni Style]]_, _[[feats/Janni Tempest|Janni Tempest]]_, Acrobatics 8 ranks, Perform (dance) 8 ranks.

**Benefit:** While using _Janni Style_, you are always considered to have a running start when jumping. Further, if you _[[spells/Jump|jump]]_ as part of a charge and make an unarmed strike against the designated opponent, a hit allows you to roll the unarmed strike's damage dice twice and add the results together before adding modifiers (such as from Strength) or extra dice (such as precision-based damage or dice from weapon abilities). The extra damage dice are not multiplied on a successful critical hit.
