# Deep Toxin

You can deliver poisons deep into a foe's flesh.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Vital Strike|Vital Strike]]_; base attack bonus +6; Craft (poison) 6 ranks or poison use class feature.

**Benefit:** When you use a poisoned weapon to make a _Vital Strike_, you increase the poison's duration by one frequency increment (for example, a dose of _[[poisons/Large Scorpion Venom|large scorpion venom]]_ would last for 7 rounds instead of 6 and a dose of _[[poisons/Drow poison|drow poison]]_ would last for 3 minutes instead of 2). The poison takes effect immediately and does not have an onset time.
