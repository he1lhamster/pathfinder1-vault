# Gaze To Ray (Monster)

The creature can use its _[[universal monster rules/Gaze|gaze]]_ attack as a ray.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _gaze_ attack.

**Benefit:** The creature can project its _gaze_ attack as a ray of energy to a range of 30 feet. This requires the creature to succeed at a ranged touch attack to affect an opponent. A creature hit by the ray suffers the effects just as if it had met the creature's _gaze_ (if the _gaze_ allows a save, the opponent gets its save to avoid its effects). After using this feat, the creature cannot use its _gaze_ attack (that is, its _gaze_ attack effectively "turns off") for 1d4 rounds and it is disoriented during this time (-2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks). For example, normally to be affected by a _[[monsters/Medusa|medusa]]_'s _gaze_, a creature must meet the _medusa_'s _gaze_. Using this feat, the _medusa_ can project a ray of petrification to a range of 30 feet. If it hits the target, the creature receives a Fortitude save. If the save fails, the creature is turned to stone (just as if it had met the _medusa_'s _gaze_). Regardless of whether the ray hits or whether the creature saves, the _medusa_ cannot use its _gaze_ attack for 1d4 rounds (and it is disoriented). Creatures viewing the _medusa_ during this time are not required to make a save (since the _medusa_'s _gaze_ weapon is effectively "off").
