# Sisterhood Style (Combat, Style)

The _[[monsters/Gray|Gray]]_ Maidens are more than just soldiers-they _[[items/Mundane/Drill|drill]]_ relentlessly to fight as a team and to protect their bodies and minds. A _[[npcs/Gray Maiden|Gray Maiden]]_ using the _[[feats/Sisterhood Style|Sisterhood Style]]_ can easily coordinate tactics with other women.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, _[[feats/Shield Focus|Shield Focus]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_[[items/Weapon/Longsword|longsword]]_), base attack bonus +2.

**Benefit:** While using this style and wielding a _longsword_ and a light or heavy _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_, you gain a +1 bonus on Reflex and Will saving throws. In addition, when you enter the _Sisterhood Style_ stance, you can choose a teamwork feat you have. As a swift action, you can grant that feat to an ally within 10 feet until the beginning of your next turn.
