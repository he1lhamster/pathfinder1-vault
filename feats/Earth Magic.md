**Prerequisites:** Ability to cast 1st-level spells, favored terrain class feature.

**Benefit:** While in your favored terrain, your effective caster level increases by 1 for the purposes of improving spell effects dependent on caster level. This increase in effective caster level doesn't grant you access to more spells.
