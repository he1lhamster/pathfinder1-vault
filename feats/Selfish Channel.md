# Selfish Channel

You can hoard channeled energy for yourself.

**Prerequisites:** Channel energy class feature.

**Benefit:** Whenever you channel positive energy to _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ creatures, you regain half again as many hit points (+50%) as normal if you're the only creature healed by the channeled energy (either because there are no other living creatures within the area or because you exclude them with _[[feats/Selective Channeling|Selective Channeling]]_ or a similar effect).

**Special:** If you are healed by negative energy, this feat applies when you channel negative energy and you're the only creature healed by the channeled energy.
