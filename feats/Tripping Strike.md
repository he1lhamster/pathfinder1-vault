# Tripping Strike (Combat)

The force intrinsic to your critical hits can _[[spells/Knock|knock]]_ your foes down.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Improved Trip|Improved Trip]]_, base attack bonus +9.

**Benefit:** Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ your opponent, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds your opponent's CMD, you may _knock_ your opponent _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ as if from the _trip_ combat maneuver. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If you are tripped during your own _trip_ attempt, you can drop your weapon to avoid being tripped.

**Normal:** You must perform a _trip_ combat maneuver to _trip_ an opponent.

**Special:** You can only apply the effects of one of the following feats to a given critical hit: _[[feats/Bull Rush Strike|Bull Rush Strike]]_, _[[feats/Disarming Strike|Disarming Strike]]_, _[[feats/Repositioning Strike|Repositioning Strike]]_, _[[feats/Sundering Strike|Sundering Strike]]_, or _[[feats/Tripping Strike|Tripping Strike]]_. You may choose to use this feat after you make your confirmation roll.
