# Profane Studies

Your study of fiends grants you advantages when summoning or fighting them.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, Knowledge (planes) 4 ranks, ability to cast a _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ monster spell.

**Benefit:** You gain a +5 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks involving evil outsiders. Additionally, when you cast a _summon_ monster spell to _summon_ an evil outsider, treat your caster level as 2 levels higher for the purpose of determining the duration.
