# Legionnaire's Inspiration

You inspire your comrades to stand against impossible odds.

**Prerequisites:** Affiliated with the Golden Legion.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can select one creature you can see. All allies within 30 feet who are able to see and hear you gain a +1 morale bonus to their Armor Class against that creature for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1 round). You can do this once per day, plus one additional time for every 3 character levels you have.
