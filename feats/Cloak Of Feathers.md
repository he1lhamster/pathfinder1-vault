# Cloak Of Feathers

You have learned to _[[spells/Blend|blend]]_ in with wingless humanoids, and as long as you are not flying, you can fold your wings in a manner that resembles a cloak or robe.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, _[[monsters/Strix|strix]]_.

**Benefit:** When you fold your wings, you gain a +2 bonus on Disguise checks to pose as a human, and ignore the penalties for disguising yourself as a different race while doing so. Additionally, you can hide one small item within your wings' folds (such as a potion, a wand, a weapon weighing 1 pound or less, or a similarly sized item at your GM's discretion). Any such hidden item requires a successful DC 25 Perception check for others to notice. You can retrieve this item with a swift action, but unfolding your wings causes it to drop to the ground.
