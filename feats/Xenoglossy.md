# Xenoglossy

People everywhere share a common tongue; they just don't always remember it.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, Linguistics 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** With a successful DC 25 Linguistics check, you can speak with a single individual with whom you share no common languages. You cannot take 10 on this check, nor can anyone aid you. You believe you are speaking your native language, and the listener believes you are speaking its native language; however, to everyone else able to hear you, you sound like you are speaking gibberish. Creatures that have truespeech or that are under the effects of _[[spells/Tongues|tongues]]_ can understand _[[feats/Xenoglossy|Xenoglossy]]_, and other creatures who succeed at a DC 25 Linguistics check can pick up the gist of what you are saying. _Xenoglossy_ lasts for the length of the conversation or for 1 minute per level, whichever is shorter. You can use _Xenoglossy_ again to continue a longer conversation, and you gain a +2 on Linguistics checks to use _Xenoglossy_ to communicate with someone with whom you previously communicated using this feat. If you fail a _Xenoglossy_ check, you can't use the _Xenoglossy_ feat to attempt further communication with that creature until you gain additional ranks in Linguistics.
