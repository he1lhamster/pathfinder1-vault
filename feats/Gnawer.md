# Gnawer

Thanks to your teeth's strength and quick growth, you are able to chew through nearly any obstacle given sufficient time.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Sharptooth|Sharptooth]]_*, _[[monsters/Ratfolk|ratfolk]]_.

**Benefit:** Damage dealt by your bite attack ignores an amount of hardness equal to 3 plus half your character level. You can spend a full-round action to deal double your bite damage to an unattended, inanimate object.

**Special:** If you have the _[[feats/Burrowing Teeth|Burrowing Teeth]]_ feat (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide 154), you can _[[universal monster rules/Burrow|burrow]]_ through solid stone at a speed of 5 feet per 10 minutes.
