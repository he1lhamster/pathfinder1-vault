Gozreh has seen fit to _[[spells/Bless|bless]]_ you as an uncommonly skilled swimmer.

**Prerequisites:** Worshiper of Gozreh.

**Benefit:** When you succeed at a Swim check, you can move your full speed as a full-round action or half your speed as a move action. This does not grant you the benefit of having a swim speed.

**Normal:** A successful Swim check allows you to move up to half your speed as a full-round action or up to a quarter your speed as a move action.
