# Mounted Combat (Combat)

You are adept at guiding your _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_ through combat.

**Prerequisites:** Ride 1 rank.

**Benefit:** Once per round when your _mount_ is hit in combat, you may attempt a Ride check (as an immediate action) to negate the hit. The hit is negated if your Ride check result is greater than the opponent's attack roll.
