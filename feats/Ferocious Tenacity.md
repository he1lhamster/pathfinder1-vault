# Ferocious Tenacity (Combat)

You spit in the face of death.

**Prerequisites:** Half-orc or _[[monsters/Orc|orc]]_, _[[universal monster rules/Ferocity|ferocity]]_ racial trait, _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ class feature.

**Benefit:** When raging, if you are hit by an attack that would deal enough hit points of damage to kill you (negative hit points equal to your Constitution score), as an immediate action you may _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ 1 or more rounds of _rage_ to negate some of this damage and keep yourself alive. Each round of _rage_ you spend reduces the attack's damage by your raging Constitution bonus, but cannot reduce the damage taken below 1 hit point.
