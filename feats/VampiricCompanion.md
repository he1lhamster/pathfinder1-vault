# VampiricCompanion

Just as your undead existence mocks nature, so too are you granted a twisted companion that reflects the vile nature of vampirism.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Dhampir|Dhampir]]_ or _[[monsters/Vampire|vampire]]_, nongood alignment, 10 levels in a class that grants a familiar or animal companion.

**Benefit:** Your animal companion or familiar's type changes to "undead." The creature gains your _vampire_ or _dhampir_ weaknesses and _[[universal monster rules/Fast Healing|fast healing]]_ 5. If you are a _vampire_, the creature also gains the following abilities, depending on what type of _vampire_ you are. Jiang-Shi: If the creature is adjacent to you or you are sharing a square, it gains the benefit of your _[[spells/Prayer|prayer]]_ scroll ability. The creature crumbles into dust if destroyed ( just like a jiang-shi), but is not permanently destroyed unless measures are taken that would destroy a jiang-shi. Moroi: If the creature is adjacent to or in your square when you assume _[[spells/Gaseous Form|gaseous form]]_, it transforms with you and follows you; its _[[spells/Transformation|transformation]]_ ends when yours does. If reduced to 0 hit points, it is forced into _gaseous form_ and must return to your coffin to reform (or the foot of your coffin if it cannot fit within it). Nosferatu: If the creature is adjacent to or in your square when you assume swarm form, it transforms with you and follows you; its _transformation_ ends when yours does. The creature can climb as if using _[[spells/Spider Climb|spider climb]]_, even if its anatomy is not suitable for climbing (such as a _[[monsters/Horse|horse]]_). Vetala: The creature may use malevolence and _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_ as if it were a vetala, but by touch and only affecting creatures or corpses that are the same type of creature as the animal companion or familiar (such as bear, _horse_, or snake). If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, the creature is _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ and its _fast healing_ ceases to function for 1 hour (additional damage or desecration has no effect); after 1 hour it regains 1 hit point and is no longer _helpless_, and its _fast healing_ resumes. It can be permanently destroyed as if it were a vetala.

**Special:** If your animal companion or familiar is destroyed, dismissed, or lost, you may apply the effects of this feat to the replacement creature. If you are destroyed, the creature retains its undead type but loses all other special abilities from this feat. If you have more than one animal companion or familiar, choose one of them when you select this feat and apply its effects to that creature. You may select this feat more than once. Each time you select the feat, it applies to a different animal companion or familiar.
