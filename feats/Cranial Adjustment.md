# Cranial Adjustment

You have learned to manually adjust the plates that make up the skull, inducing altered states in your subjects.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Deft Hands|Deft Hands]]_ or _[[feats/Trepanation|Trepanation]]_.

**Benefit:** You can perform the _[[spells/Hypnotism|hypnotism]]_ occult skill unlockOA even if you can't use _[[universal monster rules/Psychic Magic|psychic magic]]_. If you can cast _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ spells or have the _Psychic_ SensitivityOA feat, you can use _hypnotism_ one additional time per day. You can use the Sleight of Hand skill in place of Diplomacy to hypnotize a subject, but doing so requires 10 minutes of contact with the target's skull. You can perform an adjustment that takes 1 hour to access the deeper recesses of a target's emotional mind, either granting the target a +2 bonus or imposing a -2 penalty on the target's saving throws against mind-affecting emotionUM effects for 24 hours.
