# Fateful Channel

Your faith not only heals the body, it tugs the strands of fate.

**Prerequisites:** Channel positive energy 3d6, worshiper of Pharasma.

**Benefit:** When you channel positive energy to _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ living creatures, you grant each creature you _heal_ the ability to roll twice and take the better result on a single attack roll, skill check, or saving throw of their choice within a number of rounds equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1). Multiple uses of this ability do not stack, but they do reset the effect's duration. A creature can only benefit from one instance of this channel effect at a time.
