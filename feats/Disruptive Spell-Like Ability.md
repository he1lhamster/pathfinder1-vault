# Disruptive Spell-Like Ability (Monster)

Your spell-like ability clings to affected targets and interferes with their spellcasting.

**Prerequisites:** Spell-like ability at caster level 4th or higher.

**Benefit:** Choose one of your _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a _[[feats/Disruptive Spell-Like Ability|disruptive spell-like ability]]_ up to three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). For 1 round after you use a _disruptive spell-like ability_, affected targets attempting to cast as spell must attempt concentration checks when casting spells or use _spell-like abilities_ (DC = the _disruptive spell-like ability_'s DC + the level of the spell the target is casting or spell-like ability it's using). Targets that avoid the spell-like ability's effects also avoid this feat's effect. You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 1. For a summary, see Table 3-1.

**Special:** This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time you do, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.
