# Mutual Hatred (Combat)

Others hate you, and their hatred feeds your own.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against creatures whose hatred racial trait or favored enemy class feature applies to you. For instance, an _[[monsters/Orc|orc]]_ would gain this bonus against all dwarves and against rangers who chose humanoid (_orc_) as a favored enemy.
