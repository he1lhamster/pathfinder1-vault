# Masked Intent

Your masked face makes your intentions nearly impossible to discern.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Nameless One|Nameless One]]_.

**Benefit:** While you're benefiting from the _Nameless One_ feat, your intentions become difficult to read. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on opposed Bluff checks, and increase the DC by 4 of checks to gather information about you using Diplomacy, to answer questions about you or your abilities or weaknesses using the appropriate Knowledge skill, or to _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ any spells or _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ that you cast using Spellcraft. If you have 10 or more ranks in any of these skills, the bonus for that skill or increase to that DC increases to +8.
