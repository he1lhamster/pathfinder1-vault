# Disheartening Display (Combat)

Your show of prowess further demoralizes others.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Dazzling Display|Dazzling Display]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_, base attack bonus +6, proficiency with chosen weapon.

**Benefit:** When you successfully use _Dazzling Display_ against any _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_, _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_, or _[[conditions/Panicked|panicked]]_ opponents, their _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ increases by one step. An already _panicked_ creature demoralized by this feat cowers. Once affected by this feat, a creature cannot be affected by it again (by you or anyone else) for 24 hours.
