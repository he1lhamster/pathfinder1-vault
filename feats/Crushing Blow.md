# Crushing Blow (Combat)

Your focus allows you to _[[feats/Smash|smash]]_ your enemy's defenses.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Stunning Fist|Stunning Fist]]_.

**Benefit:** You can make a _Stunning Fist_ attempt as a full-round action.

This penalty does not stack with other penalties applied due to _[[feats/Crushing Blow|Crushing Blow]]_.
