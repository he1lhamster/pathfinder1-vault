# Maddening Obliteration (Combat)

With a mighty killing blow, your unsettling punch vaporizes your foe.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 19, Cha 15, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Maddening Strike|Maddening Strike]]_, _[[feats/Maddening Style|Maddening Style]]_, _[[feats/Stunning Fist|Stunning Fist]]_, Knowledge (arcana) 10 ranks, ki pool class feature, nongood alignment.

**Benefit:** When you damage a living creature with an unarmed strike while using _Maddening Style_, and you have at least 1 point in your ki pool, that creature suffers a -2 penalty on saving throws against any _[[spells/Confusion|confusion]]_, madness, and _[[spells/Insanity|insanity]]_ effects (including your _Maddening Strike_) for 1 round. Additionally, if you reduce a creature to fewer than 0 hit points with a _Stunning Fist_ attack, you can spend 2 points from your ki pool as a free action to obliterate your opponent, reducing their body to fine dust as per _[[spells/Disintegrate|disintegrate]]_. A living creature can attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier) to negate this effect.
