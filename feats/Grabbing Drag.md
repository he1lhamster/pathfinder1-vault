# Grabbing Drag (Combat)

You can move easily with a _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ enemy in tow.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Grabbing Style|Grabbing Style]]_, _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_; base attack bonus +8, _[[classes/Brawler|brawler]]_ level 4th, or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 4th.

**Benefit:** When you are using _Grabbing Style_, if you use the move grapple action, you can move both yourself and a single target that you're grappling your full speed instead of half your speed. After you have done so, you can use a move action to move yourself and the target of your grapple half your speed without needing to attempt an additional combat maneuver check. You cannot use this feat if you are grappling two targets.
