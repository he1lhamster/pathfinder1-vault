# Kinetic Leap

Kinetic energy propels you when you _[[spells/Jump|jump]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Acrobatics 3 ranks, kinetic blast class feature.

**Benefit:** Once per day as a swift action, you can conjure a burst of energy from your kinetic blast to help you _jump_ a long distance, adding a +10 bonus on your Acrobatics check to _jump_; if you have at least 10 ranks in Acrobatics, the bonus increases to +20. By accepting 1 point of _[[universal monster rules/Burn|burn]]_, you can use this ability at will until your _burn_ is removed.
