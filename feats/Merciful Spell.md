# Merciful Spell (Metamagic)

Your damaging spells subdue rather than kill.

**Benefit:** You can alter spells that inflict damage to inflict nonlethal damage instead. Spells that inflict damage of a particular type (such as fire) inflict nonlethal damage of that same type. A _[[feats/Merciful Spell|merciful spell]]_ does not use up a higher-level spell slot than the spell's actual level.
