# Letter Fury

You go wild when someone tries to steal the words from your head.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Goblin|Goblin]]_, _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ class feature.

**Benefit:** If someone reads or writes in your presence (including casting spells like _[[spells/Glyph Of Warding|glyph of warding]]_ or symbol) you can, as an immediate action, choose to activate your _rage_ class ability for 1 round. This round of _rage_ does not count toward the total number of rounds which you can _rage_ each day, but if you _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ to continue your _rage_ beyond that single round you must _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ rounds from your daily _rage_ allotment as normal. Once you use this feat you must wait at least 1 minute after you cease raging before you can use it again.
