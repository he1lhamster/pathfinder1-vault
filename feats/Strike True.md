# Strike True (Combat)

Rather than attempting a series of wild blows, you line up a perfect attack.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** You can focus yourself as a move action. When focused, you gain a +4 bonus on your next melee attack roll before the end of your turn.
