# Rugged Northerner

You live a hard life in a cold climate, and after enduring the hardships of many brutal winters, you've gained some benefit from the frozen environs.

**Prerequisites:** Con 13, Survival 1 rank.

**Benefit:** You treat extreme cold conditions (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 442) as severe cold, and severe cold as cold weather conditions. You are not impacted at all by normal cold weather conditions. In addition, you do not become _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_ by _[[spells/Frostbite|frostbite]]_ or hypothermia.

**Special:** This feat is unaffiliated-a character need not be affiliated with the Mammoth Lords to select this feat.
