# Disrupting Fist (Combat)

Your powerful fists can reduce undead foes to dust.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Channel Smite|Channel Smite]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +9, channel positive energy 4d6.

**Benefit:** On a confirmed critical hit using an unarmed strike against an undead creature, you can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ two uses of your channel energy ability as a swift action to destroy that undead creature. The undead creature can negate this effect with a successful Will saving throw (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus).
