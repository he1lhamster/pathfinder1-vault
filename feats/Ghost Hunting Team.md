# Ghost Hunting Team

Your loathing of undead is so great that even your allies can feel it.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Duskwalker|Duskwalker]]_, _[[monsters/Ghost|ghost]]_ _[[classes/Hunter|hunter]]_ racial trait.

**Benefit:** When you use your _ghost_ _hunter_ ability to grant your weapons the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]]_ special ability, you can also affect the weapons of allies within 30 feet of you. You can activate _ghost_ _hunter_ an additional time each day.
