# Darkness Trick

You can manipulate the luminescence of magic weapons.

**Prerequisites:** Use Magic Device 5 ranks, ability to cast _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_.

**Benefit:** When wielding a _[[spells/Magic Weapon|magic weapon]]_ that sheds light or that features a luminescent quality, such as a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Flaming|flaming]]_ or _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Brilliant Energy|brilliant energy]]_ weapon, you can deactivate that illumination as a swift action. You can reignite the illumination at any time as a free action. Any intrinsic magic properties that would force the weapon to shed light, such as the extra damage of a _flaming_ weapon, do not function while the illumination is deactivated, and the "significant portion" of a _brilliant energy_ weapon that is normally made of light ceases to exist. If a weapon affected by this ability ever leaves your _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_ (for instance, if you drop the weapon or pass it to another creature), its illumination and related abilities instantly return.
