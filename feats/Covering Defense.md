# Covering Defense (Combat)

You are skilled at protecting yourself and your allies with your _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Shield Focus|Shield Focus]]_, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** When you use the total defense action while using a light, heavy, or _[[items/Shield/Tower shield|tower shield]]_, you can provide a cover bonus to AC against all attacks to an adjacent ally your size or smaller. This cover bonus is equal to your _shield_'s _shield_ bonus and lasts until the beginning of your next turn. Your _shield_ does not provide a cover bonus to Ref lex saves.
