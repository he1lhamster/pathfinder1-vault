# Seething Hatred (Combat)

You've learned to channel your hatred of a particular type of creature into a _[[feats/Devastating Strike|devastating strike]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Studied target class feature.

**Benefit:** Select a creature type from the _[[classes/Ranger|Ranger]]_ Favored Enemies table (Core Rulebook 64). When you designate a creature of this type as your studied target and hit it with a melee or ranged weapon attack, your favored target bonus on damage rolls against it is doubled.
