# Heaven's Step (Combat)

Like the daring _[[feats/Heaven's Step|Heaven's Step]]_ Offensive championed by Grand Prince Gennaris III of Taldor, you confidently take the fight to your enemy and strike an unexpected blow.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15, Following StepAPG, _[[feats/Step Up|Step Up]]_, _Step Up_ and StrikeAPG, _[[feats/Two-Weapon Fighting|Two-Weapon Fighting]]_, base attack bonus +10.

**Benefit:** When you make an attack using _[[feats/Step Up and Strike|Step Up and Strike]]_, you can also make an extra attack with your off-hand weapon using your highest base attack bonus. Both attacks take the normal penalties for _two-weapon fighting_.
