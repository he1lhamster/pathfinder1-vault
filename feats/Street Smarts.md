# Street Smarts

You are able to navigate the streets and personalities of whatever locale you run across.

**Benefit:** You get a +2 bonus on Knowledge (local) and Sense Motive checks, and Knowledge (local) is always a class skill for you. If you have 10 or more ranks in one of these skills, the bonus increases to +4 for that skill. The bonus on Sense Motive checks doesn't stack with _[[feats/Alertness|Alertness]]_.
