# Brisk Spell (Metamagic)

Your movement spells make allies swifter than normal.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13+.

**Benefit:** You can alter spells that grant a creature a movement type it doesn't normally have to increase the speed for that movement type by 10 feet. A _[[feats/Brisk Spell|brisk spell]]_ uses a spell slot equal to the spell's normal spell level.
