# Deadly Dealer

Your skill with handling a deck and your arcane talents allow you to turn mundane _[[items/Mundane/Cards|cards]]_ into weapons.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Arcane Strike|Arcane Strike]]_, Sleight of Hand 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** You can throw a card as though it were a _[[items/Weapon/Dart|dart]]_, with the same damage, range, and other features. You must use the _Arcane Strike_ feat when _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Throwing|throwing]]_ a card in this way, or else the card lacks the magical force and precision to deal lethal damage. A card is destroyed when thrown in this way. Harrow _cards_ are treated as masterwork weapons when thrown using this feat, but are still destroyed after they are thrown. A _[[items/Mundane/Harrow deck|harrow deck]]_ can no longer be used as a fortune-telling device after even a single card is thrown. A spellcaster with this feat can enhance a deck of _cards_ as though it were a ranged weapon with 54 pieces of ammunition. This enhancement functions only when used in tandem with this feat, and has no affect on any other way the _cards_ might be used. Only a character who possesses this feat can use an enhanced deck of _cards_; she must still use the _Arcane Strike_ feat to activate the _cards_' enhancement.
