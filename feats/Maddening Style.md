# Maddening Style (Combat, Style)

When you clobber an opponent with your fists, you inundate its mind with visions of madness and horror.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 15, Cha 11, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Stunning Fist|Stunning Fist]]_, Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks, ki pool class feature, nongood alignment.

**Benefit:** You gain one additional use of _Stunning Fist_ per day. When using this style, if you have at least 1 point in your ki pool, you increase the DCs of your _[[spells/Confusion|confusion]]_, madness, and _[[spells/Insanity|insanity]]_ effects (including _[[feats/Maddening Strike|Maddening Strike]]_) by 1. Additionally, when you successfully stun an opponent with your _Stunning Fist_ attack, your target takes 1 point of Wisdom damage.

**Special:** If you are using the sanity system (page 12), when you successfully stun an opponent with your _Stunning Fist_ attack, the target takes 1d4 points of sanity damage instead of 1 point of Wisdom damage.
