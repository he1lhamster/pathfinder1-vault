# Prosperity And Pride (Story)

Your family has raised cities and mastered trade, and you seek to do the same.

**Prerequisites:** Be a member of House Corcina, or have the Craftsperson, Inheritance, Well-Connected Friend, or Worldshaker background.

**Benefit:** When in a settlement the size of a large city or smaller, you receive a +2 bonus on Appraise checks and Diplomacy checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in one of these skills, the bonus on that skill increases to +4.

**Goal:** Your actions must spur a settlement to grow to the next size category (Pathfinder RPG Gamemastery Guide 204); this usually involves decisively defeating a challenging foe or an appropriate number of foes preying upon or impeding the settlement's citizenry.

**Completion Benefit:** You teach others how to get the most out of their equipment. Three times per day as a standard action, you can increase the armor bonus provided by a suit of nonmagical armor, the circumstance bonus to a skill provided by a tool or skill kit (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 76), or the _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ bonus provided by a nonmagical _shield_ by 1. This bonus lasts for 1 hour and doesn't stack with other uses of this ability.
