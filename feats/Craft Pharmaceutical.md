# Craft Pharmaceutical

You can craft pharmaceuticals.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Technologist|Technologist]]_, _[[spells/Heal|Heal]]_ 9 ranks, Knowledge (nature) 9 ranks

**Benefit:** You can create any pharmaceutical or poison. Creating a pharmaceutical takes 2 hours if its base price is 250 gp or less; otherwise, the creation of the pharmaceutical takes 1 day for every 1,000 gp in its price. To create the pharmaceutical or poison, you must use up raw materials costing half of this total price. See Crafting High-Tech Items on page 16 for more information.
