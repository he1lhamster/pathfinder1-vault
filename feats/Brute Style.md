# Brute Style (Combat, Style)

Through strength, study, and intense inner reflection, you have become an expert at battering _[[monsters/Fallen|fallen]]_ opponents.

**Prerequisites:** Str 15, Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_, _[[feats/Improved Overrun|Improved Overrun]]_, _[[feats/Improved Trip|Improved Trip]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|Vicious]]_ StompUC, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** While using this style, you can use your _[[feats/Vicious Stomp|Vicious Stomp]]_ feat against any opponent within 10 feet of you, as long as it is within your natural reach. If you don't have the _Vicious Stomp_ feat, you gain no benefit from this feat.

**Normal:** The _Vicious Stomp_ feat only works against an opponent that falls _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ adjacent to you.
