Your powerful jaws and steely teeth are _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ enough to give you a bite attack.

**Prerequisites:** Half-orc.

**Benefit:** You can make a bite attack for 1d4 points of damage, plus your Strength modifier. You're considered proficient in this attack and can apply feats or effects appropriate to _[[universal monster rules/Natural Attacks|natural attacks]]_ to it. If used as part of a full attack action, the bite is considered a secondary attack and is made at your full base attack bonus -5, and adds half your Strength modifier to damage.
