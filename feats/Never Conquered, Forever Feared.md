# Never Conquered, Forever Feared (Story)

You are dauntless in battle, and your lineage echoes with awe-inspiring power.

**Prerequisites:** Be a member of House Heskillar, or have the Adopted by Dragons, Path of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Righteous|Righteous]]_ _[[spells/Rage|Rage]]_, or Proud Heritage background.

**Benefit:** Your stern demeanor gives you a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Intimidate, this bonus increases to +4. You also gain a +2 bonus on saves against _[[universal monster rules/Paralysis|paralysis]]_ and sleep effects.

**Goal:** You must individually slay an appropriate number of significant foes in succession, without retreating or withdrawing from a fight.

**Completion Benefit:** You can display your imposing presence as a free action when you take an offensive action, such as an attack or a charge. Opponents within 30 feet of you must succeed at a Will save or become _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 3d6 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier. This ability does not cause opponents that are already _shaken_ to become _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_, and opponents with more Hit Dice than your character level are immune to the effect. This is a mind-affecting _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effect.
