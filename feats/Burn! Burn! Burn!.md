# Burn! Burn! Burn!

You take the _[[monsters/Goblin|goblin]]_ love of arson and fire play to a whole new level.

**Prerequisites:** Disable Device 1 rank, _goblin_.

**Benefit:** You deal an extra 1d4 points of fire damage when you attack with fire from an alchemical or nonmagical source (such as with alchemical fire or torches) and gain a +4 competence bonus on Ref lex saving throws made to avoid catching on fire or to put yourself out when on fire. Additional damage caused by this feat does not apply to magical attacks (such as an _[[classes/Alchemist|alchemist]]_'s bomb) or to splash damage.
