# Staggering Critical (Combat, Critical)

Your critical hits cause opponents to _[[spells/Slow|slow]]_ down.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Critical Focus|Critical Focus]]_, base attack bonus +13.

**Benefit:** Whenever you score a critical hit, your opponent becomes _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful Fortitude save reduces the duration to 1 round. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. The effects of this feat do not stack. Additional hits instead add to the duration.

**Special:** You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess _[[feats/Critical Mastery|Critical Mastery]]_.
