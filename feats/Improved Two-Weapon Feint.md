# Improved Two-Weapon Feint (Combat)

Your primary weapon keeps a foe off balance, allowing you to slip your off-hand weapon past his defenses.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 17, Int 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_, _[[feats/Improved Two-Weapon Fighting|Improved Two-Weapon Fighting]]_, _[[feats/Two-Weapon Feint|Two-Weapon Feint]]_, _[[feats/Two-Weapon Fighting|Two-Weapon Fighting]]_, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** While using _Two-Weapon Fighting_ to make melee attacks, you can forgo your first primary-hand melee attack to make a Bluff check to feint an opponent. If you successfully feint, that opponent is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC until the end of your turn.
