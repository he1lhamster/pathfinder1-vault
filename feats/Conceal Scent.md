# Conceal Scent

You have learned the essential tricks of disguising your odor and keeping creatures from locating you by your _[[universal monster rules/Scent|scent]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Hide 3 ranks, Survival 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** Creatures cannot use the _scent_ ability to track you (though they can still track you through standard means such as footprints). Creatures with _scent_ can detect your presence by smell at half the normal distance, but cannot pinpoint your location with _scent_.
