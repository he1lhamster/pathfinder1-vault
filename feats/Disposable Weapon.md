# Disposable Weapon

You ignore the limitations of your equipment, striking harder despite the damage it does to your weapon.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +1, proficient with weapon.

**Benefit:** Whenever you use a melee or thrown weapon with the fragile weapon special quality to score a critical threat against an opponent, you can give your weapon the _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ condition to automatically conf irm the critical hit.
