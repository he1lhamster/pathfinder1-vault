# Evolved Familiar

Your familiar is different from others of its kind.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, Cha 13, familiar class feature.

**Benefit:** Select an evolution from the list of 1-point evolutions available to a _[[classes/Summoner|summoner]]_'s eidolon. Your familiar has this evolution. The familiar must conform to any limitations of the evolution. For instance, no familiars can benefit from the _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_ evolution and only familiars with wings can take the wing buffet evolution. If you gain a new familiar, your old familiar loses all evolutions, and you can select a new 1-point evolution for the new familiar.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack, granting a new 1-point evolution to your familiar each time you gain this feat.
