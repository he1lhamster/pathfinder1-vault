# Kinetic Crafting

You can use your wild talents to help you craft magic items.

**Prerequisites:** _[[classes/Kineticist|Kineticist]]_ level 3rd.

**Benefit:** When crafting a magic item or taking item creation feats, you can treat your _kineticist_ level as your caster level. In addition, you can treat any wild talent you have as a spell of the same level or lower for the purpose of fulfilling the requirements for magic item creation (except spell-completion and spell-trigger items). This wild talent must be associated with the same element or deal the same type of energy damage as the emulated spell's descriptor.
