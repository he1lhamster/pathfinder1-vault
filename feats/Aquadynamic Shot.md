# Aquadynamic Shot (Combat)

You use projectiles and special trick shots that lose less accuracy when _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Far Shot|Far Shot]]_, _[[feats/Point-Blank Shot|Point-Blank Shot]]_, base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit:** Your projectile attacks take a -1 penalty per 5 feet of water between you and the target. You still can't use thrown weapons effectively _underwater_ except in special circumstances (see page 44).

**Normal:** Projectile attacks _underwater_ take a -2 penalty per 5 feet of water between the shooter and the target.
