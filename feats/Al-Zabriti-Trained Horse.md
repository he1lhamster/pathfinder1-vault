# Al-Zabriti-Trained Horse

This _[[monsters/Horse|horse]]_ was trained by the Al-Zabriti tribespeople. It knows more tricks and is more loyal to its rider than most mounts.

**Prerequisites:** _Horse_.

**Benefit:** This _horse_ automatically knows the tricks included in the combat riding trick (attack, come, defend, down, _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_, and heel), and these tricks do not count against the normal maximum number of tricks the _horse_ can learn. The Handle Animal DC to get the _horse_ to perform a trick is reduced by 5, and the DC to teach the _horse_ new tricks is reduced by 5.
