# Efficient Focus Shift

You are more adept than most at shifting _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Mental Focus|mental focus]]_ between your implements.

**Prerequisites:** _[[classes/Occultist|Occultist]]_ level 7th.

**Benefit:** Twice per day when you shift _mental focus_ from one implement to another, you can add the same number of points to the latter implement that you removed from the former.

**Normal:** By removing points of _mental focus_ from one implement, you can add the same amount - 1 to another.

**Special:** You can take this feat multiple times. Its effects stack.
