# Aldori Artistry (CombAt)

You can do more with your blade than slash and stab.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Exotic Weapon Proficiency|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]]_ (_[[items/Weapon/Aldori _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Dueling|dueling]]_ sword|Aldori _dueling_ sword]]_), _[[feats/Weapon Finesse|Weapon Finesse]]_, base attack bonus +2.

**Benefit:** Choose one of the following combat maneuvers: disarm, repositionAPG, stealAPG, sunder, or _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_. You gain a +2 bonus when performing the selected maneuver while wielding an _Aldori _dueling_ sword_. This bonus does not stack with the bonus provided by a combat maneuver feat with "improved" in its name (such as _[[feats/Improved Trip|Improved Trip]]_).

**Special:** You can select this feat multiple times, choosing a different combat maneuver each time.
