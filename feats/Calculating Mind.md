# Calculating Mind

You see potential in the world around you that nobody else notices. Your numerological abilities are heightened by this uncommon aptitude.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Sacred Geometry|Sacred Geometry]]_, Knowledge (engineering) 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** Anytime you use the _Sacred Geometry_ feat, you can use d8s instead of d6s when rolling your dice pool. You can use any combination of d6s and d8s that you _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_, as long as the number of dice does not exceed the number of ranks you possess in Knowledge (engineering).
