# Monstrous Mount

You have learned how to tame and ride exotic beasts.

**Prerequisites:** Handle Animal 4 ranks; Ride 4 ranks; divine bond (_[[spells/Mount|mount]]_), _[[classes/Hunter|hunter]]_'s bond (animal companion), or _mount_ class feature with an effective _[[classes/Druid|druid]]_ level of 4.

**Benefit:** You can select an exotic beast from the list of monstrous mounts to serve as your animal companion or special _mount_. You acquire and advance this creature in the same way as the _mount_ or animal companion detailed in the class feature used as a prerequisite for this feat. You can also dismiss the creature as dictated by your class feature. You must meet additional prerequisites to choose a creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher, as described in each creature's entry.
