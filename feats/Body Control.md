You can directly manipulate your autonomic functions.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 11, _[[feats/Meditation Master|Meditation Master]]_.

**Benefit:** For 24 hours after you meditate, you gain a +1 bonus on Fortitude saving throws against poison, disease, starvation, and effects that would make you _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_ or _[[conditions/Exhausted|exhausted]]_. You need only half as much food to avoid starvation, half as much water to avoid dehydration, and half as much sleep to _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ injuries, avoid fatigue or exhaustion, and prepare spells.
