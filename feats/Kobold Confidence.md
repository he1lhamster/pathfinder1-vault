# Kobold Confidence

Your _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cunning|cunning]]_, confidence, or faith in the draconic power in your blood allows you to overcome your physical frailty.

**Prerequisites:** Charisma 13, _[[monsters/Kobold|kobold]]_.

**Benefit:** You use your Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom in place of Constitution to determine your bonus to Fortitude saves and your maximum negative hit points before death. Once this choice has been made, it can't be changed.
