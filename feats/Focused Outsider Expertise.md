# Focused Outsider Expertise (Combat)

You've learned to attack in a way that stymies the natural resistances common in outsiders.

**Prerequisites:** Favored enemy (outsider) class feature.

**Benefit:** Your weapon attacks ignore a number of points of _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_ equal to half your favored enemy (outsider [any one]) bonus. This feat allows you to ignore only _damage reduction_ that is normally bypassed by chaotic-, evil-, good-, or lawful-aligned weapons. Against outsiders that match your favored enemy subtype, the amount of _damage reduction_ and hardness you ignore is equal to your full favored class bonus.
