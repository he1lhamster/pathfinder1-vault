# Mighty Bite (Combat)

Your _[[feats/Rending Claws|rending claws]]_ expose your opponent's vital organs to your teeth.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +6, bite attack, _[[universal monster rules/Rend|rend]]_, _[[monsters/Troll|troll]]_.

**Benefit:** If you deal damage to a creature with your _rend_ ability, the critical threat range of your bite attack becomes 18-20 until the start of your next turn. This increase does not stack with other effects that increase your bite's critical threat range (such as the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Keen|keen]]_ weapon special ability or the _[[feats/Improved Critical|Improved Critical]]_ feat).
