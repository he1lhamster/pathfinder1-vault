# Smashing Dent (Combat)

Your _[[items/Mundane/Hammer|hammer]]_ strikes cause traumatic injuries.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Improved Sunder|Improved Sunder]]_, _[[feats/Smashing Crush|Smashing Crush]]_, _[[feats/Smashing Style|Smashing Style]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ with the chosen weapon, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** While using _Smashing Style_, each time you damage a suit of armor with a sunder combat maneuver, you reduce its armor bonus to its Armor Class by 1 and increase its armor check penalty by 1. Armor cannot have its armor bonus to AC reduced to less than 50% of its normal bonus or its armor check penalty more than doubled. These reductions and increases both end when the damage dealt by the sunder is repaired.
