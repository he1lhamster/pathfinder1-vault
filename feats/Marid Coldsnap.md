# Marid Coldsnap (Combat)

You can _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ a torrent of water to blast your enemies, chilling them to the bone.

**Prerequisites:** Con 15, Wis 17, _[[feats/Elemental Fist|Elemental Fist]]_**, _[[feats/Marid Spirit|Marid Spirit]]_, _[[feats/Marid Style|Marid Style]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +13 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 11th.

**Benefit:** While using _Marid Style_, as a standard action, you can spend two _Elemental Fist_ (Advanced Player's Guide 158) attempts to unleash a 30-foot line of frigid water. Creatures caught in the line take your unarmed strike damage plus the cold damage from your _Elemental Fist_ attack and are _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_ in ice as per the _Marid Spirit_ feat. A successful Ref lex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from becoming _entangled_.
