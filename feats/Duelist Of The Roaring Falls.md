# Duelist Of The Roaring Falls (Combat)

You have embraced the Roaring Falls method of Aldori swordplay, known for its elegant, sweeping strikes.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Aldori _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Dueling|Dueling]]_ Disciple|Aldori _Dueling_ Disciple]]_, _[[feats/Exotic Weapon Proficiency|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]]_ (_[[items/Weapon/Aldori _dueling_ sword|Aldori _dueling_ sword]]_), _[[feats/Weapon Finesse|Weapon Finesse]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_Aldori _dueling_ sword_), base attack bonus +5.

**Benefit:** When you use an _Aldori _dueling_ sword_ to deal damage to a _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_, _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_, or _[[conditions/Panicked|panicked]]_ foe, you can add your Dexterity bonus to damage rolls instead of your Strength bonus. If you can already add your Dexterity bonus to damage rolls, you instead gain a +1 competence bonus on damage rolls made with an _Aldori _dueling_ sword_. When you attempt a _dueling_ parry during a duel, the penalty on your attack roll to parry is reduced from -5 to -3. To gain these benefits, you must be wielding only an _Aldori _dueling_ sword_ (not using a _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_, an off-hand weapon, armor spikes, unarmed strikes, or natural weapons).
