# Upsetting Strike (Combat)

You can turn the tables on disoriented opponents.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15, _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_, _[[feats/Improved _[[spells/Shield|Shield]]_ Bash|Improved _Shield_ Bash]]_, _[[feats/Upsetting _Shield_ Style|Upsetting _Shield_ Style]]_, proficiency with bucklers.

**Benefit:** While you are using _Upsetting _Shield_ Style_, if a foe is taking a penalty on attack rolls against you as a result of _Upsetting _Shield_ Style_, and that foe makes a melee attack roll against you that misses your AC by 5 or more, that foe provokes an attack of opportunity from you. You can only make one attack of opportunity against an opponent in this manner each round.
