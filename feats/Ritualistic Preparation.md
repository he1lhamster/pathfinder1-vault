# Ritualistic Preparation

You have learned to access preparation rituals from spellbooks from which you can't otherwise benefit.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank, Linguistics 1 rank, Spellcraft 1 rank, ability to cast _[[spells/Read Magic|read magic]]_.

**Benefit:** You can treat spellbooks with preparation rituals as if they were _[[spells/Prayer|prayer]]_ books or meditation books.

**Special:** A character with this feat can take the _[[feats/Avid _[[items/Mundane/Spellbook|Spellbook]]_ Reader|Avid _Spellbook_ Reader]]_ feat even if she does not meet its prerequisites. Doing so allows her to benefit from the preparation rituals from two spellbooks, though she must still _[[spells/Sacrifice|sacrifice]]_ spell slots to benefit from preparation rituals when treating such books as meditation books.
