# Raging Regeneration (Combat)

Your _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ pushes your ability to _[[spells/Regenerate|regenerate]]_ beyond its normal limits.

**Prerequisites:** _Rage_ class ability, _[[universal monster rules/Regeneration|regeneration]]_, _[[monsters/Troll|troll]]_.

**Benefit:** While you are raging, fire and acid damage don't make your _regeneration_ stop functioning on the round following the attack, and instead reduce the number of hit points regained by _regeneration_ each round by 2 until the end of your next turn.

**Normal:** Acid and fire damage cause your _regeneration_ to stop functioning on the round following the attack.
