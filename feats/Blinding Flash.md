# Blinding Flash (Combat)

You can temporarily blind your opponent by using your weapon or _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ to flash sunlight into its eyes.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_.

**Benefit:** As a move action, you can expertly angle the blade of your weapon or _shield_ to reflect light into an opponent's eyes, dazzling your foe for 1 round. This feat functions as a _[[universal monster rules/Gaze|gaze]]_ attack, and the target must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Dex modifier) to resist the effect. This is a sight-dependent effect, and does not work on creatures that are already _[[conditions/Blinded|blinded]]_ or creatures that do not rely on sight as their primary sense. You must be wielding a weapon or _shield_ with a polished or reflective surface in order to use this feat. You must be in an area of bright light to use this feat.
