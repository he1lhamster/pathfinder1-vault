# Aberrant Tumor

To the surprise of others, that strange growth on you is actually your spellcasting companion.

**Prerequisites:** Aberrant bloodline.

**Benefit:** You gain a tumor familiar, as the tumor familiar _[[classes/Alchemist|alchemist]]_ discovery (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 17), with an effective _alchemist_ level equal to the level of the class that grants your aberrant bloodline for determining the tumor familiar's abilities. If multiple classes grant you the aberrant bloodline, those class levels stack for determining your effective _alchemist_ level.
