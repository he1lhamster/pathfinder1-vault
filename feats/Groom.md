# Groom

You _[[npcs/Recruit|recruit]]_ a professional _[[feats/Groom|groom]]_ to care for your _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Character level 4th.

**Benefit:** This feat is similar to the _[[feats/Leadership|Leadership]]_ feat, with several exceptions to note. You can attract only a 1st-level cohort (referred to hereafter as a _groom_) with this feat, and cannot _recruit_ followers of his own. You determine your _Leadership_ score according to the rules presented in the _Leadership_ feat (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 129), but your _groom_ is always at least 3 levels lower than your level. A _groom_ can take levels in _[[classes/Bard|bard]]_, _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_, or _[[classes/Ranger|ranger]]_. A _groom_ can't multiclass, though he can take any archetype for which he qualifies. A _groom_ finds the best place to _[[conditions/Stable|stable]]_ and conceal your _mount_ and the mounts of up to five allies while you and your allies are elsewhere. A _groom_ adds half his level (minimum 1) to Stealth checks when concealing himself and any mounts that are left in his care. A _groom_ also gains the ability to _[[spells/Speak with Animals|speak with animals]]_ as a supernatural ability, but he can use this ability only with horses, riding dogs, and other mounts of the animal type. If a _groom_ gains enough XP to bring him to 2 levels lower than your level, he doesn't gain the new level until you gain your next level; until you advance, his XP total remains 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level. If you release your _groom_ from service or otherwise lose your _groom_, you can _recruit_ a new one. At 7th level, you can swap this feat for the _Leadership_ feat.
