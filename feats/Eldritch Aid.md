# Eldritch Aid

You have been trained to _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ your own spell energy to boost the effects of an ally's spell.

**Prerequisites:** Caster level 1st.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can _expend_ a 1st-level or higher prepared spell or spell slot to grant additional magic energy to an _[[feats/Allied Spellcaster|allied spellcaster]]_ within close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels). If that ally casts an instantaneous spell of an equal or lower level before the beginning of your next turn, all level-dependent calculations and caster level checks the spell requires are made as if the ally's caster level were 2 higher. If the prepared spell or spell slot you expended is at least twice the level of the spell your ally casts, your ally's caster level is treated as 4 higher instead. If your ally is able to cast more than one spell before the beginning of your next turn, only the first spell cast gains this bonus.

**Special:** An _[[classes/Arcanist|arcanist]]_ can select this feat as an exploit. A _[[classes/Wizard|wizard]]_ can select this feat as a bonus feat.
