# Planar Infusion (Conduit)

After enduring hardship on another plane, your body, mind, and soul have become infused with that plane's power.

**Prerequisites:** You must spend a significant amount of time on a plane other than your home plane or the Material Plane. Typically, this amount of time should coincide with an adventure set on that plane, but at the GM's discretion, you can qualify for this feat in other ways, such as by being subjected to a powerful _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Planar|planar]]_ effect via the influence of an artifact associated with that plane, being exposed to raw energies from the plane, or even by _[[conditions/Dying|dying]]_ on another plane and being brought back to life in that reality.

**Benefit:** Your body, mind, or soul gains a benefit of some sort as a result of your infusion with the plane of your choice for which you meet the prerequisite. Details on _planar_ infusions can be found in each plane's Infusion section, as presented in Chapter 3 of this book. _Planar_ infusions that take actions to activate are supernatural abilities unless they specifically allow for the use of a spell, in which case they are _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_. Your caster level for _spell-like abilities_ granted by a _[[feats/Planar Infusion|planar infusion]]_ is equal to your Hit Dice (maximum CL 20th). All other _planar_ infusions are extraordinary abilities.

**Special:** You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you must select another plane for which you qualify. In cases where the specific effects of _Planar Infusion_ are identical, the effects do not stack.
