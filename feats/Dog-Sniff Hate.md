# Dog-Sniff Hate

Unlike many goblins, you're not particularly afraid of dogs. You know what dogs smell like, and that smell makes you mad-very mad.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Skill Focus|Skill Focus]]_ (Perception), _[[monsters/Goblin|goblin]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain the _[[universal monster rules/Scent|scent]]_ ability, but only against canines (including dogs, _goblin_ dogs, wolves, worgs, yeth hounds, and any similar creatures, subject to GM approval). Against these creatures, you gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and a +2 morale bonus on weapon damage rolls.
