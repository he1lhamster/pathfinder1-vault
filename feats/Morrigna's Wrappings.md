# Morrigna's Wrappings

One of the Boneyard's psychopomp bounty hunters has taught you the trick of using spider webs to defend against the undead.

**Prerequisites:** Character level 9th, _[[monsters/Duskwalker|duskwalker]]_, ward against corruption racial trait.

**Benefit:** So long as you have a spider web wrapped around some part of your body, the bonus provided by your ward against corruption racial trait increases to +4.
