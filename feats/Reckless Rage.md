# Reckless Rage

Your boundless _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ grants your blows extra strength, though at the expense of accuracy.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_; _rage_ or raging song class feature.

**Benefit:** When you use _Power Attack_ while raging or while using raging song, you take an additional -1 penalty on melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks, and you gain an additional +2 bonus on melee damage rolls. Modify this damage bonus appropriately based on the type of weapon you are using, as normal for _Power Attack_.
