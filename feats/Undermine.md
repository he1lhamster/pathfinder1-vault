# Undermine (Teamwork)

You and your allies take advantage of shifting terrain to unbalance enemies.

**Benefit:** When you use a combat maneuver to move a creature into or through a square adjacent to an ally with this feat, your opponent treats all squares adjacent to that ally as difficult terrain during his next turn. In addition, the DC of any of your opponent's Acrobatics checks in the affected squares increases by 2 for each of your allies with this feat who are adjacent to him.
