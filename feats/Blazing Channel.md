# Blazing Channel

Your holy power burns the undead like fire.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Turn Undead|Turn Undead]]_, channel positive energy class feature.

**Benefit:** When you use your _Turn Undead_ feat, undead failing their saving throw are engulfed in holy fire. This functions identically to catching on fire (Core Rulebook 444), but the damage dealt is divine (like the divine damage from _[[spells/Flame Strike|flame strike]]_) rather than fire. Water cannot extinguish this holy fire, but any negative energy effect that heals the creature of at least 5 points of damage extinguishes the flames instantly.
