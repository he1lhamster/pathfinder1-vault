# Ghostslayer (Combat)

Your blade is _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Keen|keen]]_ enough to hew _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ creatures.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +1, Knowledge (religion) 1 rank.

**Benefit:** As a swift action, you can imbue a weapon you wield with spiritual energies for 1 round. An imbued weapon damages _incorporeal_ creatures as though it were magical. If the imbued weapon has an enhancement bonus of +2 or greater, it functions as a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]]_ weapon. A weapon imbued in this way can deal precision damage (such as sneak attack damage) to _incorporeal_ creatures.
