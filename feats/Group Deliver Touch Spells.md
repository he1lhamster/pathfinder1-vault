# Group Deliver Touch Spells (Teamwork)

You and your teammates can deliver touch spells through each other's familiars.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Group Shared Spells|Group Shared Spells]]_, must have a familiar with the _[[feats/Share Spells|share spells]]_ and deliver touch spells abilities.

**Benefit:** You and any allies with this feat can cast spells through one another's familiars as though each ally had the _share spells_ ability with each other familiar. This feat otherwise functions as the _share spells_ ability.
