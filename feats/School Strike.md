# School Strike (Combat)

You focus the secrets of your school of wizardry into your unarmed strike.

**Prerequisites:** _[[classes/Wizard|Wizard]]_ school class feature, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_.

**Benefit:** When you gain this feat, choose one arcane school power that you can use to affect no more than one opponent. If you make a successful unarmed strike against an opponent, in addition to dealing your unarmed strike damage, you can use a swift action to deliver the effects of the chosen school power to that opponent. Doing so provokes no attacks of opportunity.

**Special:** You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you take it, you apply it to a different qualifying arcane school power.
