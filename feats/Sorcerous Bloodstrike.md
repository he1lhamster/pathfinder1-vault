# Sorcerous Bloodstrike

You can regain power when you kill a creature.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, _[[classes/Sorcerer|sorcerer]]_ bloodline class feature.

**Benefit:** Once per day, as an immediate action upon reducing a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with one of your _sorcerer_ spells, you can regain one usage of a _sorcerer_ bloodline power that has a limited number of uses per day. The slain creature must have at least half as many Hit Dice as your _sorcerer_ level. You cannot use this feat to gain another usage of a bloodline power that you have not yet used today.
