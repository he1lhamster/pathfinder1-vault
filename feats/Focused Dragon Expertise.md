# Focused Dragon Expertise (Combat)

Your understanding of dragons helps you to easily avoid breath weapons.

**Prerequisites:** Favored enemy (dragon) class feature.

**Benefit:** You gain a bonus on saving throws against breath weapons and _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effects equal to half your favored enemy (dragon) bonus. Whenever you succeed at a Reflex saving throw against a dragon's extraordinary or supernatural ability that would deal half damage, you instead take no damage. If you already have the evasion class feature, you instead gain an _[[classes/Inquisitor|inquisitor]]_'s _[[feats/Stalwart|stalwart]]_ ability (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 41) against dragons' extraordinary and supernatural abilities.
