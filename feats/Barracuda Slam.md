# Barracuda Slam (Combat)

You learn to ram the whole weight of your body into an opponent to take it by surprise.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 13, _[[feats/Barracuda Style|Barracuda Style]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, Acrobatics 5 ranks, Swim 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** With a successful Swim check, you can move half your speed as a move action or your full speed as a full-round action. You can run and charge _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_, though the maximum distance you can move while doing so is half the normal maximum distance. Further, while making a charge attack in water or on land, you can add twice your Strength bonus on the damage roll for your first unarmed strike on your turn.

**Normal:** You cannot charge or run _underwater_ unless you have a swim speed. With an unarmed strike, you usually add your Strength bonus on damage rolls.
