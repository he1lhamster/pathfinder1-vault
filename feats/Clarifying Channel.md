# Clarifying Channel

Your channeled energy heals the body and opens the mind to the possibility of _[[feats/True Love|true love]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Channel energy class feature, worshiper of Shelyn.

**Benefit:** Once per day when you channel positive energy to _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ living creatures, if any of the creatures you healed are currently affected by one or more charms or compulsions that allowed a saving throw, you grant each of those creatures an immediate save to prematurely end one of those effects. Creatures healed gain a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sacred|sacred]]_ bonus on this save equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum +1).
