# Toppling Spell (Metamagic)

Your spells with the force descriptor _[[spells/Knock|knock]]_ the affected creatures _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_.

**Benefit:** The _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Impact|impact]]_ of your force spell is strong enough to _knock_ the target _prone_. If the target takes damage, fails its saving throw, or is moved by your force spell, make a _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ check against the target, using your caster level plus your casting ability score bonus (Wisdom for clerics, Intelligence for wizards, and so on). This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the check fails, the target cannot attempt to _trip_ you or the force effect in response. A _[[feats/Toppling Spell|toppling spell]]_ only affects spells with the force descriptor. A _toppling spell_ uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
