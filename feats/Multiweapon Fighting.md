# Multiweapon Fighting (Combat)

This multi-armed creature is skilled at making attacks with multiple weapons.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, three or more hands.

**Benefit:** Penalties for fighting with multiple weapons are reduced by -2 with the primary hand and by -6 with off hands.

**Normal:** A creature without this feat takes a -6 penalty on attacks made with its primary hand and a -10 penalty on attacks made with all of its off hands. (It has one primary hand, and all the others are off hands.) See Two- Weapon Fighting in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook.

**Special:** This feat replaces the _[[feats/Two-Weapon Fighting|Two-Weapon Fighting]]_ feat for creatures with more than two arms.
