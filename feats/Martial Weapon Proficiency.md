# Martial Weapon Proficiency (Combat)

Choose a type of martial weapon. You understand how to use that type of martial weapon in combat.

**Benefit:** You make attack rolls with the selected weapon normally (without the non-proficient penalty).

**Normal:** When using a weapon with which you are not proficient, you take a -4 penalty on attack rolls.

**Special:** Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers are proficient with all martial weapons. They need not select this feat. You can gain _[[feats/Martial Weapon Proficiency|Martial Weapon Proficiency]]_ multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of weapon.
