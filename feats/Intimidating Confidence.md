# Intimidating Confidence

You have boundless faith in your success.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, _[[feats/Fearless Curiosity|Fearless Curiosity]]_, Intimidate 5 ranks, human.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on saving throws against effects with the emotion descriptor; this bonus stacks with the bonus granted by _Fearless Curiosity_. When you confirm a critical hit, as a free action you can make an Intimidate check to demoralize one creature you threaten. If you have the _[[feats/Dazzling Display|Dazzling Display]]_ feat, you can make Intimidate checks to demoralize all creatures you threaten instead. You gain a +2 bonus on this check if your weapon has a x3 critical modifier, or +4 if it has a x4 critical modifier.
