# Pesh Rejuvenation

When you are close to death, your body can convert _[[items/Mundane/Pesh|pesh]]_ into lifesaving medicine.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Sahir-Afiyun|Sahir-Afiyun]]_ or _pesh_ addict.

**Benefit:** If you are brought to 0 or fewer hit points while under the initial effect of _pesh_, you can end the drug's initial effect as an immediate action. If you do, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Constitution score. These temporary hit points last 1 hour. Upon using this feat, you are _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ for 1d6 hours.
