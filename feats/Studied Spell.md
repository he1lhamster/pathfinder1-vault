# Studied Spell (Metamagic)

You use your knowledge about the target to bypass its resistances and _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_.

**Benefit:** When casting a _[[feats/Studied Spell|studied spell]]_, designate one target affected by the spell. Attempt an appropriate Knowledge check based on that target's creature type as you cast the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the creature's CR based on its race and not including any class levels or template (a creature that is defined by class levels has an effective CR of 0 for this ability). If you succeed, your _studied spell_ ignores any _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Energy Resistance|energy resistance]]_ or _damage reduction_ the target has because of its race as well as any bonuses on saving throws against the spell granted by the target's race (such as the bonus from a dwarf 's hardy ability or a halfling's halfling luck ability). Your _studied spell_ doesn't ignore _energy resistance_, _damage reduction_, or saving throw bonuses granted by other spells and effects. If you fail the Knowledge check, the spell still has its normal effects. A _studied spell_ uses up a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell's actual level.
