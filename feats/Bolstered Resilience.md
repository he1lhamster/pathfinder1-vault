# Bolstered Resilience

You can dramatically increase your _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_ in exchange for its temporary loss.

**Prerequisites:** _Damage reduction_.

**Benefit:** As an immediate action, you can double your DR against a single attack, to a maximum of DR 20. The type of the DR remains unchanged. If the attack you are _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Guarding|guarding]]_ against is not successful, the increased _damage reduction_ persists until you are hit with an attack or until the start of your next turn, whichever happens first. At the start of your next turn, you become _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_. You cannot use this feat while you are _fatigued_.
