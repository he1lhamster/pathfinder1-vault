# Tengu Raven Form

You can shift into the form of a giant black raven.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Tengu Wings|Tengu Wings]]_, character level 7th, _[[monsters/Tengu|tengu]]_.

**Benefit:** Once per day, you can take the form of a Large black bird resembling a raven, granting you a fly speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability), a +4 size bonus to your Strength, a -2 penalty to your Dexterity, and a +4 natural armor bonus. This spell-like ability otherwise functions as _[[spells/Beast Shape II|beast shape II]]_ with a caster level equal to your level.
