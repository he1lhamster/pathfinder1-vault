# Monkey Lunge (Combat)

You can quickly recover from your lunges, helping you to avoid counterattacks.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Lunge|Lunge]]_, Acrobatics 1 rank.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can use the _Lunge_ feat to increase the reach of your melee attacks by 5 feet until the end of your turn, without suffering a penalty to your AC. You cannot use this feat if you carry a _[[classes/Medium|medium]]_ or heavy load.

**Normal:** You take a -2 penalty to your AC until your next turn when making a _lunge_ attack.
