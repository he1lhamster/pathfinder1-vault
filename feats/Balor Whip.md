# Balor Whip (Combat)

You can drag distant foes toward you with your _[[items/Weapon/Whip|whip]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ (_whip_), _Whip_ MasteryUC, base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit:** When you perform a dragAPG combat maneuver with your _whip_, you can choose not to move with your target, instead bringing your target closer to you. If you do this, you can't drag the target any farther than the distance it takes to move it adjacent to you, even if your result was high enough to drag the target farther. You gain a +2 bonus on drag combat maneuver checks when using a _whip_ to drag, but this bonus doesn't stack with the bonus from _[[feats/Improved Drag|Improved Drag]]_.

**Special:** _[[feats/Balor Whip|Balor Whip]]_ counts as Improved DragAPG for the purpose of qualifying for Quick DragUC.
