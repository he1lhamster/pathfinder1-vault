# Extra Blood Hex

Your ties to blood hexes are much stronger than those of most other practitioners.

**Prerequisites:** Int 15, two or more blood hex feats, Spellcraft 5 ranks, Use Magic Device 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** You can use blood hexes two additional times per day.

**Special:** You can take this feat more than once. Each time you do, you can use blood hexes two additional times per day. A character with this feat who takes levels in _[[classes/Shaman|shaman]]_ or _[[classes/Witch|witch]]_ can immediately replace this feat with any blood feat for which she meets the prerequisites.
