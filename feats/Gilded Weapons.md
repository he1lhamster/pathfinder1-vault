# Gilded Weapons

_[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Axiomatic|Axiomatic]]_ energies flow from the golden dust you shed, harming chaotic beings on contact.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Aphorite|Aphorite]]_, crystalline dust racial trait, nonchaotic alignment.

**Benefit:** As a swift action, you can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ 1 round of your crystalline dust ability to coat up to two of your natural weapons or held manufactured weapons in a layer of crystalline dust. The weapons remain coated for 1 round and deal an additional 1d6 points of damage to creatures with the chaotic subtype. This extra damage does not stack with other features that add alignment-based damage to weapons, such as the _axiomatic_ weapon special ability.
