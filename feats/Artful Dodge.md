# Artful Dodge (Combat)

You are practiced at avoiding attacks when outnumbered.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13.

**Benefit:** If you are the only character threatening an opponent, you gain a +1 _[[feats/Dodge|dodge]]_ bonus to AC against that opponent.

**Special:** The _[[feats/Artful Dodge|Artful Dodge]]_ feat acts as the _Dodge_ feat for the purpose of satisfying prerequisites that require _Dodge_. You can use Intelligence, rather than Dexterity, for feats with a minimum Dexterity prerequisite.
