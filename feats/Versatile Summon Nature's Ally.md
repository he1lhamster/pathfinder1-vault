# Versatile Summon Nature's Ally

You've learned to _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ a wider array of creatures.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Augment Summoning|Augment Summoning]]_, _[[feats/Spell Focus|Spell Focus]]_ (conjuration), Knowledge (nature) 1 rank, Knowledge (planes) 1 rank.

**Benefit:** When you _summon_ one or more animals, humanoids, or vermin using a _summon_ nature's ally spell (or an effect that mimics such a spell), instead of granting them the benefit from _Augment Summoning_, you can instead apply one of the following templates to them: aerial, aqueous, chthonic, fiery, or primordial. If you _summon_ multiple creatures with one casting, they must all have the same template.
