# Jawbreaker (Combat)

You deliver a powerful strike to the mouth, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Breaking|breaking]]_ teeth and bone.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Stunning Fist|Stunning Fist]]_, _[[spells/Heal|Heal]]_ 6 ranks.

**Benefit:** When you make a successful _Stunning Fist_ attempt against an opponent that is _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_, _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_, or _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_, instead of imparting any other _Stunning Fist_ effect, you can cripple that opponent's mouth, dealing normal unarmed strike damage and 1d4 points of _[[universal monster rules/Bleed|bleed]]_ damage. Until the _bleed_ damage ends, the target is unable to use its mouth to attack, speak clearly, and employ verbal spell components. A creature that is immune to critical hits or that has no discernible mouth is immune to the effects of this feat.
