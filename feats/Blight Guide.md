# Blight Guide

Your confidence in exploring dangerous regions inspires the same in your companions.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Blight Survivalist|Blight Survivalist]]_, _[[feats/Skill Focus|Skill Focus]]_ (Survival).

**Benefit:** Your bonus on saving throws gained from the _Blight Survivalist_ feat extends to your allies within 30 feet. Furthermore, once per day, if you would fail a saving throw against an environmental hazard or weather effect, you can reroll that save, but you must use the second result, even if it is lower.
