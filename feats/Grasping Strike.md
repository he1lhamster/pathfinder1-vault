# Grasping Strike (Combat)

The surrounding foliage lurches forth at your enemies in concert with your strikes.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Nature Magic|Nature Magic]]_ or the ability to cast _[[classes/Druid|druid]]_ or _[[classes/Ranger|ranger]]_ spells; _[[feats/Vital Strike|Vital Strike]]_, Knowledge (nature) 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** When you use _Vital Strike_ (or _[[feats/Improved Vital Strike|Improved Vital Strike]]_ or _[[feats/Greater Vital Strike|Greater Vital Strike]]_), you cause the foliage in the area to reach out and _[[spells/Entangle|entangle]]_ your foe (as the condition) if it fails a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier). The effect lasts for 1 minute or until the enemy breaks free with a successful Strength check or an Escape Artist check (DC = the effect's saving throw DC), whichever comes first. You can use this benefit a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). You can choose to use this ability as a free action after you hit the enemy with the attack. This is a supernatural ability.
