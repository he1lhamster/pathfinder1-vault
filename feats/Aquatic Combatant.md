# Aquatic Combatant (Combat)

You have trained to fight in the water.

**Prerequisites:** Swim 1 rank.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on Swim checks and don't take penalties on melee attack rolls made _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_. Your slashing melee attacks and unarmed bludgeoning attacks deal full damage _underwater_.

**Normal:** When _underwater_, most melee attacks take a -2 penalty and deal only half damage.
