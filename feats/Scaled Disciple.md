# Scaled Disciple

Your _[[feats/Draconic Heritage|draconic heritage]]_ manifests as _[[spells/Divine Power|divine power]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to spontaneously cast divine spells, _[[monsters/Kobold|kobold]]_.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus to your caster level when casting spells included in the dragon domain or subdomains. Your spontaneous divine spellcasting qualifies in place of arcane casting for the dragon disciple prestige class, and you may increase spellcasting in your spontaneous divine class as you progress in dragon disciple levels. Add the bonus spells gained from the blood of dragons ability to those you can cast as divine spells.
