# Spell Trick (Trick)

You are able to weave _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ contingencies into your target's mind.

**Prerequisites:** Masterful tricks class feature, ability to cast 4th-level _[[classes/Mesmerist|mesmerist]]_ spells.

**Benefit:** You can implant a _[[feats/Spell Trick|spell trick]]_ in a target's mind, following the same rules and limitations for implanting _mesmerist_ tricks. A _spell trick_ acts as a _mesmerist_ trick in all ways, except you specify under what circumstances the _spell trick_ can be triggered (known as the triggering condition) and what the trick's effects are once it is triggered. When determining the _spell trick_'s effects, choose one _mesmerist_ spell that you know. The _spell trick_ duplicates the effects of the chosen spell when triggered, as if you had cast the spell using a _mesmerist_ spell slot. When you are implanting a _spell trick_, you must _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ a _mesmerist_ spell slot of a level equal to or higher than the chosen spell's level. This spell can be countered and dispelled, and implanting it doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. You are considered the spell's caster for all purposes, and the spell uses your caster level and ability score modifiers for all purposes. You can't choose a spell with a range of personal unless you are implanting the trick in yourself or a target that you can share your spells with (such as via the _[[feats/Share Spells|share spells]]_ ability). A _spell trick_ counts as a _[[spells/Contingency|contingency]]_ spell when determining the total number of contingencies that a creature can have active at once.
