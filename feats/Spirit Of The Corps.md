# Spirit Of The Corps (Combat, Teamwork)

You find inspiration in your fellow soldiers, trusting that your shared _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ and dedication will bring you victory on the battlefield.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are within 10 feet of an ally benefiting from a spell or effect that grants a morale bonus on a particular type of roll, once during that effect's duration, you can apply that morale bonus on a roll you make of that type. For instance, if an ally with this feat is benefiting from _[[spells/Heroism|heroism]]_, once during the duration of the spell you could gain a +2 morale bonus on one saving throw, attack roll, or skill check. You can use this feat only once per round, and only once per spell or effect.
