# Improved Counterspell

You are skilled at _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Countering|countering]]_ the spells of others using similar spells.

**Benefit:** When counterspelling, you may use a spell of the same school that is one or more spell levels higher than the target spell.

**Normal:** Without this feat, you may counter a spell only with the same spell or with a spell specifically designated as _countering_ the target spell.
