# Ambush Awareness (Combat)

You are always on your toes and rarely caught off _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Awareness.

**Benefit:** If you are unable to act in a surprise round because of failing a Perception check, you still roll initiative normally. You can act on your initiative count in the surprise round, but you can take only the total defense action.
