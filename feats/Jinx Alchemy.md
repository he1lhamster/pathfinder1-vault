# Jinx Alchemy

With your knowledge of alchemy, creatures you jinx cannot benefit from most sorts of alchemical compounds.

**Prerequisites:** Swift alchemy class feature, Halfling Jinx trait.

**Benefit:** A jinxed creature cannot benefit from the effects of potions, elixirs, or any other substance that he must ingest in order to activate. This includes alchemical substances such as _[[items/Mundane/Antitoxin|antitoxin]]_, but not extracts, mutagens, or other _[[classes/Alchemist|alchemist]]_ class abilities that only affect the _alchemist_. A jinxed creature still takes any penalties and detrimental effects from ingested compounds or poisons.
