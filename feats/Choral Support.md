# Choral Support (Teamwork)

Raising your voice together with your allies', you wield sound itself as a weapon.

**Prerequisites:** Perform (sing) 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can attempt a DC 10 Perform (sing) check to aid an ally who also has this feat. If you succeed at the check, spells cast by your ally before the start of your next turn that deal acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage instead deal sonic damage. Spells that would normally deal sonic damage deal half sonic damage and half damage resulting directly from _[[spells/Divine Power|divine power]]_ that is not subject to being reduced by _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ to sonic attacks.
