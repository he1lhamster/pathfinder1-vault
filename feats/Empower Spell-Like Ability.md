# Empower Spell-Like Ability (Monster)

One of this creature's _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ is particularly _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ and powerful.

**Prerequisites:** Spell-like ability at caster level 6th or higher.

**Benefit:** Choose one of the creature's _spell-like abilities_, subject to the restrictions below. The creature can use that ability as an empowered spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). When a creature uses an empowered spell-like ability, all variable, numeric effects of the spell-like ability are increased by half (+50%). Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected. _Spell-like abilities_ without random variables are not affected. The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 its caster level (round down) - 2. For a summary, see the table in the description of the _[[feats/Quicken Spell-Like Ability|Quicken Spell-Like Ability]]_ feat on page 316.

**Special:** This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different spell-like ability.
