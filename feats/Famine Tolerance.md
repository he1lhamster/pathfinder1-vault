# Famine Tolerance

You can abide much longer periods without feeding, and enjoy increased benefits from a meal.

**Prerequisites:** Moroi or nosferatu.

**Benefit:** You can go without feeding for a number of days equal to twice your Hit Dice before having to make hunger saves. When you use your _[[universal monster rules/Blood Drain|blood drain]]_ ability, you gain twice the normal amount of temporary hit points for each feeding.

**Special:** This feat is only for campaigns using the optional undead hunger rules (see page 22).
