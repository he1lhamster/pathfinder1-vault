# Demonic Style (Combat, Style)

Self-preservation is irrelevant in the face of your fury.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** While using this style, when you use the charge action, the bonus on your attack roll increases by 1 and you deal 2 additional points of damage with melee attacks made as part of the charge.

**Special:** If you have the _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ or bloodrage class feature, you can enter _[[feats/Demonic Style|Demonic Style]]_'s stance as part of the free action to enter a _rage_. If you do, the style stance ends when your _rage_ ends.
