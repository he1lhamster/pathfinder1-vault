# Orator

You're able to construct statements and commands that are much more convincing than their content would otherwise suggest.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Skill Focus|Skill Focus]]_ (Linguistics).

**Benefit:** You can use a Linguistics check in place of a Bluff check to tell a falsehood or conceal information, in place of a Diplomacy check to change the attitude of a creature, or in place of an Intimidate check to force a creature to cooperate. You must deliver your attempt in a language the target understands.
