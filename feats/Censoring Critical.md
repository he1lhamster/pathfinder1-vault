# Censoring Critical (Combat, Critical)

Your critical hits mute your enemies.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Critical Focus|Critical Focus]]_, base attack bonus +15.

**Benefit:** Whenever you score a critical hit against an opponent, the victim is unable to speak for 1d4+1 rounds. This prevents spellcasters from using spells with verbal components. A successful Fortitude saving throw reduces this muteness to 1 round. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus.

**Special:** You can apply the effects of only one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you have _[[feats/Critical Mastery|Critical Mastery]]_.
