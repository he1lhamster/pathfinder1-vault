# Calm Disposition

You always appear to be in control of your situation.

**Prerequisites:** Prophets of Kalistrade 10 TPA.

**Benefit:** You gain +2 bonus on saving throws against effects that affect your composure. This includes all mindaffecting spells, as well as any spell or ability that would cause you to behave in an out-of-control manner, such as _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effects and nausea. This does not include physical effects such as fatigue, and does not reduce any damage taken from concurrent effects.
