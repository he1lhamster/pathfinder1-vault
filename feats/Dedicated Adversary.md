# Dedicated Adversary (Combat)

Your repeated encounters with a particular type of enemy have honed your skills against that foe.

**Prerequisites:** No levels in a class that has the favored enemy class feature.

**Benefit:** When you select this feat, choose a specific kind of creature, such as _[[monsters/Wolf|wolf]]_, frost giant, _[[monsters/Goblin|goblin]]_, or babau demon. You gain the _[[classes/Ranger|ranger]]_'s favored enemy class ability against this particular type of creature with a bonus of +2. This feat does not grant the favored enemy class feature for the purposes of prerequisites. If you later gain the favored enemy class feature, you can replace this feat with a feat for which you qualify and whose prerequisites include the favored enemy class feature.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a different creature.
