# Archon Justice (Combat)

Attacking you during your period of vigilance opens foes up to allies' strikes.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Archon Diversion|Archon Diversion]]_*; _[[feats/Archon Style|Archon Style]]_*; _[[feats/Combat Expertise|Combat Expertise]]_; _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_; base attack bonus +8 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 7th.

**Benefit:** You no longer take a penalty to AC for using _Archon Style_ to grant nearby allies a bonus to AC, and you can activate this effect as a swift action or a move action. Whenever you take damage from an attack you diverted to yourself using _Archon Diversion_, each ally threatening the attacking creature can make an attack of opportunity against that creature.
