# Vile Leadership

You rule over your own cabal of minions with a villainous cohort as your lieutenant.

**Prerequisites:** Any evil alignment, character level 7th.

**Benefit:** You can attract a loyal cohort and a number of intimidated followers to assist in your nefarious deeds. This feat is similar to _[[feats/Leadership|Leadership]]_, except _[[feats/Vile Leadership|Vile Leadership]]_ rewards-rather than punishes-leaders with _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_ reputations or who cause their followers' deaths. Once you take this feat, you cannot take the _Leadership_ feat without retraining your feat selection (Ultimate Campaign 191). Numerous factors can affect your _Vile Leadership_ score (which acts as a _Leadership_ score for the purpose of feats and abilities that rely on a _Leadership_ score, other than _Leadership_ itself ); work in conjunction with your GM and use the tables below to adjust your _Vile Leadership_ score accordingly. The NPCs you attract must be of a nongood alignment. _Vile Leadership_ Modifiers: Your reputation (from the point of view of the cohort or follower you are trying to attract) raises or lowers your _Vile Leadership_ score.

<table><tbody><tr><th>Leader's Reputation</th><th>Modifier</th></tr><tr><td>Ruthless</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Rewards loyalty or success</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Possesses a special power</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Indecisive</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>Tolerant of failure</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>_[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Merciful|Merciful]]_</td><td>-2</td></tr></tbody></table>

Other modifiers may apply when you try to attract a cohort with this feat, as listed below.

<table><tbody><tr><th>Leader's Attributes</th><th>Modifier</th></tr><tr><td>Gained power by eliminating a superior</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Fails to punish or kill minions who make costly mistakes</td><td>-2*</td></tr><tr><td>_[[feats/Recruits|Recruits]]_ a cohort of a different alignment</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>* Cumulative per incident of compassion shown. This penalty is incurred even if you show mercy to avoid killing or punishing more than 20% of your minions during a given character level (see the footnote in the following table).</td></tr></tbody></table>

Followers have different priorities from cohorts. When you try to attract a follower, use the following modifiers.

<table><tbody><tr><th>Leader's Attributes</th><th>Modifier</th></tr><tr><td>Has a _[[feats/Stronghold|stronghold]]_, base of operations, guildhouse, etc.</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Has punished or killed minions to set an example or assert dominance</td><td>+1*</td></tr><tr><td>Has a tendency toward long periods of inactivity</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>Restricts minions from looting, pillaging, or pursing other spoils of war</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>* Cumulative to a maximum bonus of +1 per character level. If you punish or kill more than 20% of your minions during a given character level, this bonus becomes a penalty instead. When you gain a new level, any bonus or penalty from punishing or killing minions resets to 0.</td></tr></tbody></table>
