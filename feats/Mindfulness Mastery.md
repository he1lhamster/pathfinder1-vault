# Mindfulness Mastery (Meditation)

The act of meditation allows you to steel your mind against mental attacks.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 19, _[[feats/Meditation Master|Meditation Master]]_*, _[[feats/Mindful Meditation|Mindful Meditation]]_, character level 13th.

**Benefit:** For 24 hours after you meditate, whenever you fail your saving throw against a charm, compulsion, emotion, or _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effect, you can attempt a new saving throw again 1 round later at the same DC. You get only this one extra chance to succeed at your saving throw.
