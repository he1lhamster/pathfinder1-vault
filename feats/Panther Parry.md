# Panther Parry (Combat)

Your _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_ strikes impair your foe's ability to attack you when you move.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 15, _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Panther Claw|Panther Claw]]_, _[[feats/Panther Style|Panther Style]]_.

**Benefit:** While using _Panther Style_, your retaliatory unarmed strikes are resolved before the triggering attacks. If your retaliatory unarmed strike deals damage to an opponent, that opponent takes a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls with the triggering attack of opportunity.
