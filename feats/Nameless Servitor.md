# Nameless Servitor

The fact that you have given up your real name makes you resistant to certain types of magic.

**Prerequisites:** _[[npcs/Risen Guard|Risen Guard]]_ rank, _Risen Guard_ 10 TPA.

**Benefit:** Anyone who attempts to use magic in order to learn personal information about you, such as through _[[spells/Divination|divination]]_, _[[spells/Scrying|scrying]]_, or similar magic, must make a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 plus your level to succeed. You are immune to spells that require the use of your name in order to function (such as _[[spells/Trap the Soul|trap the soul]]_). Most members of the _Risen Guard_ with this feat are addressed by their rank.

**Special:** If you ever choose a real name, you lose all benefits of this feat.
