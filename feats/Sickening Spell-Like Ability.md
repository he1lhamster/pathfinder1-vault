# Sickening Spell-Like Ability (Monster)

Your spell-like ability sickens affected targets.

**Prerequisites:** Spell-like ability at caster level 6th or higher.

**Benefit:** Choose one of your _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a _[[feats/Sickening Spell-Like Ability|sickening spell-like ability]]_ three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). When you use a _sickening spell-like ability_, a target that takes damage from the spell-like ability becomes _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ for a number of rounds equal to the spell-like ability's equivalent spell level. If the spell-like ability allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the sickening effect. If the spell does not allow a saving throw, the target can attempt a Fortitude save (against the DC that the spell-like ability would have if it allowed a saving throw) to negate the sickening effect. If the effect of the spell-like ability also causes targets to become _sickened_ and targets fail their save, add the duration of the _sickened_ condition caused by this effect to the duration of the _sickened_ condition imposed by the spell-like ability. _Spell-like abilities_ that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat. You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 2. For a summary, see Table 3-1.

**Special:** This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.
