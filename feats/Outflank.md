You look for every edge when flanking an enemy.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit:** Whenever you and an ally who also has this feat are flanking the same creature, your flanking bonus on attack rolls increases to +4. In addition, whenever you score a critical hit against the flanked creature, it provokes an attack of opportunity from your ally.
