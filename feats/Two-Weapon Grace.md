# Two-Weapon Grace (Combat)

You can fight using agility instead of brute strength, even while fighting with two weapons.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15; Fencing GraceUI, Slashing GraceACG, or Starry GraceUI; _[[feats/Two-Weapon Fighting|Two-Weapon Fighting]]_; _[[feats/Weapon Finesse|Weapon Finesse]]_.

**Benefit:** You can gain the benefit of the Fencing GraceUI, Slashing GraceACG, or Starry GraceUI feats while fighting with two weapons. Your penalties from _two-weapon fighting_ increase by 2 on all attack rolls you make when doing so, and you can't decrease the penalties to less than -2 even if other abilities would reduce the penalties further. Add 1/2 your Dexterity bonus to damage with your off-hand weapon instead of 1/2 your Strength modifier. If you attack without using your off-hand weapon, you can use the aforementioned feats despite your other hand being occupied. In addition, _[[feats/Two-Weapon Grace|Two-Weapon Grace]]_ counts as _[[feats/Double Slice|Double Slice]]_ for the purposes of qualifying for the _[[feats/Two-Weapon Rend|Two-Weapon Rend]]_ feat.

**Normal:** You gain no benefit from the listed feats if you don't have a free hand.
