# Blessed Hammer

Your god's power radiates from your _[[items/Weapon/Warhammer|warhammer]]_.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to cast 3rd-level divine spells, proficient with _warhammer_, worshiper of Torag.

**Benefit:** You can use any _warhammer_ you wield as a holy symbol when casting spells that require a divine focus or when you channel energy. Furthermore, as a swift action when you cast a divine touch spell, you can choose to have the _warhammer_ carry the charge of the spell instead of your hand. When you deliver a touch spell with your _warhammer_ you can do so as part of melee attack made with the _warhammer_. If you drop the _warhammer_ or the _warhammer_ is disarmed while carrying a charge, the charge is lost.
