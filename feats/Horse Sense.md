# Horse Sense

You take Grand Prince Beldam I's insistence upon the resilience of simple creatures to heart, emulating them to _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ yourself from complex mental effects.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 15, _[[feats/Iron Will|Iron Will]]_.

**Benefit:** When you attempt a saving throw against an enchantment effect that cannot affect an animal (such as _[[spells/Charm Person|charm person]]_), you can roll the saving throw twice and take the better result.
