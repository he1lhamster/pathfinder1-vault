# Linnorm Vengeance (Combat)

Your rigorous _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ allows you to redirect some of the energy from blows you take, turning your enemies' strength against them. Even death can't stop you from having your revenge.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 13, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, _[[feats/Linnorm Style|Linnorm Style]]_, base attack bonus +6 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 6th.

**Benefit:** While you're using the _Linnorm Style_ feat and an enemy hits you with a melee attack, you gain a +2 bonus on unarmed strike attack rolls you make against that creature until the beginning of that creature's next turn. If a creature's melee attack would normally miss you, you can allow it to hit you to gain this bonus; the attack deals the minimum amount of damage (as though the attacker had rolled a natural 1 on each damage die). Furthermore, if a melee attack deals enough damage to _[[spells/Knock|knock]]_ you _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_ or kill you, you can make a single retaliatory unarmed strike attack against that opponent as a free action before you drop _unconscious_ or die. If you do so, when you are restored to consciousness or to life, you are _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_ for 1 round.
