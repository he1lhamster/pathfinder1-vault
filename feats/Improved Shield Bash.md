# Improved Shield Bash (Combat)

You can protect yourself with your _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_, even if you use it to attack.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Shield Proficiency|Shield Proficiency]]_.

**Benefit:** When you perform a _shield_ bash, you may still apply the _shield_'s _shield_ bonus to your AC.

**Normal:** Without this feat, a character that performs a _shield_ bash loses the _shield_'s _shield_ bonus to AC until his next turn (see Chapter 6).
