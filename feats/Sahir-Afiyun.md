# Sahir-Afiyun

You have intertwined your familiarities with _[[items/Mundane/Pesh|pesh]]_ and magic to unlock strange powers.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Spell Focus|Spell Focus]]_ (any), ability to cast 2nd-level spells.

**Benefit:** When you consume _pesh_, you take 1 fewer point of Constitution or Wisdom damage (your choice). In addition, you add spells from the _[[feats/Sahir-Afiyun|sahir-afiyun]]_ spells listed below to your own class spell list or list of spells known. You can add one spell from the highest level you can cast; you can instead add two spells to your list of spells known, but both of these spells must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell you can cast for that class. If you have more than one spellcasting class, choose one and add the _sahir-afiyun_ spell or spells listed below to that class's spell list or list of spells known. 
1st-alleviate addiction (see page 19), lesser _[[spells/Confusion|confusion]]_, _[[spells/Night Blindness|night blindness]]_ (see page 19), _[[spells/Pesh Vigor|pesh vigor]]_ (see page 19), ray of sickeningUM, _[[spells/Remove Fear|remove fear]]_, sleep.

4th-absorbing inhalationARG, _confusion_, _[[spells/Divination|divination]]_. 
5th-symbol of sleep. 
All _sahir-afiyun_ spells require 1 dose of _pesh_ as a material component, either replacing the existing material component, or as part of the material component if the existing component costs more.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, add one or more _sahir-afiyun_ spells to your spell list.
