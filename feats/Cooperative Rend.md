# Cooperative Rend (Combat, Teamwork)

You and an ally each sink a claw into your foe-then all you have to do is _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[universal monster rules/Rend|Rend]]_, _[[monsters/Troll|troll]]_.

**Benefit:** Whenever you and an ally who has this feat are both threatening the same creature, you must hit the target with at least one of your claw attacks to use your _rend_ ability.

**Normal:** You must hit with two of your claw attacks to use your _rend_ ability.
