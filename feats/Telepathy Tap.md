# Telepathy Tap

You are able to notice, intercept, and interpret telepathic communication around you.

**Prerequisites:** Sense Motive 10 ranks, ability to cast _[[spells/Detect Thoughts|detect thoughts]]_ or telepathyOA as a spell or spell-like ability or _[[universal monster rules/Telepathy|telepathy]]_ supernatural ability.

**Benefit:** When a creature within range of your _telepathy_ (or within 60 feet if you are using _detect thoughts_) uses _telepathy_ to communicate, including when that creature sends or receives a magical _[[spells/Message|message]]_ such as _[[spells/Dream|dream]]_ or _[[spells/Sending|sending]]_, you can notice the attempt with a successful DC 30 Sense Motive check. At this point, you can either use your _telepathy_ ability or spend a use or casting of _detect thoughts_ as an immediate action. If you do so, for every 5 points by which your check exceeds the DC, you glean one fragment of information about the communication, such as the identity of its source; its general nature; the emotional state of the sender or the recipient; or a specific person, place, or thing mentioned in the _message_. In addition, the creature must attempt a saving throw (with a DC equal to that of the spell if you spent a use of _detect thoughts_ or are using _telepathy_, or 10 + 1/2 your racial HD + your Charisma modifier if you are using a racial _telepathy_ ability). If the target fails its save, you can listen to both sides of the telepathic or magical communication as long as you continue to concentrate each round as a standard action.
