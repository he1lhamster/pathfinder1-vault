# Greater Spell Penetration

Your spells break through _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ much more easily than most.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Spell Penetration|Spell Penetration]]_.

**Benefit:** You get a +2 bonus on caster level checks (1d20 + caster level) made to overcome a creature's _spell resistance_. This bonus stacks with the one from _Spell Penetration_.
