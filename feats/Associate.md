# Associate

You are on good terms with a large organization, though not necessarily an official member.

**Prerequisites:** Maintain a positive relationship with an organization for at least 6 months or achieve a major accomplishment on behalf of an organization.

**Benefit:** Select a single organization with which you have a positive relationship. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks to influence members of that group or when making gather information checks about the organization. In any settlement that is the size of a small town or larger, you can spend 1d4 hours to attempt to track down a representative of your organization to gain a minor resource or service for free (such as information), a place to stay, or transportation. If you succeed at a Diplomacy check (DC = 20 + the gp cost of the service requested [minimum 1 gp]), you successfully call in a favor and gain that service for free; otherwise, you must pay the normal fee. You can attempt this check once per week.

**Special:** You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you select this feat, you _[[feats/Associate|associate]]_ yourself with an additional organization.
