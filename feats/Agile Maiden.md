# Agile Maiden (Combat)

The _[[monsters/Gray|Gray]]_ Maidens' signature armor hinders you less than others.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13; Dex 13; _[[feats/Endurance|Endurance]]_ or armor _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ class feature; proficiency with heavy armor.

**Benefit:** For the purpose of class features (such as a _[[classes/Ranger|ranger]]_'s combat style, a _[[classes/Barbarian|barbarian]]_'s fast movement, or a _[[classes/Magus|magus]]_'s spellcasting), you treat _[[items/Armor/Gray maiden plate|Gray Maiden plate]]_ as _[[classes/Medium|medium]]_ armor or heavy armor, whichever is more beneficial to a given ability. This does not affect the armor's statistics, and it is still considered heavy armor for all other purposes.
