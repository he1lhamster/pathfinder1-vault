# Vanth's Scythe

You've seen the reapers many times, and have learned something of their methods.

**Prerequisites:** Character level 9th, _[[monsters/Duskwalker|duskwalker]]_, _[[monsters/Ghost|ghost]]_ _[[classes/Hunter|hunter]]_ racial trait.

**Benefit:** When you use your _ghost_ _hunter_ racial trait to grant a _[[items/Weapon/Scythe|scythe]]_, _[[items/Weapon/Quarterstaff|quarterstaff]]_, _[[items/Weapon/Whip|whip]]_, or bow the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]]_ weapon special ability, you also grant the undead-bane weapon special ability. You also gain an additional daily use of _ghost_ _hunter_.
