# Resisting Grappler (Combat)

You are especially adept at fighting off the grabbing appendages of aberrations and other tentacled horrors.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13.

**Benefit:** When a creature hits you with a melee attack and attempts to use the _[[universal monster rules/Grab|grab]]_ ability, it provokes an attack of opportunity from you unless it has the _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_ feat. If you hit the opponent with your attack, treat the damage you deal as 5 higher when calculating the penalty on the attacker's combat maneuver check to grapple you.

**Normal:** Creatures using the _grab_ ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
