# Stone Soul

You're so attuned to the earth that your skin can harden to the thickness of stone.

**Prerequisites:** Stone giant.

**Benefit:** Your natural armor bonus increases by 1. Once per day, you can use _[[spells/Stoneskin|stoneskin]]_ (on yourself only) as a spell-like ability. Your caster level is equal to 1/2 your Hit Dice.

**Special:** You can take this feat up to three times. Each additional time you take this feat, the number of times you can use _stoneskin_ per day increases by one.
