# Bat Shape

Your powers of _[[spells/Transformation|transformation]]_ have been honed to the point where you can wholly become a bat.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, werebat-kin.

**Benefit:** You can take the form of a bat whose appearance is static and cannot be changed each time you assume this form. You gain a +10 racial bonus on Disguise checks to appear as a bat. Changing from werebat-kin to _[[feats/Bat Shape|bat shape]]_ is a standard action. This ability otherwise functions as _[[spells/Beast Shape II|beast shape II]]_, and your ability scores change accordingly. If you wear a bat pelt (see page 31), you may choose to adopt a form resembling the bat whose skin you wear instead of your normal bat form.
