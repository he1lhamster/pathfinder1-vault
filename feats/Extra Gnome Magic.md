# Extra Gnome Magic

The raw magic that flows through your gnome blood is stronger than normal.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, gnome.

**Benefit:** You gain an additional three uses per day of your gnome _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ (_[[spells/Dancing Lights|dancing lights]]_, _[[spells/Ghost Sound|ghost sound]]_, _[[spells/Prestidigitation|prestidigitation]]_). You can use these in any combination; for example, you can use _dancing lights_ four times in one day (taking all three additional uses for the same spell), or you can cast _ghost sound_ twice, _prestidigitation_ twice, _[[spells/Speak with Animals|speak with animals]]_ twice, and _dancing lights_ once. If you have a feat, trait, or other ability that changes your racial 0-level _spell-like abilities_ to other 0-level spells, this feat applies to them instead.
