# Shadowy Dash

In dim light, you resemble little more than a _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|shadow]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Wayang|Wayang]]_.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are in an area of dim light or _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_, you can move at full speed using Stealth without taking the normal -5 penalty for doing so.

**Normal:** When moving at more than half your speed and up to your normal speed, you take a -5 penalty on Stealth checks.
