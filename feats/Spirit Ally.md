# Spirit Ally

You have a close connection with a spiritual assistant capable of aiding you in small ways.

**Prerequisites:** Caster level 8th.

**Benefit:** You gain the assistance of an _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ shapeless spirit. This acts as a constant _[[spells/Unseen Servant|unseen servant]]_ spell, using your character level as your effective caster level. For every 4 character levels you have, the _[[feats/Spirit Ally|spirit ally]]_'s effective Strength score increases by 2 (to a maximum of 12 at 20th level). If the _spirit ally_ dissipates or is dispelled, it returns after 24 hours.
