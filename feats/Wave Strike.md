# Wave Strike (Combat)

You present a serene facade until you unsheathe your weapon and strike in one fluid motion.

**Prerequisites:** Weapon expertise class feature or _[[feats/Quick Draw|Quick Draw]]_, Bluff 1 rank.

**Benefit:** If on your first turn of combat you draw a melee weapon to attack an opponent within your reach, you can spend a swift action to make a Bluff check to feint against that opponent.
