# Spear Dancing Style (Combat, Style)

You can use polearms and spears as double weapons.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, _[[feats/Two-Weapon Fighting|Two-Weapon Fighting]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ with the chosen weapon.

**Benefit:** Choose one weapon from the polearm or _[[items/Weapon/Spear|spear]]_ _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_ weapon groups. While using this style, you grant the chosen weapon the double special weapon feature, using the weapon's normal statistics for its main-hand end and the statistics of a _[[items/Weapon/Light mace|light mace]]_ for its off-hand end. A weapon wielded in this way loses the brace and reach special weapon features.

**Special:** A character with the weapon _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ (polearms or spears) class feature can use _[[feats/Spear _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Dancing|Dancing]]_ Style|Spear _Dancing_ Style]]_ with any polearm or _spear_, respectively, in addition to the chosen weapon.
