# Supernal Feast

You sup on the blood of your ancestors to fuel your fury.

**Prerequisites:** Con 15, _[[monsters/Aasimar|aasimar]]_.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are adjacent to a good outsider that takes _[[universal monster rules/Bleed|bleed]]_ or _[[universal monster rules/Blood Drain|blood drain]]_ damage, you gain 1 temporary hit point as you bathe in the celestial being's gore. Furthermore, as a full-round action, you can feast on the _[[monsters/Fallen|fallen]]_ body of a good outsider that has been dead no longer than 24 hours. When you do, you regain 1 temporary hit point per Hit Die the outsider possessed at a rate of 1 hit point per minute. Temporary hit points gained from this feat last 1d4 hours.
