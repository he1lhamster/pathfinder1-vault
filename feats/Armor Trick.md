# Armor Trick (Combat)

Choose one _[[feats/Armor Trick|armor trick]]_ option (light, _[[classes/Medium|medium]]_, heavy, or _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_). You can perform armor tricks in combat when wearing the appropriate armor option.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** You can use any armor tricks related to the chosen armor option if you meet the trick's prerequisites and are proficient with any armor that you use as part of the trick.

**Special:** You can gain _Armor Trick_ multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new _armor trick_ option.
