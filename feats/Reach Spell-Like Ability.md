# Reach Spell-Like Ability (Monster)

You can use a spell-like ability at a greater range.

**Prerequisites:** Spell-like ability at caster level 4th or higher.

**Benefit:** Choose one of your _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a _[[feats/Reach Spell-Like Ability|reach spell-like ability]]_ three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). When you use a _reach spell-like ability_, it can alter a spell-like ability with a range of touch, close, or _[[classes/Medium|medium]]_ to increase its range to a higher range category, using the following order: touch, close, _medium_, and long. You can select a spell-like ability that duplicates a spell only if its level is less than or equal to 1/2 its caster level (round down) - 1 per increase in range category. For example, a spell-like ability with a range of touch can be increased to long range only if it duplicates a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 3. For a summary, see Table 3-3. Reach _spell-like abilities_ that normally require melee touch attacks instead require ranged touch attacks. _Spell-like abilities_ that do not have a range of touch, close, or _medium_ do not benefit from this feat.

**Special:** This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.
