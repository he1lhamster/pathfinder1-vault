# Tyrant's Rebuke (Conduit)

By decree of Asmodeus, Hell is a place antithetical to free will; wielding its power humbles foes and renders them vulnerable to your commands. Those who you target with a pointed _[[spells/Rebuke|rebuke]]_ feel as if the disdain of Hell itself has turned its attention to their acts.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (planes) 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack. A creature successfully hit by this touch attack must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) or be _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ until the end of your next turn. If you use _[[feats/Tyrant's Rebuke|Tyrant's Rebuke]]_ on a creature that is already _staggered_ by this effect and it fails its Will save, it takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage in addition to being _staggered_. You can use this feat once per day for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge (planes).
