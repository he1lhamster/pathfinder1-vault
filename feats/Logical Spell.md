# Logical Spell (Metamagic)

You can eschew emotional components by exercising logic.

**Benefit:** A _[[feats/Logical Spell|logical spell]]_ can be cast without emotion components. Spells that don't require emotion components are not affected. A _logical spell_ uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.
