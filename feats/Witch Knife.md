# Witch Knife

You empower your _[[classes/Witch|witch]]_ spells by incorporating the use of a special ceremonial knife during your castings.

**Prerequisites:** _Witch_ class.

**Benefit:** Each day, when you prepare your spells, you can select a masterwork or magical _[[items/Weapon/Dagger|dagger]]_, transforming it into a _[[feats/Witch Knife|witch knife]]_, which serves as an additional focus component for _witch_ patron spells. Add +1 to the DC of all your patron spells.
