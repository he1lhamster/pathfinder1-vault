# Improved Precise Shot (Combat)

Your ranged attacks ignore anything but total concealment and cover.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 19, _[[feats/Point-Blank Shot|Point-Blank Shot]]_, _[[feats/Precise Shot|Precise Shot]]_, base attack bonus +11.

**Benefit:** Your ranged attacks ignore the AC bonus granted to targets by anything less than total cover, and the miss chance granted to targets by anything less than total concealment. Total cover and total concealment provide their normal benefits against your ranged attacks.

**Normal:** See the normal rules on the effects of cover and concealment in Chapter 8.
