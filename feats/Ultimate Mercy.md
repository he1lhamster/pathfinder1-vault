By using lay on hands, you can bring the dead back to life.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 19, _[[feats/Greater Mercy|Greater Mercy]]_, lay on hands, mercy class feature.

**Benefit:** You can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ 10 uses of lay on hands to bring a single dead creature you touch back to life as a _[[spells/Raise Dead|raise dead]]_ spell with a caster level equal to your _[[classes/Paladin|paladin]]_ level. You must provide the material component for _raise dead_ or choose to accept 1 temporary negative level; this level automatically goes away after 24 hours, never becomes a permanent negative level, and cannot be overcome in any way except by waiting for the duration to expire.
