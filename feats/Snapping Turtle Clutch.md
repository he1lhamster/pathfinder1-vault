# Snapping Turtle Clutch (Combat)

Your unarmed style allows you to turn your opponent's attack into an opportunity.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Snapping _[[monsters/Turtle|Turtle]]_ Style|Snapping _Turtle_ Style]]_, _[[feats/Improved Grapple|Improved Grapple]]_, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +3 or _[[classes/Monk|monk]]_ level 3rd.

**Benefit:** While you are using the _Snapping _Turtle_ Style_ feat, the _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ bonus the style grants to your AC applies to your CMD and touch AC. Whenever an opponent misses you with a melee attack while you are using the _Snapping _Turtle_ Style_ feat, you can use an immediate action to attempt a grapple combat maneuver against that opponent, but with a -2 penalty.
