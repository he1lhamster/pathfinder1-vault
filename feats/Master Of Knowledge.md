# Master Of Knowledge

In times of need, you have the answers.

**Prerequisites:** Int 17, _[[feats/Skill Focus|Skill Focus]]_ (Knowledge [any]), worshiper of Irori.

**Benefit:** Choose a single Knowledge skill with which you have _Skill Focus_. Once per day, when you _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ to make a check with that Knowledge skill, you need not roll, and may treat the result as if you had rolled a natural 20 instead.
