# Major Spell Expertise

You can cast a single low-level spell as a spell-like ability.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Minor Spell Expertise|Minor Spell Expertise]]_, ability to cast 9th-level spells.

**Benefit:** Choose one spell that you know of 5th level or lower. You may cast that spell twice per day as a spelllike ability. The caster level for this spell-like ability is equal to your caster level in the class from whose spell list the spell is taken. The spell-like ability's save DC is Charisma-based. If the spell has an expensive focus or material component, it may not be chosen for this feat. You cannot apply metamagic feats to this spell.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new spell.
