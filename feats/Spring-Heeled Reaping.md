# Spring-Heeled Reaping (Combat)

Your armor's flexibility and your own _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ allow you to strike multiple times while moving.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 17, _[[feats/Dodge|Dodge]]_, _[[feats/Mobility|Mobility]]_, _[[feats/Shot on the Run|Shot on the Run]]_ or _[[feats/Spring Attack|Spring Attack]]_, _[[feats/Spring-Heeled Sprint|Spring-Heeled Sprint]]_, _[[feats/Spring-Heeled Style|Spring-Heeled Style]]_, base attack bonus +11, proficiency with light armor.

**Benefit:** While using _Spring-Heeled Style_, whenever you use _Shot on the Run_ or _Spring Attack_, you can attack two different creatures at any point in your movement. Each attack is made at your full attack bonus. Any creature that you attack in melee with this feat cannot make attacks of opportunity against you for that movement, as normal for _Spring Attack_.
