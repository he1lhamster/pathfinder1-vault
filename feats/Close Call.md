# Close Call

Your nimble fingers are able to catch small slips before they become big disasters.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Deft Hands|Deft Hands]]_.

**Benefit:** Once per day, you may reroll either a Disable Device or Sleight of Hand check. You must decide to use this ability after the first attempt but before the results are revealed by the GM. You must take the second roll, even if it's worse.
