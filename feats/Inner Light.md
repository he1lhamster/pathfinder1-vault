# Inner Light

Even when your innate powers over light fail you, you and your allies prove _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Vigilant|vigilant]]_ against dark forces, fighting until the end.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Aasimar|Aasimar]]_, _[[spells/Daylight|daylight]]_ spell-like ability.

**Benefit:** Whenever you cast your _daylight_ spell-like ability, you do so as if your caster level were one higher. Whenever an enemy successfully counters or dispels your _daylight_ spell-like ability, you and any allies within a 20-foot radius gain _[[spells/Darkvision|darkvision]]_ 60 feet for a number of rounds equal to your character level. This is a supernatural effect.
