# Onslaught (Combat)

No one is prepared for how hard you strike until they see it firsthand.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, base attack bonus +1, sneak attack class feature.

**Benefit:** If you use _Power Attack_ with the first melee attack you make during a surprise round, you can sneak attack even if you are not flanking your target and it's not denied its Dexterity bonus to AC.
