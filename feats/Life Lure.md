# Life Lure

Your channeled positive energy is irresistibly sweet to nearby undead.

**Prerequisites:** Channel positive energy class feature.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can channel positive energy to fascinate all undead within 30 feet for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). Undead that succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ level + your Charisma modifier) are unaffected. _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Channeling|Channeling]]_ energy for this purpose does not _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ or _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ creatures.
