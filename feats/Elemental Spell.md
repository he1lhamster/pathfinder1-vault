# Elemental Spell (Metamagic)

You can manipulate the elemental nature of your spells.

**Benefit:** Choose one energy type: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You may replace a spell's normal damage with that energy type or _[[universal monster rules/Split|split]]_ the spell's damage, so that half is of that energy type and half is of its normal type. An _[[feats/Elemental Spell|elemental spell]]_ uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you must choose a different energy type.
