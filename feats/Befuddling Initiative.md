# Befuddling Initiative (Combat)

Your quick reflexes leave your surprised opponents particularly disoriented.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Initiative|Improved Initiative]]_.

**Benefit:** You treat each opponent that begins a surprise round _[[conditions/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]_ as being _flat-footed_ until its action in the first full round of combat, even if it acts on the surprise round.
