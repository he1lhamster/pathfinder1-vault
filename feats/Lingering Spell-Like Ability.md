# Lingering Spell-Like Ability (Monster)

Your spell-like ability clings to existence, slowly fading from the world.

**Prerequisites:** Spell-like ability at caster level 4th or higher.

**Benefit:** Choose one of your _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a _[[feats/Lingering Spell-Like Ability|lingering spell-like ability]]_ three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). A _lingering spell-like ability_ causes an instantaneous spell-like ability that affects an area to persist until the beginning of its next turn. Targets already in the area suffer no additional _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_, but other creatures or objects entering the area are subject to its effects. A _lingering spell-like ability_ with a visual manifestation obscures _[[spells/Vision|vision]]_, providing concealment (20% miss chance) beyond 5 feet and total concealment (50% miss chance) beyond 20 feet. You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 1. For a summary, see Table 3-1.

**Special:** This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.
