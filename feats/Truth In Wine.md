# Truth In Wine

In refining your palate and experiencing the food, drink, and meal rituals of myriad cultures, you have learned to divine truths about human behavior and use intoxication to break down psychological barriers.

**Prerequisites:** Appraise 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** You can perform the psychometry occult skill unlockOA even if you can't use _[[universal monster rules/Psychic Magic|psychic magic]]_, though you must consume a drink of high-quality alcohol (costing at least 10 gp per drink) to do so. If you can cast _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ spells or have the _Psychic_ SensitivityOA feat, you can use psychometry one additional time per day. If you consume a drink of high-quality alcohol, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise and Sense Motive checks for 1 minute and can increase the caster level of the next _[[spells/Divination|divination]]_ spell you cast within 1 minute by 1. If you are addicted to alcohol, as described on page 236 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide, these bonuses increase by 1, but so too does the save DC for your addiction.
