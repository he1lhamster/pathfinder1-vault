# Greater Ironclad Reactions (Armor Mastery)

You are able to quickly react to attacks.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Combat Reflexes|Combat Reflexes]]_, _[[feats/Ironclad Reactions|Ironclad Reactions]]_, base attack bonus +11 or _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_ level 8th, armor _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ class feature, proficiency with _[[classes/Medium|medium]]_ armor.

**Benefit:** You can use _Ironclad Reactions_ more than once per round, but not more than once for each act you take that provokes an attack of opportunity. Each 5-foot step you take still counts as expending one use of an attack of opportunity.
