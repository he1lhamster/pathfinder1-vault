# Raging Brutality

You _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ some of your _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ to strike your opponents with a more powerful weapon blow.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, _rage_ class feature, _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_, base attack bonus +12.

**Benefit:** While raging and using _Power Attack_, you can spend 3 additional rounds of your _rage_ as a swift action to add your Constitution bonus on damage rolls for melee attacks or thrown weapon attacks you make on your turn. If you are using the weapon two-handed, instead add 1-1/2 times your Constitution bonus. This bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit.
