# Elemental Strike (Combat)

You draw upon your extraplanar heritage to imbue your weapons with elemental energies.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Ifrit|Ifrit]]_, _[[monsters/Oread|oread]]_, _[[monsters/Sylph|sylph]]_, or _[[monsters/Undine|undine]]_.

**Benefit:** As a swift action, you can imbue your weapons with elemental energy. For 1 round, your weapons deal an additional 1 point of energy damage. The type of energy damage depends on your race: acid for _oread_, electricity for _sylph_, fire for _ifrit_, or cold for _undine_. For every 5 levels you possess, this bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.

**Special:** You can use this feat instead of _[[feats/Arcane Strike|Arcane Strike]]_ to qualify for or attack with the _[[feats/Deadly Dealer|Deadly Dealer]]_ feat (Pathfinder Player Companion: The Harrow Handbook 15).
