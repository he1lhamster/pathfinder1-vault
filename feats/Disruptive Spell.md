# Disruptive Spell (Metamagic)

Your magical energies cling to enemies, interfering with their spellcasting.

**Benefit:** Targets affected by a _[[feats/Disruptive Spell|disruptive spell]]_ must make concentration checks when using spells or _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ (DC equals the save DC of the _disruptive spell_ plus the level of the spell being cast) for 1 round. Targets that avoid the spell's effects avoid this feat's effect as well. A _disruptive spell_ uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
