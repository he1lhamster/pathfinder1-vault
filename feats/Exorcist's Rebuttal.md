# Exorcist's Rebuttal

You've experienced the suffocating grip of _[[feats/Demonic Possession|demonic possession]]_. The event left you emotionally scarred, but it also tempered your mind against the prying magic of evil enchantments.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Improved Iron Will|Improved Iron Will]]_, _[[feats/Iron Will|Iron Will]]_.

**Benefit:** If you use your _Improved Iron Will_ feat to reroll a Will save against a compulsion effect and successfully save against the effect, the creature that created the effect (if it originated from a creature) takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage.
