# Resistance Mastery (Item Mastery)

You can protect yourself from _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ by using abjuration magic items.

**Prerequisites:** Use Magic Device 3 ranks, base Fortitude saving throw bonus +3.

**Benefit:** Once per day, you can meditate for 10 minutes in order to use magic armor or a wondrous item that has an abjuration spell of 2nd level or higher listed in its construction requirements and that occupies a slot on your body to gain a defensive benefit. This benefit can be either a +1 _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ bonus on all saving throws or 5 points of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Energy Resistance|energy resistance]]_ against one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). This benefit lasts for 24 hours. You must wear the item in order to gain this benefit; if the item is removed before this feat's benefit ends, the benefit is immediately lost and cannot be regained until 24 hours have passed since the feat's last activation. The _resistance_ bonus granted by this feat increases by 1 or the _energy resistance_ increases by 5 when your base Fortitude save bonus reaches +6, +9, and +12. You can gain only one benefit from this feat at a time.
