# Sly Draw

You can draw your weapon with such speed and finesse that your opponents don't realize they're threatened.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Quick Draw|Quick Draw]]_.

**Benefit:** When you draw a light weapon, you may make a Sleight of Hand check instead of a Bluff check to feint in combat. Other feats and abilities that affect a feint still apply to your feint.
