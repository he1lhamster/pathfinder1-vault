# Deadly Stroke (Combat)

With a well-placed strike, you can bring a swift and painful end to most foes.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Dazzling Display|Dazzling Display]]_, _[[feats/Greater Weapon Focus|Greater Weapon Focus]]_, _[[feats/Shatter Defenses|Shatter Defenses]]_, _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_, proficiency with the selected weapon, base attack bonus +11.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, make a single attack with the weapon for which you have _Greater Weapon Focus_ against a _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_ or _[[conditions/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]_ opponent. If you hit, you deal double the normal damage and the target takes 1 point of Constitution _[[universal monster rules/Bleed|bleed]]_ (see Appendix 2). The additional damage and _bleed_ is not multiplied on a critical hit.
