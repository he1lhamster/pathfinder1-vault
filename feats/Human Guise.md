# Human Guise

You have the ability to perfectly emulate a human.

**Prerequisites:** _[[universal monster rules/Change Shape|Change shape]]_ ability, shapechanger subtype, must be able to _change shape_ into a human or must have a _[[spells/True Form|true form]]_ that appears human.

**Benefit:** You count as both human and your race for the purpose of taking character options, such as archetypes, feats, spells, traits, and prestige classes. In addition, you count as human for all other effects whenever you would otherwise appear human. For instance, a +1 human _[[spells/Bane|bane]]_ arrow would deal additional damage to a _[[monsters/Kitsune|kitsune]]_ with this feat while she was in her human form (as per _change shape_), but not in her _true form_. Likewise, such an arrow would deal additional damage to a _[[monsters/Skinwalker|skinwalker]]_ with this feat while she was in her _true form_, but would not in her bestial form (as per _change shape_).
