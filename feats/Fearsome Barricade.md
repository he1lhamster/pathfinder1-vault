# Fearsome Barricade (Combat)

Your wrath is as _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ a barrier as your blades.

**Prerequisites:** Intimidate 5 ranks, Ulfen _[[npcs/Guard|Guard]]_ TPA 20.

**Benefit:** Choose an adjacent ally as a free action on your turn. Once per round, when an opponent attacks that ally, you may make an Intimidate check to demoralize the opponent as an immediate action. This action counts as an attack of opportunity.
