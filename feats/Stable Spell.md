# Stable Spell (Metamagic)

You can cast spells in areas of primal magic with less chance of triggering a primal magic event.

**Benefit:** In areas of primal magic, the chance of a _[[feats/Stable Spell|stable spell]]_ triggering a primal magic event is reduced by 25%. In cases where a primal magic event would trigger despite the reduced chances, the caster of a _stable spell_ receives a +2 bonus on the concentration check to avoid the primal magic event. A _stable spell_ uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.
