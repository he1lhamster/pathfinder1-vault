# Vestigial Head

You were born with a parasitic _[[feats/Vestigial Head|vestigial head]]_ with its own stunted brain. The head may be mostly subsumed within your own flesh and visible only as a distorted face, or it might sprout out of its own neck from your neck, shoulder, back, or chest.

**Prerequisites:** _[[monsters/Ogre|Ogre]]_.

**Benefit:** Anytime you must attempt a Will save against a hostile effect, there is a 25% change that the effect targets your _vestigial head_ instead. If this occurs, you are treated as if you had succeeded at your saving throw, and instead are _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ for 1d4 rounds or the duration of the effect (whichever is longer).

**Special:** You can take this feat twice. The second time you do, the chance of a hostile Will effect targeting your _vestigial head_ instead of your own increases to 50%. This doesn't give you another _vestigial head_.
