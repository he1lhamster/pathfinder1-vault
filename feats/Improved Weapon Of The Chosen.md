# Improved Weapon Of The Chosen (Combat)

You gain even greater favor when you use your deity's favored weapon.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Weapon Focus|Weapon Focus]]_ with your deity's favored weapon, _[[feats/Weapon Of The Chosen|Weapon of the Chosen]]_.

**Benefit:** This feat acts as _Weapon of the Chosen_, except you gain the benefits on all attacks until the start of your next turn. Your attacks gain a single alignment component of your deity-either chaotic, evil, good, or lawful-for the purpose of overcoming _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_. If your deity is neutral with no other alignment components, your attacks instead overcome _damage reduction_ as though your weapon were both cold iron and silver.
