# One Mind (Teamwork)

Your nearly supernatural mental connection with your allies keeps you in a constant state of readiness.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Alertness|Alertness]]_, Sense Motive 3 ranks, human (Vudrani).

**Benefit:** Whenever you're adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, if your ally is not _[[conditions/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]_, you're also not considered _flat-footed_ before you act in combat (you might become _flat-footed_ in other ways, however). Additionally, if your ally can see a creature that you can't see, that creature doesn't gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against you from being _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_, nor do you take a -2 penalty to AC for being _[[conditions/Blinded|blinded]]_ if your ally can see.
