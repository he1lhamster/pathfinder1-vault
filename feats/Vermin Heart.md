# Vermin Heart

You have a special bond with things that creep, crawl, skitter, and sting.

**Prerequisites:** Wild _[[feats/Empathy|empathy]]_ class feature.

**Benefit:** You may target vermin with spells and special abilities that only affect animals (although they are still affected by spells targeting vermin as well). You may use wild _empathy_ to inf luence vermin as easily as you inf luence animals.
