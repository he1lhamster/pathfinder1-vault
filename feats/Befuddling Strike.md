# Befuddling Strike (Combat)

You know just where to strike to temporarily send your enemy into a _[[conditions/Confused|confused]]_ stupor.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, Wis 13, _[[feats/Improved Unarmed Strike|Improved Unarmed Strike]]_, base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit:** _[[feats/Befuddling Strike|Befuddling Strike]]_ forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll-thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt. A defender who fails this saving throw is _confused_ for 1d4 rounds. You can attempt to use _Befuddling Strike_ once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but can use it no more than once per round. Constructs, _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ creatures, mindless creatures, plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected by this ability.
