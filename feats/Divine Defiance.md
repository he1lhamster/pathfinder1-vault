# Divine Defiance

You distrust, disrespect, or doubt the gods, which helps you fight off their power.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against divine spells and the _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ granted by levels in a divine casting class.

**Special:** In certain circumstances, some outsiders and creatures of other types might have a strong connection to a specific deity they work for as agents and servants. These creatures' spells and _spell-like abilities_ should likewise be affected by this feat, regardless of the creatures' _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Planar|planar]]_ origins or sources of magical power, subject to the GM's discretion.
