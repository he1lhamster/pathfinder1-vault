# Careful Sneak

By taking your time, you negate penalties while sneaking in most armor.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, Stealth 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** You do not apply the armor check penalty for light and _[[classes/Medium|medium]]_ armor on Stealth skill checks as long as you move half your speed or less. You still cannot run or charge while using Stealth in this way.
