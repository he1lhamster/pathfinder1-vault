# Exploit Lore

You can use your knowledge of a creature's weaknesses to deliver a driving and relentless assault against it.

**Prerequisites:** Monster lore class feature, base attack bonus +11.

**Benefit:** Once per day, when you successfully _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ all abilities and weaknesses of a creature using the appropriate Knowledge check, you gain a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls against that creature for 1 minute. If you _identify_ the abilities and weaknesses of numerous creatures, you must pick one creature to be the target of this effect.
