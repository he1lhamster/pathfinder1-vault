# Shifting Patterns

You can focus your concentration when maintaining pattern effects to slowly move them.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Spell Focus|Spell Focus]]_ (illusion), caster level 5th.

**Benefit:** When you are concentrating to maintain a spell from the pattern subschool, you can move any area effects associated with that spell by up to 10 feet as a move action. Creatures within the new area of effect are subject to the spell as if it had just been cast (attempting saves as normal). When concentrating on a pattern spell that already allows you to move the effect, such as _[[spells/Rainbow Pattern|rainbow pattern]]_, increase the distance you can move the pattern by 50%.
