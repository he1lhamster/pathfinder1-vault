# Improved Dirge Of Doom

The foreboding tone of your dirge is especially effective at unsettling your enemies.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to perform dirge of _[[spells/Doom|doom]]_.

**Benefit:** The range of your dirge of _doom_ ability is extended to 60 feet. Additionally, if a creature is _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ from another effect, the effect of your dirge of _doom_ is changed to _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_ for that specific creature. This benefit cannot cause a creature to become _[[conditions/Panicked|panicked]]_, even if a target is already _frightened_ from another effect. Once affected by this feat, a creature cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.

**Normal:** The range of dirge of _doom_ is 30 feet. A creature that is already _shaken_ cannot become _frightened_ by dirge of _doom_.
