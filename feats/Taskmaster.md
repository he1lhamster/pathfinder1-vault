# Taskmaster (Combat)

You intimidate weaker allies into reckless _[[universal monster rules/Ferocity|ferocity]]_.

**Prerequisites:** _[[feats/Demoralizing Lash|Demoralizing Lash]]_, Intimidate 5 ranks, _[[monsters/Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]]_.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you spur an ally, who must have fewer Hit Dice than yourself, to reckless effort. For 1 minute, the ally gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and Will saves against mind-affecting effects. However, the ally also takes a -2 penalty to AC and on skill checks. To affect an unwilling ally, you must succeed at an Intimidate check with the same DC used to demoralize your ally.

**Special:** If you have 10 or more ranks in Intimidate, the morale bonus increases to +2.
