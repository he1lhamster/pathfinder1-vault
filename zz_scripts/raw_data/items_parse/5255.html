Though <em>preyfinders</em> function as standard compasses (<em>Ultimate Equipment</em> 62), making them useful tools for navigation, they also have the power to magically identify and track down creatures.</p><p>To use a <em>preyfinder</em>, its bearer must (as a standard action) take a drop of blood from a creature, smear it onto the compass's glass faceplate, and then touch the compass to his head. The blood must be no more than 1 week old, and can come from a living or dead creature, though a living or undead target can attempt a DC 18 Will save to resist the <em>preyfinder's</em> tracking ability. If the Will save is successful, the <em>preyfinder</em> can't identify or locate the creature, and none of the <em>preyfinder's</em> magical powers function for 24 hours. If the creature fails the Will save, the <em>preyfinder</em> telepathically provides its bearer with an image of the creature to which the drop of blood belonged and marks the creature as the <em>preyfinder's</em> quarry.</p><p>After a creature is marked as the <em>preyfinder's</em> quarry, the bearer can spend a standard action to magically divine the creature's current location. As long as the quarry is no more than 100 miles away, the <em>preyfinder</em> provides a series of telepathic images to the bearer, who is then able to determine the direction toward and exact distance to the quarry. This detection ability can be fooled by <em>mislead</em>, <em>nondetection</em>, and <em>polymorph</em> spells and effects.</p><p>A <em>preyfinder</em> can have only one creature designated as its quarry at any one time. If the bearer adds a new drop of blood, the old quarry is replaced by the new one. The bearer can also spend a full-round action to remove a quarry designation from the <em>preyfinder</em>.</p><p>When used by a slayer with the studied target class feature, a <em>preyfinder</em> grants the slayer a +1 insight bonus on all attack and damage rolls made against a creature designated as the <em>preyfinder's</em> quarry. Additionally, instead of designating another creature as its quarry, a slayer can add a drop of his own blood to the <em>preyfinder</em> (a standard action) to gain a +2 morale bonus on all attack rolls, saves, and skill checks he attempts for 1 minute. After a slayer adds a drop of his own blood to the <em>preyfinder</em>, none of the <em>preyfinder's</em> magical powers functions for 24 hours.</p><h2>Crafting requirements</h2><p><strong>Crafting cost: </strong>42500 gp</p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>blood biography</em>, <em>heroism</em>, <em>locate creature</em><h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Advanced Class Guide</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
