When played, it can summon forth a soul bound to it. Initially, the soul is that of the person whose corpse was used to make the instrument. The spirit manifests in an adjacent square as a translucent, intangible image of the person as he was in life. The image cannot attack or be attacked in any way. It is clearly distressed by the musician's playing; it wails an eerie, pained accompaniment that nonetheless enhances the music's quality, granting a +4 circumstance bonus on Performance checks made with the instrument and (if the performer is a bard) adding 1 to the DC of a dirge of doom, frightening tune, or deadly performance played on the instrument.</p><p>If an undead is within 30 feet, the musician can command the bound soul to seize it as a standard action. The undead must attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it's successful, the image dissipates for 1 day; if it fails, the soul rides the undead for 1d4+1 rounds, acting as <em>control undead</em> cast by the musician. If the musician has the bardic performance ability, she can continue playing and spend a round of bardic performance as a free action each round to prevent that round from counting toward the duration of this effect. The soul dissipates for 1 day after the effect ends.</p><p>Crafting the instrument destroys the original body; that creature cannot be brought back to life via <em>raise dead</em>. As long as the instrument exists, <em>resurrection</em> and <em>true resurrection</em> can revive the creature only if they're cast on the instrument itself; doing so destroys the instrument. The instrument cannot be affected by spells that target corpses, such as <em>animate dead</em> or <em>decompose corpse</em>.</p><h2>Crafting requirements</h2><p><strong>Crafting cost: </strong>17000 gp</p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>control undead</em>, <em>ghost sound</em>, creator must be evil<h2>Tags</h2>Evil<h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Champions of Corruption</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
