The flaws in the drum's skin render the drum difficult to play, imposing a –4 penalty on the user's Profession (percussion) checks. Though undesirable as musical instruments, <em>gremlin-skin drums</em> are icons of ill luck and therefore prized by followers of Zyphus. These drums are usually planted in an area to encourage accidents or other misfortune there. As a standard action, the user can activate a <em>gremlin-skin drum</em> by setting it down and beating it three times. Once activated, the <em>gremlin-skin drum's</em> effect (see below) continually targets all creatures within 30 feet until the drum is picked up or moved, at which point the effect ends. A <em>gremlin-skin drum</em> can be activated up to five times before it becomes a nonmagical drum of poor craftsmanship.</p><p>Several types of <em>gremlin-skin drums</em> exist, and each drum's powers depend on the type of gremlin flesh used as its skin. These effects appear to be mere mischance upon casual observation; an observer must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to notice that whenever a creature suffers a <em>gremlin-skin drum's</em> effect, the skin of the drum shudders slightly. The effects of multiple versions of the same type of <em>gremlin-skin drums</em> don't stack.</p><p><em>Grimple-Skin Drum</em>: The diseased-looking skin of this drum occasionally oozes maggots. The penalties from the sickened condition increase by 1 (from –2 to –3) for any creatures within 30 feet of a <em>grimple-skin drum</em>.</p><p><em>Haniver-Skin Drum</em>: The skin of this drum is leathery and moist. Any creature within 30 feet of the drum that attempts to draw or sheathe a weapon must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save to avoid dropping the weapon.</p><p><em>Jinkin-Skin Drum</em>: The thin skin of this drum has cartilaginous striations throughout. Creatures within 30 feet of the drum take a –1 penalty on saving throws to avoid curses and pit traps.</p><p><em>Monaciello-Skin Drum</em>: The skin of this drum is red and warty. Creatures within 30 feet of the drum find their thinking muddled, and take a –5 penalty on all Knowledge checks.</p><p><em>Nuglub-Skin Drum</em>: The skin of this drum is dotted with tufts of long, oily hair. Any creature tripped within 30 feet of the drum takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from a painful fall.</p><p><em>Pugwampi-Skin Drum</em>: The skin of this drum has patches of mangy fur. Luck bonuses are reduced by 1 (minimum 0) for any creatures within 30 feet of the drum.</p><p><em>Vexgit-Skin Drum</em>: The skin of this drum has patches of rough scales. Creatures within 30 feet of the drum that fail to avoid a trap take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage in addition to the usual effects of the trap.</p><h2>Crafting requirements</h2><p><strong>Crafting cost: </strong>3000 gp</p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>bestow curse</em>, one dead gremlin of the type used to make the drum<h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Pathfinder #87: The Choking Tower</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
