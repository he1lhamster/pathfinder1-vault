The catalyst is highly sought for its remarkable ability to enhance and alter alchemical tools and weapons.</p><p>As a move action, you can apply the catalyst to one of the following items to enhance or alter the alchemical item's effects (items marked with an asterisk ["*"] are detailed in <em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment</em>). If the item is not used within 3 rounds, the benefit of the enhanced alchemical item is lost and the item reverts to normal. Once applied to an item, a planar alchemical catalyst is expended.</p><p><em>Alchemist's Fire</em>: The type of energy damage changes to acid, cold, or electricity (user's choice).</p><p><em>Flash Powder</em> *: The DC of the Fortitude save increases to 15, and targets are dazzled for 1d4+1 rounds whether or not they succeed at their saving throw.</p><p><em>Holy Water</em>: The splash area becomes difficult terrain for undead and evil outsiders, and undead or evil outsiders that end their turn in the affected area take 2 points of damage. Both of these effects last 3 rounds.</p><p><em>Impact Foam</em> *: The foam does not dissolve when exposed to acid or water, and instead becomes a pliable-yet-rigid platform that can be dragged onto water and used as a makeshift raft for up to 5 Medium creatures. The 10-minute duration still applies.</p><p><em>Liquid Blade</em> *: The blade deals 2 points of bleed damage on a hit (this does not stack with bleed damage from other sources).</p><p><em>Liquid Ice</em> *: In addition to its normal effects, the liquid ice acts as a smokestick, except it emits dense white fog rather than smoke.</p><p><em>Shard Gel</em> *: The shard gel remains embedded in the target on a direct hit, continuing to deal 1d3 points of damage each round after until the gel dissolves (5 rounds) or the target takes a full round action to remove it.</p><p><em>Tanglefoot Bag</em>: The DC of the Reflex saving throw increases to 17, the penalty on attack rolls is –3, and the tanglefoot bag can affect targets up to size category Huge.</p><p><em>Thunderstone</em>: In addition to being deafened, targets that fail their Fortitude saves are staggered for 1 round. Affected targets are deafened for 1d4 rounds whether or not they succeed at their saving throw.</p><h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Blood of the Elements</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
