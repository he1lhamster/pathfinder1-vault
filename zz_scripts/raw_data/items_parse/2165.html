A set of sigils consists of seven seals of stone, clay, or black iron.</p><p>The sigils' foul magic takes effect only when they are buried or hidden on the points of an imaginary seven-pointed star covering up to a 3-mile radius. Once the final sigil is set in place, the sigils create a sequence of effects, one per week, each lasting for 1 week. For the first four sigils' effects, each living creature in the area has a certain chance to be targeted each day. Each affected creature suffers the effects at a different random time during the day. The final three sigils' effects each last for a full week and target the entire area as described below.</p><p><strong>First Sigil</strong>: Each living creature in the area has a 10% chance of being affected by <em>feast of ashes</em> (Will DC 17 negates).</p><p><strong>Second Sigil</strong>: Each living creature in the area has a 20% chance of being affected by <em>rage</em> (Will DC 18 negates).</p><p><strong>Third Sigil</strong>: Each living creature in the area has a 30% chance of being affected by <em>contagion</em> with a random disease (Fortitude DC 19 negates).</p><p><strong>Fourth Sigil</strong>: Each living creature in the area has a 40% chance of being surrounded a deadly miasma and affected as per <em>cloudkill</em> (Fortitude DC 20 negates).</p><p><strong>Fifth Sigil</strong>: The area experiences severe storms as if under the effects of <em>control weather</em>.</p><p><strong>Sixth Sigil</strong>: Random 40-foot-radius spaces within the area are affected as if by <em>earthquake</em>. The earthquake affects a single 40-foot-radius space each round, then moves to a new location.</p><p><strong>Seventh Sigil</strong>: Fiery spheres fall from the sky. One sphere affects a 40-foot-radius area for 1d6 rounds, then vanishes; the next round another sphere affects a new location. A sphere deals 2d6 points of damage + 1d6 points of fire damage to creatures and objects each round (Reflex DC 23 half) and can ignite flammable materials.</p><p>Once the cycle of destruction begins, each sigil's effect can be stopped only by moving that sigil from its spot on the seven-pointed star. Moving a seal ends its effects immediately.</p><h2>Destruction</h2><p><em>Sigils of the great cataclysm</em> can be destroyed by placing a complete set in a silk bag, submerging the bag at the bottom of a nixie's pool, and casting bless water on the pool at each sunrise for 1 month.</p><h2>Tags</h2>Artifact, Evil<h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Villain Codex</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
