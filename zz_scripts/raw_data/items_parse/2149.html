The sword was handed down through the generations, finally coming into the hands of a well-respected hero of Lastwall— Mandraivus. <em>Serithtial</em> was the perfect weapon for Mandraivus's assault on Scarwall, and some scholars of history now believe that Iomedae had foreseen its need and forged it early to ensure that Mandraivus not only would inherit it, but would respect its traditions all the more.</p><p>Although made of steel, <em>Serithtial</em> is treated as if made of both cold iron and silver for the purpose of penetrating damage reduction. <em>Serithtial</em> glows with the equivalent of a <em>continual flame</em>, but its wielder can extinguish or ignite this glow as a move action. In addition, it gains a further +2 enhancement bonus and deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against foes who serve or worship Zon-Kuthon, as if it had the <em>bane</em> weapon special ability against such foes. This effect also functions against Queen Ileosa and those who directly serve her—including creatures like the dragon Zarmangarof (who serves her under magical compulsion) and the Red Mantis assassins (who serve as paid mercenaries). While <em>Serithtial</em> was forged as a bastard sword and reverts to this shape when no one wields it, when held in the hand, the sword immediately transforms into the type of blade its owner is most proficient with (choosing from dagger, short sword, longsword, scimitar, falchion, greatsword, rapier, or bastard sword—the GM can add additional sword-like weapons as she sees fit).</p><p><em>Serithtial</em> can cast <em>cure moderate wounds</em> and <em>zone of truth</em> three times per day each, and usually reserves its healing power to use on its wielder when he is reduced to 1/4 his total hit points.</p><p><em>Serithtial's</em> wielder gains the benefits of <em>death ward</em> and <em>freedom of movement</em> against attacks and effects generated by followers of Zon-Kuthon (and by extension, Queen Ileosa and her followers).</p><p>Although <em>Serithtial</em> is lawful good, as long as its wielder is dedicated to the defeat of Kazavon and those he has corrupted (such as Queen Ileosa), the sword does not attempt to seize control of its wielder. If its wielder does go against its wishes, <em>Serithtial</em> tries to force him to relinquish the blade to a more appropriate wielder. As with all holy weapons, <em>Serithtial</em> imposes 1 negative level on any evil creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the creature holds the weapon in its hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. A worshiper of Zon-Kuthon who wields <em>Serithtial</em> takes 4 negative levels and is nauseated as long as these negative levels persist. The negative levels and any additional side effects cannot be overcome in any way (including by <em>restoration</em> spells) while the weapon is wielded.</p><h2>Destruction</h2><p><em>Serithtial</em> can be destroyed only if Kazavon—restored to life—or a great wyrm shadow dragon worshiper of Zon-Kuthon uses its breath weapon on the blade while <em>Serithtial</em> is unattended.</p><h2>See also</h2><ul class="text_list"><li><a href="1343">Bastard sword</a></li></ul><h2>Tags</h2>Artifact<h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Artifacts and Legends</li><li>Curse of the Crimson Throne (PFRPG)</li><li>Pathfinder #11: Skeletons of Scarwall</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
