If a creature that already has the associated bloodline wears the amulet, the wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level of his bloodline powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of bloodline powers.</p><p><em>Aberrant</em>: This chunk of pitch-black onyx is suspended on a chain of silver. Strange whorls and tentacle-like shapes are etched upon its surface. The wearer gains a 25% chance to negate any critical hit or sneak attack (as the <em>light fortification</em> armor special ability). When making a melee touch attack, the wearer's reach increases by 5 feet. Moderate illusion; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>blur</em>, <em>enlarge person</em>.</p><p><em>Abyssal</em>: This amulet is a chunk of bright red garnet in which fire seems to dance when light plays across its surface. It hangs from a chain of brass. The wearer gains electricity resistance 5 and a +2 bonus on saving throws against poison. In addition, the wearer can grow claws as a free action. The claws are treated as natural weapons, and allows the wearer to make two claw attacks as a full attack action using his full base attack bonus. The claws deal 1d4 points of damage each (1d3 if the wearer is Small) plus the wearer's Strength modifier. Moderate abjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>delay poison</em>, <em>magic fang</em>, <em>resist energy</em>.</p><p><em>Accursed</em>: This swirling green malachite hangs from a chain of oxidized copper. Sinister, unblinking eyes are etched upon its surface. The wearer gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against charm, cold, fear, fire, and sleep effects. Three times per day as a standard action, the wearer can fix his gaze on any one creature within 60 feet. The target becomes staggered for 4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC 18). Only one target can be affected by the wearer's gaze at a time; if the wearer attempts to stagger a new opponent, the previous target immediately recovers whether the new attempt is successful or not. Moderate necromancy; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>bestow curse</em>, <em>resist energy</em>, <em>resistance</em>.</p><p><em>Celestial</em>: This large, polished opal hangs from a chain of smoky gray steel. The wearer gains acid resistance 5 and cold resistance 5. Three times per day as a standard action, the wearer can unleash a ray of heavenly fire as a ranged touch attack, targeting any foe within 30 feet. Against evil creatures, the ray deals 1d4+4 points of damage. The damage is divine and not subject to energy resistance or immunity. The ray heals good creatures of 1d4+4 points of damage, but a good creature cannot benefit from the heavenly fire more than once per day. Neutral creatures are unaffected by the ray. Moderate abjuration and evocation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>resist energy</em>, <em>scorching ray</em>.</p><p><em>Destined</em>: This chunk of uncut quartz hangs on a platinum chain. The wearer gains a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws and to AC during surprise rounds or any time he is otherwise unaware of an attack. Once per day, the wearer can reroll one attack roll, critical hit confirmation roll, or caster level check to overcome spell resistance. He must decide to use this ability after the first roll is made but before the result is revealed. He must take the second result, even if it's lower. Moderate enchantment; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>aid</em>.</p><p><em>Draconic</em>: This amulet comes in a variety of minerals depending on its powers, as shown in the table below, and is formed into the shape of a dragon's scale. The wearer gains resistance 5 against the energy type shown in the table, as well as a +1 natural armor bonus to AC. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can produce a breath weapon. This breath weapon deals 4d6 points of damage of the energy type and shape listed (Reflex DC 13 half). Moderate abjuration and evocation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>fire breath</em>, <em>resist energy</em>.</p><p><table><tr><td><strong>d%</strong></td><td><strong>Material</strong></td><td><strong>Energy Type</strong></td><td><strong>Breath Shape</strong></td></tr><tr><td>01–25</td><td>Malachite</td><td>Acid</td><td>60-foot line</td></tr><tr><td>26–50</td><td>Azurite</td><td>Electricity</td><td>60-foot line</td></tr><tr><td>51–75</td><td>Red Agate</td><td>Fire</td><td>30-foot cone</td></tr><tr><td>76–100</td><td>Calcite</td><td>Cold</td><td>30-foot cone</td></tr></table><em>Elemental</em>: This amulet comes in a variety of minerals depending on its powers, as shown in the table below.

The wearer can turn invisible for 9 rounds per day (as <em>greater invisibility</em>). The rounds don't need to be consecutive. Three times per day, the wearer can make a melee touch attack to cause a creature to burst out laughing. That creature can take only a move action, but can defend itself normally. Once a creature has been affected by this laughter, it is immune to it for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. Moderate illusion; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>greater invisibility</em>, <em>hideous laughter</em>.</p><p><em>Infernal</em>: This chunk of black marble hangs from a chain of brass. The wearer gains fire resistance 5 and a +2 bonus on saving throws against poison. Three times per day the wearer can make a melee touch attack to cause a creature to become shaken for 4 rounds. Multiple touches do not stack, but do add to the duration. Moderate abjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>chill touch</em>, <em>resist energy</em>.</p><p><em>Undead</em>: This chunk of petrified bone dangles from a silver chain. The wearer gains cold resistance 5 and DR 5/— against nonlethal damage. Three times per day the wearer can make a melee touch attack to cause a creature to become shaken for 4 rounds.
