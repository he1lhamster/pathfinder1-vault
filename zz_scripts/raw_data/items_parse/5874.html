This change is a visual illusion (glamer) effect akin to <em>disguise self</em>.</p><p>The wearer of <em>vestments of false faith</em> gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate a member of the faith she has chosen (this doesn't stack with <em>disguise self</em> and similar effects). She also gains a +5 competence bonus on Use Magic Device checks to activate items that duplicate divine spells or emulate a specific religion or alignment, provided they fit the religion she's imitating. If she uses a magic item to produce the effect of a divine spell, she can make it appear to observers as though she were casting the spell, though a Spellcraft check to identify the spell being cast can identify it as coming from a magic item if the result exceeds the DC by 5 or more.</p><p>The wearer's alignment is disguised while wearing <em>vestments of false faith</em>, so that it appears identical to that of the deity whose holy symbol she bears, and her aura is as strong as if she had a number of cleric levels equal to her Hit Dice. This primarily affects alignment detection; however, once per day as an immediate action, she can function as if she actually had that alignment when she would normally be affected by an alignment-based effect, such as <em>blasphemy, chaos hammer, forbiddance</em>, or an <em>unholy</em> magic weapon. This effect persists until the end of the wearer's next turn, after which any non-instantaneous effects (such as <em>smite evil</em>) suddenly revert to having the effects they would normally have on a creature of her true alignment.</p><h2>Crafting requirements</h2><p><strong>Crafting cost: </strong>13500 gp</p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>bless, disguise self, misdirection</em><h2>See also</h2><ul class="text_list"><li><a href="3012">Chaos Hammer</a></li><li><a href="595">Hammer</a></li></ul><h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Ultimate Intrigue</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
