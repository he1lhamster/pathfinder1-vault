The <em>Totemrix</em> is a manifestation of power from the now-dead demon lord of shadows, Vyriavaxus. It's a DC 30 Knowledge (religion) check to know this, but any evilaligned creature that touches the <em>Totemrix</em> immediately knows the name and how to use the artifact's powers. The <em>Totemrix</em> constantly emits <em>darkness</em>, as per the spell of the same name, reducing illumination levels in a 20-foot radius by one step.</p><p>As long as the <em>Totemrix</em> is carried, the wielder's demeanor and attitude become increasingly morbid. After a day of keeping the <em>Totemrix</em> in his possession, its owner becomes incredibly possessive of the artifact and will not voluntarily relinquish it—if the wielder loses possession of the <em>Totemrix</em>, he becomes obsessed with recovering it. Every day that the owner maintains possession of the <em>Totemrix</em>, he gains 1 "shadow point." When the owner's shadow point total equals his experience level, he must make a DC 25 Fortitude save. Regardless of the results of this save, the owner dies—if the Fortitude save is a success, though, he rises the next evening as a vampire. If a player character succumbs to this potent curse and becomes a vampire, you should assume control of that PC until the other characters can defeat him and, hopefully, resurrect him. The compulsion to maintain ownership of the <em>Totemrix</em> is a curse that functions at CL 15th.</p><p>A vampire created in this manner continues to covet the <em>Totemrix</em>, and indeed, if separated from its ownership (or unable to benefit from its power, as in the case of it being joined to the <em>Morrowfall</em>), suffers a –4 penalty on all skill checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until he recovers the artifact.</p><p>In the hands of a vampire, the <em>Totemrix</em> gains a potent new ability—when the vampire uses his children of the night ability, he may call upon shadow beasts. When he calls upon shadow beasts, he calls 2d6 shadowgarms (see <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path</em> volume #25), 1d4 shadow rat swarms (see page 37), 1d4+1 shadows, or 1d3 shadow mastiffs (see page 31). Although the vampire can only do so as often as he can use children of the night (once a day for most vampires), shadow beasts called in this manner persist in the area and follow the vampire's last command until they are slain or banished. At any one time, a vampiric wielder of the <em>Totemrix</em> can maintain a number of shadow beasts equal to the amount of spawn he can control (up to 52 at a time for Ilnerik); attempts to call more shadow beasts while this total number is maxed still function, but the called shadow beasts persist for only up to 1 hour before vanishing.</p><h2>Destruction</h2><p>When the <em>Totemrix</em> is joined with its counterpart, the <em>Morrowfall</em>, its powers (as well as those of the <em>Morrowfall</em>) are suppressed. In this state, both it and the <em>Morrowfall</em> can be destroyed by anything capable of destroying a magic metal object of its size.</p><h2>Tags</h2>Artifact<h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Pathfinder #29: Mother of Flies</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
