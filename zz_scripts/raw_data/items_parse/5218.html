The power of a <em>player's prize</em> comes not from possessing it, however, but from giving it to an unsuspecting audience member. By inscribing a personal rune on his <em>player's prize</em>, a bard can cause whoever carries the item (knowingly or not) to be more susceptible to his bardic performances. Once inscribed, a <em>player's prize</em> can not be keyed to any other creature. Devious bards use Sleight of Hand to drop their <em>player's prize</em> on rivals' or foes' persons, usually in a backpack or in among other gear where it would be difficult to locate.</p><p>A creature carrying a <em>player's prize</em> keyed to a bard within 30 feet takes a –2 penalty on Will saves against that bard's bardic performances, as well as a –2 penalty on opposed skill checks against any skill checks the bard attempts using his versatile performance class feature. These penalties remain as long as the affected creature continues to carry the <em>player's prize</em>.</p><p>Once per day as an immediate action, the character whose personal rune is inscribed on the <em>player's prize</em> can speak the item's command word to cause the statue to instantly appear in his hand. The character must be within 30 feet of the <em>player's prize</em> to activate this ability.</p><h2>Crafting requirements</h2><p><strong>Crafting cost: </strong>1500 gp</p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>bestow curse</em>, <em>telekinesis</em><h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>People of the River</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
