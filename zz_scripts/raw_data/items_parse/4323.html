When the figurine is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak.</p><p>If a <em>figurine of wondrous power</em> is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time.</p><p><strong>Silver Raven</strong>: This silver figurine turns into a raven on command (but it retains its metallic consistency, which gives it hardness 10). Another command sends it off into the air, bearing a message just like a creature affected by an <em>animal messenger</em> spell. If not commanded to carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its owner, although it has no special powers or telepathic abilities. It can maintain its nonfigurine status for only 24 hours per week, but the duration need not be continuous.; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>animal messenger</em>, <em>animate objects</em>.</p><p><strong>Coral Hippocampus</strong>: When animated, this <em>figurine of wondrous</em> power (<em>Core Rulebook</em> 513) acts in all ways like a normal combat-trained hippocampus (<em>Bestiary 2</em> 155). The item can be used three times per week for up to 12 hours per use. When 12 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the coral hippocampus again becomes a tiny statuette.; CL 19th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>animate objects</em>.</p><p><strong>Emerald Frog</strong>: This <em>figurine of wondrous power</em> appears as a small, innocuous frog carved of cloudy emerald. On command, it transforms into either a giant frog with the advanced template or 3 poisonous frogs—the user makes this choice at the time of activation. The frog (or frogs) can be animated up to 3 times per week, for a maximum total duration of 12 hours per week. If the advanced giant frog is slain, the <em>emerald frog</em> cannot be activated again for 1 full week. Each poisonous frog that is slain in combat reduces the total duration that the figurine can be activated for the week by 4 hours.</p><p>Either the giant frog or the poisonous frogs can be used as combatants or as small, unintelligent servant-creatures, performing minor tasks or fetching small objects. The giant frog can be used by Small or smaller creatures as a makeshift mount, although it is not equipped with a saddle or similar equipment, and its slick hide imposes an additional –4 penalty on Ride attempts.; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>animate objects</em>.</p><p><strong>Lapis Camel</strong>: This palm-sized camel figurine is sculpted of lapis lazuli. When you throw the <em>lapis camel</em> to the ground and speak the command word, it turns into a dromedary camel. The camel acts as a normal camel in all respects, except that it obeys your verbal commands to the best of its animal-level intelligence. At your command, the camel returns to its figurine form. The <em>lapis camel</em> can be used up to 3 times per week for up 8 hours each use.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>animate object</em>.</p><p><strong>Pearl Dolphin</strong>: This 2-inch-long pearl figurine turns into a dolphin on command (but it retains its composition, which gives it hardness 10). The dolphin follows the verbal commands of the creature who spoke the command word and will follow commands as a summoned creature. With a second command word, the dolphin will swim to an indicated location at double its swim speed, bearing a message just like a creature affected by an <em>animal messenger</em> spell.</p><p>The <em>pearl dolphin</em> can maintain its nonfigurine status for only 24 hours per week. The duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-hour increments.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>animal messenger</em>, <em>animate objects</em>.</p><p><strong>Ruby Butterfly</strong>: Upon command, this <em>figurine of wondrous power</em> transforms into a hand-sized red butterfly (same statistics as a bat). A spellcaster can use a ruby butterfly to deliver touch spells, as if the <em>ruby butterfly</em> were a familiar capable of this ability. A ruby butterfly can also be commanded to guard its owner while he sleeps. Creatures protected this way gain a +5 luck bonus on saving throws against any spell or effect that affects sleeping creatures' dreams (such as <em>nightmare</em> or a night hag's dream haunting ability). A ruby butterfly can be used three times per week for up to 8 hours at a time.; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>animate object</em>, <em>dream</em>.</p><p><strong>Black Jade Raven</strong>: This fist-sized piece of black jade is exquisitely tooled into the shape of a raven with outstretched wings. Upon command, it transforms into a black raven (use the stats for an eagle) or a giant black raven (use the stats for a giant eagle). Both forms of the raven have Improved Steal as a bonus feat. The raven understands Common but cannot speak. It can answer questions related to its abilities or what it has seen by cawing once for "yes" and twice for "no."</p><p>The raven can maintain its non-figurine status for only 24 hours per week. This duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-hour increments. After three transformations into its giant raven form (though not its smaller version), the statuette loses all magical properties.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>animate objects</em>.</p><p><strong>Serpentine Eagle</strong>: This Andoren variant of the <em>serpentine owl</em> can be transformed into an eagle or giant eagle but is otherwise identical to the owl figurine. <em>Serpentine eagles</em> are popular among Eagle Knights for scouting and emergency transportation.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>animate objects</em>.</p><p><strong>Serpentine Owl</strong>: This figurine becomes either a normal-sized horned owl or a giant owl (use the stats for the giant eagle) according to the command word used. The transformation can take place once per day, with a maximum duration of 8 continuous hours. However, after three transformations into giant owl form, the statuette loses all its magical properties. The owl communicates with its owner by telepathic means, informing her of all it sees and hears.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>animate objects</em>.</p><p><strong>Bronze Griffon</strong>: When animated, a bronze griffon acts in all ways like a normal griffon under the command of its possessor. The item can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use. When 6 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the bronze griffon once again becomes a tiny statuette.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>animate objects</em>.</p><p><strong>Ebony Fly</strong>: When animated, an ebony fly is the size of a pony and has all the statistics of a pegasus but can make no attacks. The item can be used three times per week for up to 12 hours per use. When 12 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the ebony fly again becomes a tiny statuette.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>animate objects</em>.</p><p><strong>Hematite Courgar</strong>: This palm-sized figurine of a cat with a spiked tail is made of gleaming hematite. A hematite cougar turns into a digmaul (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 5</em> 82) that is fully obedient to the figurine's owner. Even in its animated form, the hematite cougar is made of dense metal, granting it a +2 armor bonus to AC and a +2 bonus to its CMD. An animated hematite cougar conducts low levels of electricity; creatures adjacent to the hematite cougar gain electricity resistance 2, but any damage prevented by this ability is dealt to the hematite cougar instead. A hematite cougar can be animated twice per week for up to 8 hours per use; speaking the command word before the 8 hours expires returns the hematite cougar to a figurine.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>animate objects</em>, <em>resist energy</em>.</p><p><strong>Slate Spider</strong>: This statuette of a spider with stubby legs can be used once per day for 1 minute. When activated, the figurine sprouts longer, segmented legs, and scampers about the bearer, picking lint off robes, chiseling grime from armor, or otherwise grooming the bearer. If commanded to do so (a free action), it perches on the muzzle of a one-handed or two-handed firearm barrel and, after the firearm is fired, travels down the barrel and cleans out the firearm. Each time the slate spider cleans a firearm, the next shot the firearm fires has no chance of misfiring.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>animate objects</em>.</p><p><strong>Tin Imp</strong>: These fat, smirking imp figurines are made of solid tin. A <em>tin imp</em> turns into an imp (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em> 78) on command, though it retains its metallic consistency, which gives it a +4 armor bonus to AC. In imp form, a <em>tin imp</em> can turn invisible at will as a swift action, though it retains none of an imp's other spelllike abilities and lacks a poisoned sting. <em>Tin imps</em> generally avoid combat, but make excellent spies and trackers.</p><p>The <em>tin imp's</em> owner can, as a move action, designate a single creature in his line of sight as the <em>tin imp's</em> quarry. The <em>tin imp</em> then follows its quarry clandestinely, and sends a whispered message to its owner once each hour detailing the quarry's location and activities. The message is similar to the <em>whispering wind</em> spell, though the message unerringly locates the <em>tin imp's</em> owner instead of moving to a predetermined location. A <em>tin imp</em> can maintain its animate status for up to 48 hours per week. This duration doesn't need to be continuous, but must be used in 1-hour increments. If slain in combat, a <em>tin imp</em> is destroyed.</p><p>Additionally, a creature with the track class feature can command a <em>tin imp</em> he owns to study a set of footprints (a standard action) and designate the creature that made the footprints as its quarry. The <em>tin imp</em> can then attempt to track the creature as if its owner was tracking it, using the owner's Perception and Survival skill (and any tracking bonuses).; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>animate objects</em>, <em>invisibility</em>, <em>whispering wind</em>.</p><p><strong>Glass Walrus</strong>: This <em>figurine of wondrous power</em> is shaped like a walrus and is carved out of a prismatic crystal. It follows all the normal rules for <em>figurines of wondrous power</em> (<em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em> 513). When animated, a glass walrus acts in all ways like a normal walrus (see page 29) except it can glide along the surface of water as though under the constant effects of <em>water walk</em>. Up to two Medium creatures or four Small creatures can fit on a glass walrus's back as the creature glides across water (the walrus moves at half speed while carrying creatures), and the walrus can carry up to 600 pounds in this way before it becomes too encumbered to move. A glass walrus can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use. When 6 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the glass walrus again becomes a tiny statuette.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>animate objects</em>, <em>water walk</em>.</p><p><strong>Obsidian Raven</strong>: This <em>figurine of wondrous power</em> is similar to a <em>silver raven</em>, but it can be used to send messages across the planes. On command, the figurine turns into a raven (retaining its stone-like consistency, which gives it hardness 8). Another command sends it off into the air, bearing a message as the <em>sending</em> spell (with no chance of the message not arriving). The recipient of the message can then use the <em>obsidian raven</em> to <em>plane shift</em> (self only) to the plane from which the message was sent. The figurine can be used in this way once per day. If not commanded to carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its owner, although it has no special abilities, and it can maintain its non-figurine status for 24 hours per week (the duration need not be continuous).; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>animate objects</em>, <em>plane shift</em>, <em>sending</em>.</p><p><strong>Onyx Dog</strong>: When commanded, this statuette changes into a creature with the same properties as a riding dog except that it is endowed with an Intelligence of 8, can communicate in Common, and has exceptional olfactory and visual abilities. It has the scent ability and adds +4 on its Perception checks. It has 60-foot darkvision, and it can <em>see invisibility</em>. An onyx dog can be used once per week for up to 6 hours. It obeys only its owner.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>animate objects</em>.</p><p><strong>Golden Lions</strong>: These figurines come in pairs. They become normal adult male lions. If slain in combat, the lions cannot be brought back from statuette form for 1 full week. Otherwise, they can be used once per day for up to 1 hour. They enlarge and shrink upon speaking the command word.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>animate objects</em>.</p><p><strong>Marble Elephant</strong>: This is the largest of the figurines, the statuette being about the size of a human hand. Upon utterance of the command word, a marble elephant grows to the size and specifications of a true elephant. The animal created from the statuette is fully obedient to the figurine's owner, serving as a beast of burden, a mount, or a combatant. The statuette can be used four times per month for up to 24 hours at a time.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>animate objects</em>.</p><p><strong>Ivory Goats</strong>: These figurines come in threes. Each goat of this trio looks slightly different from the others, and each has a different function:</p><ul><li><em>The Goat of Traveling</em>: This statuette provides a speedy and enduring mount equal to that of a heavy horse in every way except appearance. The goat can travel for a maximum of 1 day each week—continuously or in any combination of periods totaling 24 hours. At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for no less than 1 day before it can again be used.</li><li><em>The Goat of Travail</em>: This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of a nightmare except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each successful attack in that round). It can be called to life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time.</li><li><em>The Goat of Terror</em>: When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount with the statistics of a light horse. However, its rider can employ the goat's horns as weapons (one horn as a <em>+3 heavy lance</em>, the other as a <em>+5 longsword</em>). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the goat of terror radiates fear as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC 16 partial). It can be used once every 2 weeks for up to 3 hours per use.</li></ul><p>; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>animate objects</em>.</p><p><strong>Obsidian Steed</strong>: This figurine appears to be a small, shapeless lump of black stone. Only careful inspection reveals that it vaguely resembles some form of quadruped. On command, the near-formless piece of obsidian becomes a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy horse with the following additional powers usable once per round at will: <em>overland flight</em>, <em>plane shift</em>, and <em>ethereal jaunt</em>. The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an obsidian steed becomes ethereal or plane shifts, its rider and his gear follow suit. Thus, the user can travel to other planes via this means.; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em>animate objects</em>, <em>etherealness</em>, <em>fly</em>, <em>plane shift</em>.</p><p><strong>Basalt Dragon</strong>: This fist-sized, carved dragon is sculpted from volcanic rock. It becomes either a pseudodragon or a flame drake (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</em> 106), depending on the command word used. The transformation can take place twice per day, with a maximum duration of 2 continuous hours. The pseudodragon can use its telepathy to communicate with its owner over any distance, but not across planes.</p><p>By expending one use of mythic power, the user of the figurine can instead transform the figurine into a young red dragon. If the user is at least 5th tier, she can instead expend two uses of mythic power to transform the figurine into an adult red dragon. If the user is at least 9th tier, she can instead expend four uses of mythic power to transform the figurine into an ancient red dragon. Transforming the figurine into a true dragon renders the figurine powerless for 1 week after the transformation ends.; CL 20th; Craft Wondrous Item, Mythic Crafter, animate objects, <em>form of the dragon III</em>, <em>telepathic bond</em>.</p><h2>Crafting requirements</h2><p><strong>Crafting cost: </strong>3500 gp</p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>animate objects</em><h2>See also</h2><ul class="text_list"><li><a href="4171">Effigy of the Favored Servant</a></li><li><a href="4319">Figurine of Wondrous Power (Basalt Dragon)</a></li><li><a href="4320">Figurine of Wondrous Power (Black Jade Raven)</a></li><li><a href="4321">Figurine of Wondrous Power (Bronze Griffon)</a></li><li><a href="4322">Figurine of Wondrous Power (Coral Hippocampus)</a></li><li><a href="4323">Figurine of Wondrous Power (Ebony Fly)</a></li><li><a href="4325">Figurine of Wondrous Power (Glass Walrus)</a></li><li><a href="4326">Figurine of Wondrous Power (Golden Lions)</a></li><li><a href="4327">Figurine of Wondrous Power (Hematite Courgar)</a></li><li><a href="4328">Figurine of Wondrous Power (Ivory Goats)</a></li><li><a href="4329">Figurine of Wondrous Power (Lapis Camel)</a></li><li><a href="4330">Figurine of Wondrous Power (Marble Elephant)</a></li><li><a href="4331">Figurine of Wondrous Power (Obsidian Raven)</a></li><li><a href="4332">Figurine of Wondrous Power (Obsidian Steed)</a></li><li><a href="4333">Figurine of Wondrous Power (Onyx Dog)</a></li><li><a href="4334">Figurine of Wondrous Power (Pearl Dolphin)</a></li><li><a href="4335">Figurine of Wondrous Power (Ruby Butterfly)</a></li><li><a href="4336">Figurine of Wondrous Power (Serpentine Eagle)</a></li><li><a href="4337">Figurine of Wondrous Power (Serpentine Owl)</a></li><li><a href="4338">Figurine of Wondrous Power (Silver Raven)</a></li><li><a href="4339">Figurine of Wondrous Power (Slate Spider)</a></li><li><a href="4340">Figurine of Wondrous Power (Tin Imp)</a></li><li><a href="1526">Lance</a></li><li><a href="1544">Longsword</a></li><li><a href="2342">Unlucky Figurine</a></li></ul><h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Advanced Class Guide</li><li>Advanced Race Guide</li><li>Andoran, Spirit of Liberty</li><li>Animal Archive</li><li>Aquatic Adventures</li><li>Core Rulebook</li><li>Elemental Master's Handbook</li><li>Legacy of Fire Player's Guide</li><li>Mythic Adventures</li><li>Pathfinder #34: Blood for Blood</li><li>Pathfinder #70: The Frozen Stars</li><li>Pathfinder #122: Into the Shattered Continent</li><li>Seers of the Drowned City</li><li>Ultimate Combat</li><li>Ultimate Equipment</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
