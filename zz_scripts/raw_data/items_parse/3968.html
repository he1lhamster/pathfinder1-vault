For those who can afford them, <em>clockwork prostheses</em> —miraculous metallic extremities fused with a small amount of primal magic—offer an elegant solution to missing limbs.</p><p>Once purchased, a <em>clockwork prosthesis</em> is attached to the area where a limb once was—a prosthesis can't be added in addition to an already existing limb. Only humanoid creatures can equip themselves with <em>clockwork prostheses</em>, which must be installed by a trained prosthesis merchant. As a <em>clockwork prosthesis</em> is installed (a process that takes no less than 1 hour), the bearer must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or the prosthesis doesn't take hold. Either way, the bearer takes 2 points of Constitution damage from the surgery. <em>Clockwork prostheses</em> commonly come in two types—arms and legs.</p><p><em>Clockwork Arm</em>: A <em>clockwork arm</em> allows its bearer to lift up to 1-1/2 times his maximum load over his head. A humanoid with two <em>clockwork arms</em> can lift up to twice his maximum load over his head. In addition, a <em>clockwork arm</em> allows its bearer to deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike and provides a +10 bonus to its bearer's CMD against attempts to disarm a weapon held in that hand. For the appropriate price, a clockwork arm can be enchanted with any weapon special ability so long as the ability can be applied to unarmed attacks.</p><p><em>Clockwork Leg</em>: A <em>clockwork leg</em> allows its bearer to lift up to 2-1/2 times his maximum load off the ground (instead of double). A humanoid with two <em>clockwork legs</em> can lift up to 3 times his maximum load off the ground and stagger around with it. In addition, each installed <em>clockwork leg</em> grants its bearer a +4 bonus to CMD against trip and bull rush attempts.</p><p>The <em>clockwork prostheses</em> detailed here are only the most common types of <em>clockwork prostheses</em>. Other, more specialized <em>clockwork prostheses</em> capable of transforming into firearms, pinning opponents, and even channeling magical energy are also rumored to exist.</p><h2>Crafting requirements</h2><p><strong>Crafting cost: </strong>3200 gp</p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>bull's strength</em>, <em>regenerate</em>, creator must have 8 ranks in Craft (clockwork)<h2>See also</h2><ul class="text_list"><li><a href="3966">Clockwork Arm</a></li></ul><h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Magical Marketplace</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
