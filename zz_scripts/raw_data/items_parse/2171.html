Ydersius's clerics still receive spells from their prayers, granted by the skull regardless of its location or ownership. There is no way a mortal can block this effect. Possession of the skull grants several abilities.</p><p><em>Blessing of Scales</em>: All reptilian creatures (including worshipers of Ydersius, sorcerers with the serpentine or draconic bloodline, and druids wild-shaped into reptilian forms) within 160 feet of the <em>Skull of Ydersius</em> gain spell resistance 25 and fast healing 10.</p><p><em>Unholy Aura</em>: The skull treats the 80-foot-radius area around it as though an <em>unhallow</em> spell had been cast with the <em>Skull of Ydersius</em> as the point of origin. This effect carries with it two linked spells that affect only worshipers of Ydersius (<em>death ward</em> and <em>freedom of movement</em>), and two linked spells that affect all non-worshipers of Ydersius (<em>bane</em> and <em>dimensional anchor</em>).</p><p><em>Voice of the Serpent</em>: Once per day, a creature that touches the skull may cast <em>commune</em> to speak with Ydersius. A non-worshiper of Ydersius who uses this power must make a successful DC 25 Will save each time the power is used to avoid succumbing to a <em>feeblemind</em> spell.</p><p>Any good-aligned creature that carries the <em>Skull of Ydersius</em>, even via an extradimensional space such as a <em>portable hole</em>, gains three negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the skull is carried and disappear when the skull is released. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including <em>restoration</em> spells) while the skull is carried. A creature that suffers from these negative levels has a 50% spell failure chance on all divine spellcasting attempts.</p><h2>Destruction</h2><p>The only way to destroy the <em>Skull of Ydersius</em> is to reunite it with Ydersius's mindless, decapitated body. Doing so returns Ydersius to life, though in a weakened state. This manifestation can be combated and even slain, though it regenerates from nearly any wound short of re-decapitation. For an instant, before the whole body begins to regenerate, Ydersius's spirit is untethered from his form. If Ydersius is dragged to the Boneyard and slain in Pharasma's presence, the goddess of death can judge the serpent god, causing his body and skull to disintegrate to dust.</p><h2>See also</h2><ul class="text_list"><li><a href="5236">Portable Hole</a></li></ul><h2>Tags</h2>Artifact<h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Artifacts and Legends</li><li>Pathfinder #42: Sanctum of the Serpent God</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
