In the hands of a paladin, the <em>Thorncrown</em> reveals its true powers, bursting into flames and spinning above the wearer's head in a halo of divine power. Paladins of any faith who wear the <em>Thorncrown</em> have their class abilities enhanced for as long as they wear it, gaining three additional mercies (from levels they have access to but have not selected), healing the maximum amount possible every time they use lay on hands, and gaining a number of additional uses of smite evil equal to their Charisma modifier. Additionally, if a paladin wearing the <em>Thorncrown</em> is slain, she may choose to instantly be restored to full hit points for a number of minutes equal to her Charisma modifier. She may act as normal for this period, but at the end of this time she dies and cannot be restored by any means short of a <em>miracle</em> cast by a cleric of her faith.</p><p>The <em>Thorncrown of Iomedae</em> bestows two negative levels on any evil creature that wears it. These negative levels remain as long as the <em>Thorncrown</em> is held or worn—though they never result in actual level loss, they cannot be overcome in any way (including <em>restoration</em> spells) while the creature possesses the <em>Thorncrown</em>. Additionally, paladins who either break their code of conduct while wearing the <em>Thorncrown</em> or do not have access to their class features when they don the artifact must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or instantly be disintegrated. Those slain by the <em>Thorncrown</em> cannot be brought back to life by clerics with good or lawful components to their alignment—their spells simply fail—though clerics of other alignments can restore a paladin as normal. Even those who succeed at this save are treated as though they were evil creatures and gain negative levels. Paladins who receive atonement can wear the <em>Thorncrown</em> again without fear of ill effects.</p><h2>Destruction</h2><p>If a paladin temporarily restored to life by the <em>Thorncrown of Iomedae</em> forsakes her deity and, of her own free will, swears herself to an evil force, the crown consumes the wearer in holy flames, destroying itself and its wearer utterly. Nothing can restore a traitorous paladin killed in this way.</p><h2>See also</h2><ul class="text_list"><li><a href="4029">Crown of Blasting (Major)</a></li><li><a href="4030">Crown of Blasting (Minor)</a></li></ul><h2>Tags</h2>Artifact<h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Artifacts and Legends</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
