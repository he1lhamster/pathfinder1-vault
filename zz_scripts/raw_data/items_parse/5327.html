Happily, he found the crafting and use of these scroll-like devices a handy remedy for the crippling nausea he normally suffered whenever he cast a spell. The secrets of this magic's rediscovery and details of its use are fully detailed in the Pathfinder Tales novel <em>Prince of Wolves</em>.</p><p>A <em>riffle scroll</em> is similar to a standard scroll, but its methods of activation and shape are quite different. A <em>riffle scroll</em> is a wondrous item that holds the power of a single spell. Each <em>riffle scroll</em> is a thin booklet, similar in shape to a chapbook (but somewhat smaller), containing 25 to 50 pages of eldritch symbols. When held between thumb and forefinger and riffled through in a quick manner, the motion of the pages turning activates the magic within, simultaneously completing casting of the spell and erasing the booklet.</p><p>A <em>riffle scroll</em> uses spell completion as its activation type, just as do normal scrolls. Characters who cannot cast the spell contained in a <em>riffle scroll</em> must rely on Use Magic Device to activate the magic held within. <em>Riffle scrolls</em> are treated exactly as scrolls for the purposes of deciphering the writing, activating the spell, and determining its effects (including the chances for mishaps), save for the fact that <em>riffle scrolls</em> do not require verbal components—they automatically function as if they were cast using the Silent Spell metamagic feat. Activating a <em>riffle scroll</em> provokes attacks of opportunity just like casting a spell. Magical silence does not interfere with using a <em>riffle scroll</em>. Activating a <em>riffle scroll</em> requires one free hand. A <em>riffle scroll</em> uses the normal casting time for the inscribed spell, even if the user or creator is of a class that has increased casting times when using metamagic effects.</p><p><em>Riffle scrolls</em> are somewhat heavier than normal scrolls; a single <em>riffle scroll</em> weighs 1 pound. Each <em>riffle scroll</em> has an AC of 9, 5 hit points, hardness 0, and a break DC of 10. Riffle scrolls cannot be kept in standard scroll tubes; they are normally transported in flat leather cases or boxes similar to containers used to transport books.</p><p><em>Riffle scrolls</em> can be created by any spellcaster who has the Scribe Scroll and Silent Spell feats. Scribing a <em>riffle scroll</em> is more time-consuming and expensive than scribing normal scrolls because of the greater number of pages and more complex magic involved. A <em>riffle scroll</em> 's market price is equal to the spell level × the caster's level × 25 gp—but note that only spells that have been modified by the Silent Spell metamagic feat can be crafted into <em>riffle scrolls</em>. This affects the spell's effective spell level for the purposes of determining the <em>riffle scroll</em> 's price. Effectively, a <em>riffle scroll</em> costs about the same as a normal scroll of one spell level higher. This also means that 9th-level spells cannot be made into <em>riffle scrolls</em>, because there are no 10th-level spell slots. Abilities that reduce the level adjustment of the Silent Spell feat do not affect <em>riffle scrolls</em>.</p><p>To scribe a <em>riffle scroll</em>, you must use up raw materials costing half of its market price. Scribing a <em>riffle scroll</em> takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in its base price, with a minimum of 1 day of work. Although an individual <em>riffle scroll</em> might contain more than one spell, each spell must be scribed as a separate effort, meaning that no more than 1 spell can be scribed in a day.</p><h2>Crafting requirements</h2><p><strong>Crafting cost: </strong>1137.5 gp</p>Scibe Scroll, Silent Spell, the spell to be scribed<h2>See also</h2><ul class="text_list"><li><a href="5323">Riffle Scroll (1st Spell)</a></li><li><a href="5324">Riffle Scroll (2nd-Level Spell)</a></li><li><a href="5325">Riffle Scroll (3rd-Level Spell)</a></li><li><a href="5326">Riffle Scroll (4th-Level Spell)</a></li><li><a href="5327">Riffle Scroll (5th-Level Spell)</a></li><li><a href="5329">Riffle Scroll (7th-Level Spell)</a></li><li><a href="5330">Riffle Scroll (8th-Level Spell)</a></li><li><a href="5331">Riffle Scroll (Cantrip)</a></li></ul><h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Inner Sea Magic</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
