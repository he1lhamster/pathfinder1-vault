As soon as one of the deck's cards is drawn at random, though, its nature becomes apparent and an effect determined by the chosen card is bestowed upon the user—often to life-altering effect.</p><p>A bearer of a <em>Harrow Deck of Many Things</em> who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards he will draw before doing so. These cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw any more cards from the deck than he announced (unless the effect of a drawn card states otherwise). If the character does not willingly draw his allotted number or is somehow prevented from doing so, the cards flip out of the deck on their own after 1 hour. Future attempts to draw cards from the deck made by someone who has already drawn his allotted number reveal only blank cards.</p><p>Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced, making it possible to draw the same card twice. A <em>Harrow Deck of Many Things</em> contains 54 cards, with the effects of each detailed in the following Effects of the Harrow section.</p><h2>Destruction</h2><p>The <em>Harrow Deck of Many Things</em> possesses a strange sort of selfpreservation. If the deck is damaged—regardless of how much damage it takes—one card is destroyed and the deck randomly teleports somewhere else on the plane. If it is somehow pursued and damaged again within 1 minute, another card is destroyed and the deck teleports again. If this process is repeated until no cards are remaining, the deck is destroyed. If the deck is not entirely destroyed, destroyed cards reappear at a rate of 1 per hour.</p><h2>Tags</h2>Artifact<h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Artifacts and Legends</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
