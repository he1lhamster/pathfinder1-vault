A direct hit from a fiery boulder deals 2d6 points of fire damage and 5 points of fire damage to every creature affected by its splash damage. All creatures affected by a fiery boulder's direct damage take an additional 2d6 points of fire damage the following round; affected creatures can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage.</p><h3>Greater Splash Weapon</h3><p>This splash weapon works in some ways like a normal splash weapon (<em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em> 202), but its effects cover a larger area. Like a normal splash weapon, a greater splash weapon requires no weapon proficiency, and you throw it by making a ranged touch attack. A hit deals direct hit damage to the target and to creatures and objects in squares within 5 feet of that target. It then deals splash damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the target. If the target takes up more than a 5-foot square, you can chose one of its squares as the center of the effect. The direct damage affects the squares normally, so a Large or larger creature could take both the direct damage and the splash damage depending on the square you choose. The splash damage for a greater splash weapon is 5 points of the appropriate damage type for the weapon.</p><p>Like a normal splash weapon, you can also choose to target a specific grid intersection (treating it as a ranged attack against AC 5). If it hits, the greater splash weapon deals direct damage to creatures and objects in squares within 5 feet of the targeted intersection, and splash damage to creatures within 10 feet of the targeted intersection. As with a normal splash weapon, you cannot target a grid intersection occupied by a creature.</p><p>Greater splash weapons can be thrown as if they were a rock using the rock throwing universal monster rule (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em> 303), and caught with rock catching (<em>Bestiary</em> 303), though the DC to catch a greater splash weapon is 10 higher than normal due to its fragile and volatile nature. If a creature fails its Reflex saving throw to catch a greater splash weapon, the weapon automatically breaks, treating the creature attempting to catch it as the splash weapon's target.</p><p>A greater splash weapon can be used only by Large or larger creatures, though it can be used as ammunition in a catapult or trebuchet. When used as ammunition in one of these siege engines, use the range for the engine rather than the greater splash weapon's range.</p><h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Pathfinder #91: Battle of Bloodmarch Hills</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
