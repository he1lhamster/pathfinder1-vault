This stone head is set on a plain wooden handle fitted with a bronze hand guard, though closer inspection reveals that the hand guard was likely added some years after the weapon was made.</p><p>Constructed for those whose task was driving back and crushing foreigners seeking to usurp the kingdom of Osirion from its true people, the <em>Blackstone Mace</em> senses anyone within 60 feet who was not born in Osirion, and immediately alerts its owner of all such threats. Unfortunately, the mace is unable to distinguish between foreigners who pose legitimate threats and those with good intentions. Instead, whenever the mace detects someone non-native, it immediately presses its owner to drive that person off—or, if the encounter seems especially dangerous, to kill her. To get the mace to cease its demands, the wielder must succeed at a Will save against the mace's Ego. If the wielder fails this struggle for dominance, his only recourse is to try to convince the mace of the foreigner's innocent intentions.</p><p>Similarly, the mace fails to identify native Osirians who may pose a threat. If used against a native Osirian, the mace refuses to aid its wielder and shuts down its offensive magical properties, instead functioning as a nonmagical masterwork light mace. In order to restore its powers, the wielder must reason with the weapon and convince it that the individual or individuals that were attacked pose a serious threat to Osirion. Not only is the mace prejudiced, it is also arrogant and has the unfortunate quirk of constantly retelling the same stories about how it helped various warriors throughout the centuries achieve their victories. Still, once the mace commits to vanquishing an opponent, it proves relentless in fulfilling its purpose.</p><h2>Crafting requirements</h2><p><strong>Crafting cost: </strong>40600 gp</p>Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Heroic Defiance, <em>break enchantment</em>, <em>stabilize</em><h2>See also</h2><ul class="text_list"><li><a href="1536">Light mace</a></li></ul><h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Pathfinder #83: The Slave Trenches of Hakotep</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
