The listed and cost are for both rings. Creatures wearing <em>rings of bondage</em> can understand one another's speech. The wearer of the master ring gains a +6 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks against the servant and is continuously aware of the location and general condition of the wearer of the servant ring, as the <em>status</em> spell.</p><p>In addition, once per day, the wearer of the master ring of bondage can impose her will upon the wearer of the servant ring, compelling the servant to perform or refrain from an action as if subjected to a <em>lesser geas</em> (Will DC 16 negates). Alternatively, this effect can be executed as a contract between the wearers: as long as the wearer of the master ring is a valid target for <em>lesser geas</em>, she can accept a <em>lesser geas</em> dictated by the wearer of the servant ring. In such an event, neither wearer is entitled to a saving throw and both are compelled by the <em>lesser geas</em> to fulfill the terms of the agreement. If the wearer of the servant ring is unwilling to agree to such a contract, she can always select a <em>lesser geas</em> such as "remove the <em>lesser geas</em> from me."</p><p>As long as a <em>lesser geas</em> imposed by a <em>ring of bondage</em> remains in effect, neither ring can be removed. If either ring is destroyed, the effects of the <em>lesser geas</em> remain in place, but the surviving ring can't create a new <em>lesser geas</em> until the missing ring is repaired or replaced. If a mutual <em>lesser geas</em> is accepted and one <em>lesser geas</em> is ended, both <em>lesser geas</em> effects end simultaneously.</p><p>A target can have a <em>ring of bondage</em> forcibly placed on its finger, but only if that creature is helpless.</p><h2>Crafting requirements</h2><p><strong>Crafting cost: </strong>9100 gp</p>Forge Ring, <em>detect thoughts, lesser geas, sanctuary, share language, status</em><h2>See also</h2><ul class="text_list"><li><a href="2580">Rings of Bondage, Greater</a></li></ul><h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Ultimate Intrigue</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
