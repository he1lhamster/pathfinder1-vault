Any effort to summon a creature requires a successful DC 15 Will save. On a failed save, the user takes 1d4 points of Strength damage and must attempt another save on his next turn. On a successful save, a shadow is summoned. This acts as <em>summon monster IV</em>, except it can be used only to summon a single shadow, and the shadow remains for 1 hour or until destroyed. If the user took Strength damage during the summoning effort, the shadow remains for 1 additional hour per point of Strength lost. Any Strength damage that is restored no longer adds to the duration of the summoned shadow.</p><p>If a user's Strength is reduced to 0 by the <em>nightglass</em> while attempting to summon a shadow, the user is trapped within the <em>nightglass</em> as if by a <em>trap the soul</em> spell, except breaking the <em>nightglass</em> does not free the trapped soul (which can be released only through a <em>miracle</em>, a <em>wish</em>, or similar powerful magic). Additionally, a creature from the Plane of Shadow emerges from the <em>nightglass</em>. This creature takes the form of the user drained to 0 Strength. It uses the same stat block as the trapped soul, but also has the shadow creature template (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</em> 238). The shadow creature has the memories, class levels, and abilities of the user it replaces, but is always of neutral evil alignment. A successful DC 20 Sense Motive check allows anyone familiar with the original character to realize the shadow creature is not actually the person it resembles. The shadow creature is not bound or controlled by the <em>nightglass</em> and has its own dark agenda, but may work with groups able to provide it with security and aid. Should the original user somehow manage to escape the <em>nightglass</em>, the shadow creature replacement is immediately sent back to the Plane of Shadow.</p><p>A <em>nightglass</em> can also be used once per day to communicate with creatures with the evil subtype on other planes of existence. To use a <em>nightglass</em> in this way, the user must know the true name of the creature she is trying to contact. Communication works two ways, and the mirrored surface of the <em>nightglass</em> hazily shows the creature being contacted.</p><h2>Crafting requirements</h2><p><strong>Crafting cost: </strong>63000 gp</p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>shadow conjuration</em>, <em>summon monster IV</em>, <em>trap the soul</em>, creator must be 10th level or higher and must be a worshiper of Zon-Kuthon<h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Lost Treasures</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
