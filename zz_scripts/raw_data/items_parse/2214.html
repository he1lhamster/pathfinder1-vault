At the same time, it creates an effect mimicking <em>reverse gravity</em> upon the water, causing it to shoot up in a geyser capable of reaching a thousand feet high. Moments later, the effect passes; the water comes crashing down, and can be captured or diverted in the process, though the water level of the original supply remains unchanged.</p><p><em>Bath of the God-Kings</em>: Bathing in a pool infested by the Aqualinth instantly refreshes the bather, removing any fatigued or exhausted conditions. In addition, the bather is treated as though he were wearing a <em>ring of sustenance</em> for the next 4 months. Regular bathing for 56 days results in a +1 increase to a single ability score of the bather's choice—a creature can receive this bonus only once, but can continue to receive the other benefits of bathing in the pool.</p><p><em>Liquid Ones</em>: Anyone who spies her own reflection in a pool infested by the <em>Aqualinth</em> and who is not completely loyal to the Four Pharaohs of Ascension is treated as though she had gazed into the reflective surface of a <em>mirror of opposition</em>. The duplicates created by the <em>Aqualinth</em> are not truly identical to their originals. A duplicate has vulnerability to fire, losing any fire resistance or immunity the original may have, and also gains the water subtype. A duplicate can be distinguished from the original with a DC 30 Perception check, as the duplicate has a faint watery texture to its skin.</p><p><em>Whispering Water</em>: Possessed of a malign and alien intellect, the <em>Aqualinth</em> has an unknown agenda of its own, and is capable of casting <em>suggestion</em> (save DC 31) upon anyone who drinks at least half a gallon of water it has touched or produced.</p><h2>Destruction</h2><p>The <em>Aqualinth</em> may be evaporated into nothingness by transporting it to the heart of a sun or star.</p><h2>See also</h2><ul class="text_list"><li><a href="779">Mirror</a></li><li><a href="4987">Mirror of Opposition</a></li><li><a href="2538">Ring of Sustenance</a></li></ul><h2>Tags</h2>Artifact, Evil<h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Lost Cities of Golarion</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
