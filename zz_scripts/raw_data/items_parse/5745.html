Once an eye is grafted into a palm, it is undetectable while closed and doesn't hinder the user's manual dexterity in the slightest. When in use, the eye opens.</p><p>The owner of a <em>third eye</em> can use it to see through the donor creature's remaining eye. The <em>third eye</em> can also be attuned to specially prepared bloodstones, allowing the user to observe things in each bloodstone's vicinity as if the bloodstone were an eye as well. Preparing a bloodstone in this manner requires soaking it in a potion of <em>clairvoyance/clairaudience</em> for a week, at the end of which the owner drinks the potion and spits the bloodstone into the hand bearing the <em>third eye</em>. These bloodstones are often incorporated into magic items like phylacteries, rings, and amulets, allowing the user to gift such items to other creatures and thus gain a new viewpoint. This remote viewing ability functions at any range as long as the owner is on the same plane at the bloodstone. It also allows the owner to cast <em>clairaudience/clairvoyance</em> up to three times per day.</p><p>As long as the <em>third eye</em> is open in a hand that isn't holding an object, the owner has all-round vision, gaining a +4 bonus on Perception checks and making it impossible to flank the owner. Rakshasas, whose fingers bend backwards, can use the powers of their <em>third eyes</em> while holding objects since their <em>third eyes</em> effectively look out of the "backs" of their hands.</p><p>A <em>third eye</em> cannot be transferred between creatures—if removed from the owner's body, a <em>third eye</em> is destroyed. A <em>third eye</em> that remains in the owner's palm but is damaged or otherwise permanently blinded becomes useless until a <em>remove blindness</em> spell is cast upon it.</p><h2>Crafting requirements</h2><p><strong>Crafting cost: </strong>10000 gp</p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>clairvoyance/clairaudience</em>, access to obscure traditions and lore<h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Curse of the Crimson Throne (PFRPG)</li><li>Pathfinder #9: Escape from Old Korvosa</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
