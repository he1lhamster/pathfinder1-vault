Its surface is carved with an intricate pattern of interlocking knots inlaid with silver and copper. When sounded, the horn can drive off or attract dragons of all varieties. Lesser dragons such as drakes typically flee in terror from the sound of the Drakesbane Horn, while more powerful dragons are compelled to seek out the horn. Creatures must be able to hear the horn to be affected by it.</p><p>The <em>Drakesbane Horn</em> affects dragons based on their CR, as detailed below.</p><p>Creatures of the dragon type of CR 5 or less within 400 feet must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be affected as if by <em>scare</em> (no HD limit).</p><p>Creatures of the dragon type of CR 6 to CR 10 within 400 feet must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be affected as if by <em>sympathy</em>.</p><p>Adult or older true dragons and creatures of the dragon type of CR 11 or greater are immune to the horn's effects, though they are likely to seek out the horn and attack its bearer.</p><p>If the character playing the horn has the bardic performance class feature or the raging song class feature and succeeds at a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check, dragons of CR 5 or less are instead affected by fear (Will DC 16), while dragons of CR 6 to CR 10 affected by the horn's <em>sympathy</em> effect must succeed at an additional Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the character's level + the character's Charisma modifier) or also be fascinated for as long as the character continues to play the horn.</p><p>A creature that successfully saves against the horn's effects is immune to further blasts for the next 24 hours. Note that the <em>Drakesbane Horn</em> does not grant the character playing it any ability to communicate with or otherwise control creatures affected by the horn.</p><h2>Destruction</h2><p>The <em>Drakesbane Horn</em> is destroyed if it is soaked in the blood of an ancient dragon and then played by a stone giant elder.</p><h2>Tags</h2>Artifact<h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Pathfinder #93: Forge of the Giant God</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
