For most, this means an excruciating, spellblasted death; for a small fraction of others, this means a typically brief but painful existence as a failed lich; but for an exceedingly rare few, this means something in between. A <em>phylactery of the failed</em> has a minute chance of coming into being anytime a spellcaster attempts to achieve lichdom and fails (equivalent to 1 in 100). In such cases, the magicuser's body is destroyed, but the phylactery he prepared remains and is invested with a remnant of his shattered consciousness. The creature that opens a <em>phylactery of the failed</em> must immediately succeed at a DC 30 Will saving throw or be affected by a disease-like curse known as a parasitic soul (detailed below). Those affected by a parasitic soul have their own personality and sanity overwhelmed by the remnant ambitions and memories of the would-be lich whose destruction created the phylactery. If the cursed creature is killed by the parasitic soul, her body is animated 1 day later as a lich with the same memories and abilities of the magic-user who created the phylactery, essentially allowing that spellcaster to finally achieve lichdom. The cursed creature cannot be returned to life until the lich is destroyed.</p><p>If the parasitic soul is excised from a victim, it returns to the phylactery and attempts to infect the next creature to open the box. The parasitic soul can only infect one creature at a time. While a creature is infected by a parasitic soul, the phylactery the soul is bound to has no dangerous properties and cannot infect other creatures.</p><p>The invasive nature of <em>phylacteries of the failed</em> has spawned the creation of several other pernicious magic items, such as the disease-spreading <em>death's head coffer</em> (see <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #8</em>).</p><p><strong>Parasitic Soul</strong> Curse and disease; <em>save</em> Will DC 30; <em>frequency</em> 1/day; <em>effect</em> 1d6 Intelligence damage; <em>cure</em> a parasitic soul can only be cured by casting both a spell that prevents the target from being mentally controlled (like <em>protection from evil</em>) and <em>remove curse</em>.</p><h2>Destruction</h2><p>Casting <em>resurrection</em> upon a <em>phylactery of the failed</em> restores the would-be lich to life as a living spellcaster with the statistics the magic-user had before attempting the transformation into lichdom. This destroys the phylactery, but brings a powerful evil spellcaster back into being.</p><h2>See also</h2><ul class="text_list"><li><a href="4074">Death's Head Coffer</a></li></ul><h2>Tags</h2>Artifact, Evil<h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Artifacts and Legends</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
