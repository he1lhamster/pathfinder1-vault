Three thin mithral rods extend from a thick plate, emitting invisible, short-range fields that respond to specific movements with notes of different pitches and timbres. Plucking the air between the mithral rods creates a variety of tones that a skilled musician can work into complicated chords and melodies.</p><p>The music of a <em>wave harp</em> is usually thin and high pitched, even when the lower notes are played closest to the plate. A <em>wave harp</em> is generally placed upon a stool or table at waist height to the musician, but it can be fitted with a strap to hang in front of the musician like a marching drum. As the necessary finger-motions are something between playing an organ and a zither, a musician can use either Perform (keyboard) or Perform (strings) to play a <em>wave harp</em>, although a musician without ranks in both skills takes a –4 penalty on his Perform checks.</p><p>There is no limit to the time a <em>wave harp</em> can be played as a mundane instrument, but the device has two additional magical effects that can be activated by anyone playing the <em>wave harp</em> as a standard action three times per day. First, the musician can conjure a pair of ghostly hands made of sonic energy to assist in plucking the air for 1 minute; the hands automatically assist the wearer with Perform checks, providing a +2 bonus on Perform checks with the instrument for 1 minute. These hands also absorb errant noises that would impact the performance, providing the musician with sonic resistance 10. Second, the musician can cause the <em>wave harp</em> to emit a discordant wail. The musician attempts a DC 15 Perform check with the <em>wave harp</em>; on a success, all creatures within 30 feet other than the musician take a –2 penalty on saving throws against sonic effects for 1 round, plus 1 additional round for every 5 points by which the Perform check result exceeds the DC.</p><h2>Crafting requirements</h2><p><strong>Crafting cost: </strong>3750 gp</p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>minor image</em>, <em>sound burst</em><h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Pathfinder #122: Into the Shattered Continent</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
