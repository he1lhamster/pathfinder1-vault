The application of the powder depends on the disease from which it is refined. Someone using powder made from diseases contracted by ingestion must apply it to food (a full-round action) for the victim to consume. Those using powder made from diseases contracted by injury must apply the powder to weapons (a standard action, as per the poison application rules) and deal damage to victims to subject them to the contagion. Diseases contracted by inhalation require the user to disperse the powder by throwing it into the air. Throwing a handful of plague powder is a splash attack with a range increment of 5 feet. Anyone standing in the square of impact must succeed at a save with a DC equal to that of the disease from which the powder is made to avoid contracting the illness, while those in adjacent squares must attempt the same save with a +4 bonus. Diseases spread through contact can use any of the three manners of application.</p><p>The most common disease refined for these powders is filth fever, costing 144 gp, but refined plague powders of other diseases are available, with a price equal to the base save DC of the disease squared. Making a plague powder always requires access to a sample of the disease and exposes the creator to the disease in question each day of crafting. Crafting a dose of plague powder requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.</p><h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Horror Adventures</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
