Each is an intelligent artifact largely in control of itself. A totem radiates an aura that forces all non-worshipers of Angazhan within 30 feet to make a successful DC 15 Will save or become panicked for 1 round. This is a mindaffecting fear effect. A totem can also make use of its own spell-like abilities as it pleases, frequently lashing out with <em>weird</em> to attack. Its size and direct connection to Angazhan's power prevents it from easily being used by other creatures. Any who would employ its powers must touch the totem. Those who aren't chaotic evil worshipers of Angazhan must also enter into a contest of wills with the totem to make use of its powers for that day (see page 535 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>). If a creature wins the contest, that creature can direct the totem to use its abilities. Additionally, the creature is immune to the totem's panic aura for 24 hours and the totem cannot use its spell-like abilities against the creature for that day.</p><h2>Destruction</h2><p>A <em>totem of Angazhan</em> can be destroyed only by a Gorilla King (either acting on his own volition or while under the effects of magical control), who can damage the totem as if it were a normal item with hardness 8 and 100 hit points (or by succeeding at a DC 30 Strength check to break the totem in half). Of course, once a Gorilla King makes his first attack upon one of these totems, the blasphemy against Angazhan causes that Gorilla King to no longer count as a worshiper of Angazhan, and he can now be affected by the totem's panic aura. Worse, the affront allows the <em>totem of Angazhan</em> to attempt once per round to revoke that Gorilla King's reincarnated body. Each round the blasphemous Gorilla King remains within reach of the totem's senses, the Gorilla King must make a successful DC 25 Fortitude save to avoid being transformed back into whatever race the creature was before he was reincarnated. Once this occurs, the target is no longer a Gorilla King and can no longer damage the totem, but the totem can continue to use <em>weird</em> to attempt to slay the creature as long as it is able.</p><h2>Tags</h2>Artifact<h2>Sources</h2><ul class="text_list"><li>Artifacts and Legends</li><li>Pathfinder #42: Sanctum of the Serpent God</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 5rem"><em>See something wrong? <a href="/contact">Tell me</a> and I'll fix it.</em></p></main></div><footer>
