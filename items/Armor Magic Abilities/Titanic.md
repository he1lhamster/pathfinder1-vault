name: "Titanic"
type: ['armor_quality']
price: "+3 bonus"
description: |
  "A suit of armor with the _titanic_ ability is almost comically oversized, though the effect is superficial and the interior fits a creature normally, with no adjustments necessary. A creature wearing _titanic_ armor is considered one size category larger for the purpose of using or being affected by special attacks that depend on size, such as swallow whole and trample. Once per day on command, the wearer can increase her size as if using _enlarge person_ (even if the wearer is not humanoid) for 1 minute. In addition, once per minute as a free action the wearer can add the armor’s enhancement bonus to a single Strength check or combat maneuver check, or to her CMD against a single combat maneuver. Because of its great bulk, the armor check penalty of titanic armor is increased by an amount equal to its enhancement bonus."
