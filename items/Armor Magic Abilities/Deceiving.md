  "A suit of armor with this special ability alters the perceived aura of the wearer for the purpose of divination spells that reveal auras (such as _detect evil_) to an aura decided when the armor is enchanted. The wearer always radiates this alternate alignment aura while wearing a suit of _deceiving_ armor, and cannot suppress this effect. The wearer does not count as having this modified alignment for effects other than detection, such as smite, access to class abilities, and spells that have alternative effects based on a target’s alignment. If the wearer is struck by an attack or effect that is more effective against evil-aligned creatures (such as smite, holy word, etc.), the attacker perceives the strike as being far more effective than it actually is. However, with a successful DC 20 Sense Motive check, the attacker realizes something is amiss with the attack."

### Description

A suit of armor with this special ability alters the perceived aura of the wearer for the purpose of divination spells that reveal auras (such as _detect evil_) to an aura decided when the armor is enchanted. The wearer always radiates this alternate alignment aura while wearing a suit of _deceiving_ armor, and cannot suppress this effect. The wearer does not count as having this modified alignment for effects other than detection, such as smite, access to class abilities, and spells that have alternative effects based on a target’s alignment. If the wearer is struck by an attack or effect that is more effective against evil-aligned creatures (such as smite, holy word, etc.), the attacker perceives the strike as being far more effective than it actually is. However, with a successful DC 20 Sense Motive check, the attacker realizes something is amiss with the attack.

### Construction

**Requirements** Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _nondetection_, _unholy blight_; **Price** +2,500 gp
