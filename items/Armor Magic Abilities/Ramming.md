  "These shields are sturdily built and often bear the device of a ram or bull. When the wielder of a _ramming_ shield makes a shield bash attack as part of a charge, the shield’s enhancement bonus to Armor Class applies to the attack and damage rolls. This doesn’t stack with any existing enhancement the shield has. If the attack hits, as a swift action the wielder can attempt a bull rush combat maneuver against that target, adding the +2 bonus for charging and the shield’s enhancement bonus to the combat maneuver check. Only shields that can make a shield bash attack can have the _ramming_ ability."
