  "Three times per day, the wearer of a suit of _phantasmal_ armor can leave an illusory afterimage of herself in a square she occupied as part of a move action. This double is created through illusion magic from the shadow subschool and is partly real. The illusory double cannot move from its designated square but otherwise reacts and maneuvers as directed by the wearer of a suit of _phantasmal_ armor. The double cannot attack, but it can menace opponents and distract them, and thus counts as an ally for the purpose of determining flanking. The illusory double has an AC equal to 12 + the enhancement bonus of the _phantasmal_ armor. A successful melee or ranged attack against the illusory double (or any damage from an area effect attack) dismisses the effect. The _phantasmal_ special ability can be applied only to light armor."

Three times per day, the wearer of a suit of _phantasmal_ armor can leave an illusory afterimage of herself in a square she occupied as part of a move action. This double is created through illusion magic from the shadow subschool and is partly real. The illusory double cannot move from its designated square but otherwise reacts and maneuvers as directed by the wearer of a suit of _phantasmal_ armor. The double cannot attack, but it can menace opponents and distract them, and thus counts as an ally for the purpose of determining flanking. The illusory double has an AC equal to 12 + the enhancement bonus of the _phantasmal_ armor. A successful melee or ranged attack against the illusory double (or any damage from an area effect attack) dismisses the effect. The _phantasmal_ special ability can be applied only to light armor.
