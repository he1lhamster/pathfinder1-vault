  "_Venom-eating_ armor allows its wearer to store poisons from venomous creatures for later use. Whenever the wearer of _venom-eating_ armor is subjected to a poison attack and succeeds at a saving throw to resist the initial exposure, the _venom-eating_ armor absorbs 1 dose of the poison. At any time after absorbing a dose of poison, the wearer of _venom-eating_ armor can envenom a held weapon with the stored poison as a standard action without risk of poisoning himself. _Venom-eating_ armor can hold a maximum number of poison doses equal to the total enhancement bonus of the _venom-eating_ armor, but all doses must be the same type of poison. If the wearer of a suit of _venom-eating_ armor succeeds at a saving throw against a new type of poison, that poison is stored in the armor and all doses of the old poison are lost. The _venom-eating_ special ability can be applied only to armor made primarily from leather, such as leather, studded leather, and armor made of dragonhide."
