  "When the wearer of _unbowed_ armor would be reduced to 0 hit points or fewer by an attack that deals hit point damage, the wearer can negate all of that attack’s damage as an immediate action. Using this effect permanently destroys the _unbowed_ armor and causes it to explode in a shower of metal shrapnel, dealing 1d6 points of piercing damage per point of armor bonus to AC granted by the armor. This damage affects all creatures within 10 feet of the wearer (but not the wearer herself). A successful DC 20 Reflex save halves this damage. The _unbowed_ special ability can be applied only to heavy armor."
