  "This special ability can be placed only on heavy armor. _Volcanic_ armor is often stony in appearance and gives off a soft red glow. Once per day, the wearer can command the armor to erupt, causing a cloud of smoke and hot molten liquid to shoot forth from the armor in a 5-foot radius centered on the wearer. The smoke provides concealment, and the liquid deals 1d6 points of fire damage and ignites flammable substances. One round after the armor erupts, the smoke clears and the liquid cools and solidifies, creating difficult terrain. The wearer of this armor isn’t affected by the smoke, fire damage, or difficult terrain created by this armor."
