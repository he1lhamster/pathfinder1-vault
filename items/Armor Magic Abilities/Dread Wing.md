  "As an immediate action, the wearer of a suit of _dread wing_ armor can order it to disassemble and reconfigure itself as a pair of immense dragon’s wings. These wings grant the armor’s wearer a fly speed of 60 feet (average maneuverability) and can be used as secondary natural weapons. These bladed wings each deal 1d6 points of damage for a Medium wearer (1d4 points of damage for a Small wearer). The wings are treated as the same kind of material as the base armor for the purpose of penetrating damage reduction. While the wings are unfurled, a suit of _dread wing_ armor’s total armor bonus decreases by half. The _dread wing_ special ability can be applied only to full-plate armor or Hellknight armor."
