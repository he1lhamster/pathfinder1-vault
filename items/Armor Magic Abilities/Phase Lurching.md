  "_Phase lurching_ armor takes on a shifting and immaterial appearance and radiates ghostly clouds of ectoplasm. The wearer of _phase lurching_ armor has the ability to pass through walls or material obstacles once per day as a move action. The wall or obstacle can be up to 5 feet thick, and the wearer moves through it as if it were ethereal. The wearer is not considered ethereal for any other purpose, and can’t move through corporeal creatures or through force effects (such as a _wall of force_) using this ability.
