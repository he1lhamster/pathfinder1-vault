  "A suit of _steaming_ armor features numerous sliding plates and movable pieces to aid in ventilation. Three times per day, the wearer of _steaming_ armor can speak a command word that causes the armor to emit a cloud of scorching steam. The steam lasts for 5 rounds or until the wearer dismisses it by speaking a second command word.
   When the wearer speaks the command word and at the start of the wearer’s turn during subsequent rounds, the steam deals 1d6 points of fire damage to any creature grappling the wearer or occupying the wearer’s square (though not to the wearer) and 1 point of damage to any creature within a 5-footradius burst of the wearer (except for those that have already taken damage because they are grappling the wearer). While the _steaming_ ability is active, a creature that is within 5 feet of the wearer that makes a melee attack or attempts a combat maneuver against the wearer must succeed at a DC 14 Reflex saving throw or take 1d6 points of fire damage.
   The _steaming_ armor special ability can be applied only to medium and heavy armors."
