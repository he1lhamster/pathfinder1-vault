  "Armor and shields with this special ability excel at blocking the attacks of certain types of creatures, similar to a _bane_ weapon’s excelling against certain foes. Against the designated foe, the item’s enhancement bonus to AC is +2 better than its actual bonus and provides DR 2/— against attacks from that foe. This increase in enhancement bonus applies only to the armor or shield’s enhancement bonus, not to temporary bonuses (such as the _magic vestment_ spell). To randomly determine the armor or shield’s designated foe, use the table for the _bane_ weapon special ability (page 136)."
