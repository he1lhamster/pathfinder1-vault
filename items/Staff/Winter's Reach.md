  "This staff is made of a single icicle that tapers to a sharpened point at each end. It can be used as a _+3 icy burst quarterstaff_ (only one end of the staff bears this magical enhancement), even if all of its charges are drained. It allows the use of the following spells and abilities:
  Like a _frost brand_, _Winter's Reach_ extinguishes all nonmagical fires in a 20-foot radius. As a standard action, it can also dispel lasting fire spells, but not instantaneous effects. The bearer must succeed at a dispel check (1d20+19) against each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the caster level of the fire spell. The staff can also be used to counterspell any spell with the fire descriptor as if with _dispel magic_. Dispelling or counterspelling a fire spell in this way uses 1 charge."
