  "This artifact was crafted ages ago, weaving together wispy strands of shadow into a twisted black staff.

However, in bright light (such as that of the sun, but not a torch) or in absolute darkness, the wielder takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and checks. The _Shadowstaff_ also has these powers."
