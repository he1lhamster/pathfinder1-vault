  "Made from a large dragon bone, wrapped in scales and topped with the fearsome image of a dragon, this staff radiates power. Each dragon staff is linked to one type of chromatic dragon: black, blue, green, red, or white. All the spells that can be cast using the staff are tied to that choice. If the wielder uses the staff to cast _form of the dragon II_, she must assume the type linked to the staff.

  In addition to these powers, the wielder of the _dragon staff_ also receives a +2 natural armor bonus to her AC and the ability to make a bite attack as a primary natural weapon. This bite deals 1d8 points of damage if the wielder is Medium. These bonuses are a polymorph effect and are replaced by those gained from casting _form of the dragon II_, or other similar spells."
