  "This twisted and gnarled black oak staff draws upon the formless magic of the Shadow Plane to allow use of the following spells:
  In addition, the staff can further influence _shadow conjuration_ and _shadow evocation_ spells, whether cast from the staff or the wielder's daily allotment of spells, without increasing the spell's level. By expending extra charges, the wielder can increase the shadowy substance used to form such spells by +10% per charge, up to a maximum of +50%. Using the staff for this purpose does not increase the casting time of these spells."
