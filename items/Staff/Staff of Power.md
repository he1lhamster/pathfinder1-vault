Description: |
  "A _staff of power_ is a potent magic item with varied offensive and defensive abilities, carved from magically hardened wood. It is usually topped with a glistening gem or orb that burns from within with a flickering red light. The staff allows the use of the following spells:
  The wielder of a _staff of power_ gains a +2 luck bonus to AC and on saving throws. The staff is also a _+2 quarterstaff_, and its wielder may use it to smite opponents. If 1 charge is expended (a free action), the staff deals double damage (×3 on a critical hit) for 1 round.
  A _staff of power_ can be used for a retributive strike, requiring it to be broken by its wielder. (If this breaking of the staff is purposeful and declared by the wielder, it can be performed as a standard action that does not require the wielder to make a Strength check.) All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30-foot spread. All creatures and objects within 2 squares of the broken staff take an amount of damage equal to 20 × the number of charges in the staff, those 3 or 4 squares away take an amount of damage equal to 15 × the number of charges, and those 5 or 6 squares away take an amount of damage equal to 10 × the number of charges. All those affected can make DC 17 Reflex saves to reduce the damage by half.
  The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane of existence (01–50 on a d%), but if she does not, the explosive release of spell energy instantly destroys her. Only certain items, including the _staff of the magi_ and the _staff of power_, are capable of being used for a retributive strike."
