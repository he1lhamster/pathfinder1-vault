Description: |
  "Lasirro's staff is a variant staff of power (_Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment_ 199) that allows the wielder to cast a wide range of spells.
  _Lasirro's Staff_ is a _+2 quarterstaff_ that grants its wielder a +2 luck bonus to AC and on saving throws. Like a _staff of power_, it can be intentionally broken by its wielder as a retributive strike. Doing so is a standard action. All creatures and objects within 20 feet of the broken staff take 20 points of damage per charge, those within 40 feet take 15 points of damage per charge, and those within 60 feet take 10 points of damage per charge. Anyone affected who succeeds at a DC 17 Reflex save takes only half damage, though the wielder is always destroyed.
  The retributive strike destroys the staff, although it reforms on the anniversary of Lasirro's death 10d10 years later somewhere on the Material Plane within 100 miles of one of Lasirro's descendants."
