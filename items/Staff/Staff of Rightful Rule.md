Description: |
  "This staff is a single piece of mithral carved with lines and small dots and encrusted with blue and violet gemstones at either end. The runes marking it are a mixture of Auran and Infernal terms, intertwined. The staff delivers a _shocking grasp_ (CL 15th) to any creature other than the staff's owner that holds it, and no chaotic creature can become its owner. Asserting ownership requires a successful DC 20 Use Magic Device or Charisma check made while holding the staff. Once a creature becomes the staff's owner, it remains so until another creature asserts ownership.
  A _staff of rightful rule_ has 10 charges when it is created. In addition to the normal method of recharging staves, spent charges from a _staff of rightful rule_ can be restored by casting _dictum_ into the staff. Each casting restores 1 charge, but the staff may never hold more than 10 charges at any one time. The staff allows use of the following spells:"
Destruction: |
  "A _staff of rightful rule_ may be destroyed by a _word of chaos_ targeted at the staff. The caster of the spell must succeed at a DC 30 caster level check to destroy the staff. If the caster fails this check, the staff deals 10d6 points of damage to him."
