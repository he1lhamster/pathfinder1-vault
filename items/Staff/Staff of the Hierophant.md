Description: |
  "The _staff of the hierophant_ is a powerful magic item with the ability to both heal and harm, which also gives its wielder a number of protections. The staff is crafted from platinum and topped with a glowing blue diamond. The staff allows the use of the following spells:
  The wielder of a _staff of the hierophant_ gains a +2 luck bonus to AC and on saving throws. The staff is also a _+2/+2 quarterstaff_, and its wielder may use it to smite opponents. If 1 charge is expended (as a free action), the staff deals double damage (×3 on a critical hit) for 1 round.
  A _staff of the hierophant_ can be used to restore the life of a dead creature by calling upon the wielder's deity to take the staff as a blessing. This causes the staff to vanish, but restores life to any one dead creature as if casting _true resurrection_. In addition, after using this effect, the wielder who triggered it receives a +2 luck bonus on all ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 day."
