Description: |
  "This staff appears as a normal _staff of electricity_, except it is black instead of silver and electricity occasionally arcs along the shaft.

  When the wielder uses the _overcharged staff_ to cast _shocking grasp_, he takes 1d3 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 5d3). When the wielder uses the _overcharged staff_ to cast _lightning bolt_, a random ally takes 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d6); the ally takes half that amount with a successful Reflex save. When the wielder uses the _overcharged staff_ to cast _chain lightning_, for each target the wielder chooses as a primary or secondary target, a random ally must be chosen as a secondary target."
