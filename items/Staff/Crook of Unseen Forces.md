Description: |
  "This iron staff, silvered and inlaid with diamonds, curves at one end like a shepherd's crook. It functions as a _+1/+1 quarterstaff_ and grants an additional +2 bonus on drag and reposition combat maneuvers. However, its true power is to summon and command invisible forces, allowing the use of the following spells.
  Both the _spiritual weapon_ and _spiritual ally_ gain a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage, and any _spiritual weapon_ or _spiritual ally_ created by the crook is invisible as per _greater invisibility_, gaining the usual benefits when attacking creatures are unable to see it.
  The wielder of a _crook of unseen forces_ can spend 1 or more charges as a standard action to create an invisible wave of force in a 30-foot line. This wave of force attempts a drag, reposition, or trip combat maneuver (wielder's choice) against one creature in this line for each charge expended. This special combat maneuver check does not provoke attacks of opportunity and uses the better of the wielder's Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom modifiers in place of his Strength modifier to his CMB."
