Description: |
  "This long, gnarled staff looks like several bones fused together and encased in desiccated, gray skin. It appears as if grown from living flesh and bone, then mummified. At the top of the staff, a clump of sinew clasps a spherical object. When the command word is spoken and two charges are expended, the sinew folds back revealing the petrified eyeball of some mammoth beast. The petrified eye functions in a similar fashion to a _crystal ball_, allowing the user to see events through the eyes of his minions. Drazmorg can use his staff to project his voice from any minion he is currently scrying through, allowing him to usher warnings and threats over great distances, as well as command his spawn. It loses this ability after its charges are consumed.
  In addition, the staff allows the use of the following spells:
  The staff is linked to Drazmorg and the seeping energy of the broken Seal. When Drazmorg dies, the staff bends and twists like a wounded snake, then shudders and becomes inert, its eye open and staring. The petrified eyeball retains some of its power, functioning as an _eye of scrying_, and can be pried or cut out of the "dead" staff without harming its abilities."

This long, gnarled staff looks like several bones fused together and encased in desiccated, _[[monsters/Gray|gray]]_ skin. It appears as if grown from living flesh and bone, then mummified.

When the _[[spells/Command|command]]_ word is spoken and two charges are expended, the sinew folds back revealing the _[[conditions/Petrified|petrified]]_ eyeball of some mammoth beast. The _petrified_ eye functions in a similar fashion to a crystal ball, allowing the user to see events through the eyes of his minions. Drazmorg can use his staff to project his voice from any minion he is currently _[[spells/Scrying|scrying]]_ through, allowing him to usher warnings and threats over great distances, as well as _command_ his spawn. It loses this ability after its charges are consumed.
