Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "5400 gp"
Weight: "3 lbs."
Slot: "Neck"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "faint evocation"
Description: |
  "This ornate pectoral necklace is crafted out of articulated gold plates arranged in the shape of a falcon—the sacred animal of Horus, the Ancient Osirion god of the sun and the sky.
  When outdoors and in an area with direct, natural sunlight, the wearer of a _sun falcon pectoral_ can call down dazzling beams of sunlight from the sky once per day. As a standard action each round for 5 rounds, the wearer can call down a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long vertical sunbeam anywhere within 100 feet. A creature struck by a beam takes 3d6 points of damage and is blinded (a successful DC 14 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the blindness). The wearer does not need to call down a sunbeam each round, but once 5 rounds have passed, no more beams can be called down.
  Indoors, underground, or in areas of darkness, the wearer can instead create a _daylight_ effect from the necklace once per day. The daylight effect lasts up to 2 hours. Whether used to create _daylight_ or sunbeams, a _sun falcon pectoral_ can only be used once per day."
