Description: |
  "These stylized red gloves are often employed by agents of the Red Mantis for stealthy assassinations. If the wearer successfully pins an opponent with a grapple combat maneuver, she can perform a special coup de grace attack the next round with the gloves, treating them as if they were sawtooth sabres (1d8 points of slashing damage, critical threat range of 19–20) for the purpose of this attack. Should the wearer of these gloves slay her opponent with this attack, the target's head erupts in a geyser of blood, preventing life-restoring spells that require an intact body. A creature that survives this coup de grace attack is immune to subsequent attempts from any _mantis embrace_ for 24 hours."
