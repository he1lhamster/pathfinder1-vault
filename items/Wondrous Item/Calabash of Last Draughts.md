Aura: "strong necromancy, strong transmutation"
Description: |
  "An elaborately carved stopper caps this black gourd. It was once a _decanter of endless water_, but the bottle's magic has been warped by the daemon spirit trapped within. The _Calabash of Last Draughts_ can be slung over a creature's chest with its leather strap, and grants a +2 profane bonus to Intelligence when worn. Five times per day, the wearer can unstopper the bottle and splash a creature with the tainted water within as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet. A successful attack deals 1d4 points of Intelligence damage as the waters wipe away a creature's memories and sense of self. A successful DC 18 Will save reduces this Intelligence damage by half. If a target is helpless or willing, the wearer can instead unstopper the calabash and feed the target its tainted waters, either dealing 2d4 points of Intelligence damage or allowing the wearer to change or eliminate the target's memories as per the _modify memory_ spell.
  The _Calabash of Last Draughts_ also erodes an outsider's connection to the physical world. If a possessing creature's Intelligence is reduced to 1 or lower in this way, it is immediately exorcised from its host's body.
  Upon picking up the _Calabash of Last Draughts_, a creature must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or immediately drink from the accursed gourd."
Destruction: |
  "The _Calabash of Last Draughts_ must be filled with water from the Progenitor Wave at the heart of the Sea of No Shadows in Nirvana, then dashed against the shores of the Mere of Broken Angels in Abaddon."
