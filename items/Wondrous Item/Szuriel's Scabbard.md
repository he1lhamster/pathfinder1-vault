  "A single shattered soul gem is located on the tip of this leather-and-ceramic sheath. This scabbard fits only a greatsword, the favored blade of Szuriel, the Horseman of War. Any magical greatsword sheathed in the scabbard for 24 hours gains the _keen_ weapon special ability [this doesn't stack with other methods that increase a weapon's critical threat range). If another blade gains the benefit of the scabbard, the previous blade loses the _keen_ weapon special ability. In addition, if the greatsword has been sheathed in the scabbard for 1 minute, the wielder can invoke Szuriel's name as part of the action to draw the sword, affecting the wielder with the _rage_ spell for 1 minute or until she slays a creature, whichever comes first."
