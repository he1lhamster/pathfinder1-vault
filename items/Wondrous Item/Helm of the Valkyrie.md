Description: |
  "This shining helm glints with the multicolored hues of the aurora, and features wings carved of fine whalebone that sweep back from the temples. While it is in good shape, it shows signs of having seen battle. Once per day the wearer can summon a giant spectral wolf. Treat this as _phantom steed_ cast by a 14th-level caster, but with an AC of 24 (–1 size, +8 natural armor, +7 Dexterity) and 100 hit points. The wolf can persist for up to 24 hours, as long as the creature that summoned it is still wearing the _helm of the valkyrie_. Even though it takes the form of a fierce predator and is more powerful than other _phantom steeds_, the mount is nothing more than mist and can't attack."
