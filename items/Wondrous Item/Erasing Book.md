Description: |
  "Once per day as a standard action, the holder of this ordinary-looking leather-bound book can erase the writing contained within it. However, the holder cannot erase any writing that required a material component cost, such as a _symbol_ spell or a _sepia snake sigil_, with this standard action. An erasing book can be used as a spellbook or a formula book—spells written in the book have a material component cost and are immune to the book's erasing effect. Erasing the book also removes smudges, stains, and minor water damage, but it doesn't recover text lost to serious damage."
