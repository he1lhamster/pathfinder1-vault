Three times per day as an immediate action, the wearer can take a 5-foot step to move into the path of a ranged attack and treat herself as the target of the ranged attack that passes through her square for the purposes of Deflect Arrows, Snatch Arrows, Missile Shield, and other feats and abilities that allow her to deflect ranged attacks. If she lacks a feat or ability that would allow her to deflect the ranged attack, the wearer is instead simply struck by the attack regardless of the attack roll's result or her AC. The wearer can't take a 5-foot step during the turn after using this ability."
