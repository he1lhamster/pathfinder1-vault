Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "8400 gp"
Weight: "0.5 lbs."
Slot: "Hands"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "Each of these leather gloves has a large, ragged hole in the palm. Upon donning the gloves, the wearer is nauseated with pain for 1 round as the skin on his palms rips open, revealing terrible gashes that each sprout fangs, lips, and a tongue. While the wearer's hands are empty, he can breathe, eat, drink, and speak through the mouths on his hands (though this doesn't allow him to drink more potions in a round, speak with more than one voice at a time, or otherwise take more actions than normal). The wearer retains the use of his hands; the mouths remain shut while the wearer is holding items in his hands.
  The wearer receives a +2 enhancement bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple a foe with his hands. If he begins his turn grappling with his hands, the wearer can make a free bite attack with one of the mouths on his hands. The bite is treated as a natural weapon and deals an amount of damage equal to 1d4 + his Strength modifier for a Medium wearer (1d3 + his Strength modifier if he's Small)."
