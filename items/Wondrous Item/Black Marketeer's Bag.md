Description: |
  "This simple leather belt pouch can carry a small amount of ordinary gear and objects, as a normal container of its kind. In addition to this ordinary pouch, a _black marketeer's bag_ contains three separate extradimensional spaces, identical in size and function to the smaller side pouches in a _handy haversack_. Each compartment requires a separate command word to access. A creature that knows the command words can access each hidden compartment without disturbing the contents of the bag itself. A creature opening the _black marketeer's bag_ without first speaking one of the command words sees only the ordinary contents. A _black marketeer's bag_ does not radiate magic (as per _magic aura_).
  When a creature attempts to remove a _black marketeer's bag_ from its bearer without permission, such as with a steal combat maneuver or Sleight of Hand check, the would-be thief must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be compelled to instead place a random item it is holding in its hand (if any) into the bag and then immediately forget the previous round, as per _memory lapse_."
