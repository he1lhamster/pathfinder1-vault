Title: "Music Box Trap"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "20160 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate enchantment"
Description: |
  "A silhouette of a miniature Varisian dancer graces the center of this simple music box. When opened, the music box plays a delicate tune only a few notes long. Although worth 200 gp as a work of art, the music box's true value is as a spell repository. A spellcaster can store a single targeted mind-affecting spell of up to 4th level into a closed _music box trap_ that is not currently storing a spell. Thereafter, when the _music box trap_ is opened and allowed to play for 1 round, the stored spell targets the creature that opened the box. If this would result in the spell being cast at an inappropriate target, or if the creature moves farther than the spell's range away from the music box during the 1-round delay, the spell is discharged with no effect.
  The original spellcaster remains the caster of the stored spell; for example, a _charm person_ spell successfully delivered onto a target from a _music box trap_ makes the creature well disposed to the spellcaster, even if the spellcaster is long gone.
  There is no obvious indicator that the _music box trap_ delivers a stored spell onto the creature opening the box, but while the box is open, those who succeed at a DC 25 Perception check notice that the miniature dancer is keeping her gaze fixed upon the pending target. Closing the _music box trap_ is a move action. If the music box is closed before its stored spell is delivered, the spell remains stored within the _music box trap_ to await the next creature to open the box."

### Description

A silhouette of a miniature Varisian dancer graces the center of this simple music box. When opened, the music box plays a delicate tune only a few notes long. Although worth 200 gp as a work of art, the music box's true value is as a spell repository. A spellcaster can store a single targeted mind-affecting spell of up to 4th level into a closed _[[items/Wondrous Item/Music Box Trap|music box trap]]_ that is not currently storing a spell. Thereafter, when the _music box trap_ is opened and allowed to play for 1 round, the stored spell targets the creature that opened the box. If this would result in the spell being cast at an inappropriate target, or if the creature moves farther than the spell's range away from the music box during the 1-round delay, the spell is discharged with no effect.

The original spellcaster remains the caster of the stored spell; for example, a _[[spells/Charm Person|charm person]]_ spell successfully delivered onto a target from a _music box trap_ makes the creature well disposed to the spellcaster, even if the spellcaster is long gone.

There is no obvious indicator that the _music box trap_ delivers a stored spell onto the creature opening the box, but while the box is open, those who succeed at a DC 25 Perception check notice that the miniature dancer is keeping her _[[universal monster rules/Gaze|gaze]]_ fixed upon the pending target. Closing the _music box trap_ is a move action. If the music box is closed before its stored spell is delivered, the spell remains stored within the _music box trap_ to await the next creature to open the box.
