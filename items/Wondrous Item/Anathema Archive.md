  "This unusually heavy scroll consists of a rather long sheet of supple, impossible-to-tear parchment wound between two rods.

The archive itself can be used for two purposes: to cast ancient spells and to divulge lore about hateful secrets and hidden horrors.
  When using the _anathema archive_ to cast spells, the user can either simply open it (in which case it randomly opens to one of the new Thassilonian spells presented earlier in this chapter) or the user can attempt to force the _anathema archive_ to open to a specific spell from that list or to any arcane spell she knows how to cast. Doing so requires a Spellcraft check (DC = 20 + double spell level)—failure indicates the archive opens to a random spell from this chapter's seven earlier options. Whatever spell the _anathema archive_ is opened to, the user may cast that spell from the scroll as if she were casting a spell from a normal scroll, save that the spell is not consumed from the _anathema archive_ upon being cast.
  When used for research, the _anathema archive_ grants a +10 insight bonus into any one Knowledge check associated with sinister or frightening ancient topics (subject to the GM's discretion—sample subjects include evil outsiders, runelords, Thassilon, Leng, evil religions, or undead). This allows a character to make the Knowledge skill check untrained.
  Each time a character uses the _anathema archive_, her mind becomes increasingly haunted and unhinged. Upon using the archive, the user must make a Will save (DC = 15 + twice the total number of times the user has used the _anathema archive_). Failure results in the user taking 1d4 points of Wisdom drain and becoming confused for a number of rounds equal to 1 + the total number of times she has used the artifact.
  The _anathema archive_ closes automatically each time it is used, and cannot be opened again for 24 hours by any force."

### Description

This unusually heavy scroll consists of a rather long sheet of supple, impossible-to-tear parchment wound between two rods. When the _[[items/Wondrous Item/Anathema Archive|anathema archive]]_ is opened, it presents a tangle of Thassilonian runes to the observer. Each time the scroll is unfurled, the runes are in a different order, the contents of the archive shifting according to the user's state of mind and desires each time it is used. The archive itself can be used for two purposes: to cast ancient spells and to divulge lore about hateful secrets and hidden horrors.
