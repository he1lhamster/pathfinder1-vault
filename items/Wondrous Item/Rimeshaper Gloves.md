  "These sleek gloves bear a faint scaled pattern and shimmer slightly, as if they were covered in ice crystals. While in cold or colder weather (_Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook_ 444), _rimeshaper gloves_ allow the wearer to solidify nearby snow or ice into a light or one-handed weapon of normal quality with a hardness of 2. Creating such a weapon takes the same amount of time that it would take to draw it from a sheath—a move action for most, but faster for a wearer with the Quick Draw feat or a similar ability, for example. These weapons evaporate if left unattended for 1 round; otherwise, they last for 1 minute, after which they melt into pure liquid. Alternatively, as a move action, the wearer can cause actual ice crystals to form over the gloves, causing them to act as masterwork spiked gauntlets that also grant a +2 competence bonus on Climb checks. This effect lasts until it is dismissed as a standard action. Finally, the gloves grant the wearer cold resistance 5."

### Description

These sleek gloves bear a faint scaled pattern and shimmer slightly, as if they were covered in ice crystals. While in cold or colder weather (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444), _[[items/Wondrous Item/Rimeshaper Gloves|rimeshaper gloves]]_ allow the wearer to solidify nearby snow or ice into a light or one-handed weapon of normal quality with a hardness of 2. Creating such a weapon takes the same amount of time that it would take to draw it from a sheath—a move action for most, but faster for a wearer with the _[[feats/Quick Draw|Quick Draw]]_ feat or a similar ability, for example. These weapons evaporate if left unattended for 1 round; otherwise, they last for 1 minute, after which they melt into pure liquid. Alternatively, as a move action, the wearer can cause actual ice crystals to form over the gloves, causing them to act as masterwork spiked gauntlets that also grant a +2 competence bonus on _[[universal monster rules/Climb|Climb]]_ checks. This effect lasts until it is dismissed as a standard action. Finally, the gloves grant the wearer cold _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ 5.
