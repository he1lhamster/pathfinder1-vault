Weight: "–"
Slot: "Neck"
Caster level: "11"
Aura: "moderate enchantment, moderate necromancy"
Description: |
  "This finely wrought iron slave collar is embedded with flecks of pyrite and resembles a stylized rendering of a snake eating its own tail. To function, it must be placed around the neck of a helpless living creature of up to Large size. A creature that speaks the command word while touching the collar can hold the wearer accountable to a single service or course of action (as if affected by _geas/quest_, DC 19) for the next 11 days.
  Instead of the penalties associated with that spell, if the wearer deviates from this action or attempts to remove the collar before the service ends—either directly or by encouraging others to—the collar tightens and begins to choke the wearer into submission (as if affected by _suffocation_). The choking effect ends once the wearer falls unconscious. A _serpentine choker_ can be removed safely if the controlling creature speaks the command word again while touching the collar, or as if it were a cursed item."
