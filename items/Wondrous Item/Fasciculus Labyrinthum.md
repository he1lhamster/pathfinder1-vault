  "The rune of Baphomet emblazons this slim, leather-bound volume. Taken from a larger work, the _Fasciculus Labyrinthum_ details many of the rituals of Baphomet worship. Included in its pages are details of how to operate the _imago lens_ and incomplete instructions to constructing one. As long as the book is carried (even if carried in an extradimensional space like a _bag of holding_), it grants its carrier immunity to _maze_ spells and a +4 profane bonus on all saving throws against insanity and confusion effects."

  "The _Fasciculus Labyrinthum_ must be carried into a maze that has never been solved. The book must remain in the possession of a person lost in the maze for 666 days. If on the 666th day the carrier of the book solves the maze, the pages of the _Fasciculus Labyrinthum_ turn blank and nonmagical."
