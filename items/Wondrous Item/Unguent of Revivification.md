Description: |
  "This foul-smelling gray paste is typically stored in a bone container. When smeared upon a corpse, it preserves that corpse's state of decay for 5 days, as if via the _gentle repose_ spell. If smeared upon a corporeal undead creature, it restores that creature's living appearance for 5 days—this has no effect on the creature's abilities, but does grant it a +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear as a living creature and imparts a –5 penalty on Knowledge (religion) checks to identify what type of undead creature it is. _Unguent of revivification_ is particularly popular in Geb, where many of that nation's movers and shakers view it as a vanity item to mask the hideous truths of their undead flesh."
