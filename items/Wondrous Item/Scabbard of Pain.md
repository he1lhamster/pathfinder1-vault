  "This rugged black leather scabbard is wrapped in jet black chains that allow it to easily be hung from one's belt. A _scabbard of pain_ grants it bearer knowledge of advanced torturing techniques used by depraved cultists of the Midnight Lord. It grows or shrinks to fit any bladed weapon sized for a Medium or Small creature. Three times per day, the bearer can declare that he is attempting to deliver a painful strike with a melee attack. If the attack hits, the opponent must succeed at a DC 11 Fortitude save or be affected by _ray of sickening_. The bearer can expend one use of the scabbard's painful strike as an immediate action to affect himself with the _ray of sickening_ effect and voluntarily fail the saving throw. Doing so allows the bearer to reroll a failed saving throw against a mind-affecting effect."
