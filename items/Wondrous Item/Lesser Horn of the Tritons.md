# Lesser Horn of the Tritons

### Properties

**Type:** Wondrous Item **Price:** 6600 gp **Weight:** 2 lbs. **Slot:** Slotless

##### Magical properties

**Caster level:** 6 **Aura:** faint conjuration

### Description

This iridescent spiraling shell can be blown once per day as a standard action to activate any one of these functions:

* Calm rough waters in a 40-foot radius. This reduces the DCs of Swim checks in the area by 5 (to a minimum of 10). This effect lasts for 5 minutes.
* _[[universal monster rules/Summon|Summon]]_ up to six hippocampi. The creatures appear with bit, bridle, and a riding saddle crafted for aquatic use. They serve willingly and well, entering combat and risking attack unflinchingly if a rider directs them to do so (treat them as combat-trained mounts), though they don't make attacks of their own. These hippocampi serve the PCs for up to 2 hours.
* Create a soothing effect in a 40-foot radius that affects only animals and magical beasts with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2 that also have the aquatic or _[[universal monster rules/Amphibious|amphibious]]_ subtype. This otherwise functions as _[[spells/Calm Animals|calm animals]]_ (Will DC 12 negates).
