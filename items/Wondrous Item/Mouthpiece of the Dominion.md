Title: "Mouthpiece of the Dominion"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "8000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Head"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "faint transmutation"
Description: |
  "The snakelike _mouthpiece of the Dominion_ has a fanged mouth for a "head" and a trachea for a "tail." Though not mobile, the mouthpiece periodically thrashes and bites. As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a _mouthpiece of the Dominion_ can be forced into or pulled out of the throat of a Small or Medium creature that is willing or helpless. Installing or removing a mouthpiece deals 2 points of Constitution damage to the wearer.
  The _mouthpiece of the Dominion_ merges with the wearer's own mouth and throat. The wearer gains a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if the wearer is Small). If the wearer already has a natural bite attack, its damage is increased by one step. In addition, the wearer gains a +1 bonus to the DC of his audible bardic performances and any sonic or language-dependent spells and spell-like abilities he uses.
  Any neh-thalggu within telepathic range of the wearer can speak audibly through the _mouthpiece of the Dominion_. If multiple creatures wish to speak at the same time (either the wearer or one or more neh-thalggus), they must make opposed Charisma checks to determine who controls the mouthpiece each round. When speaking through the mouthpiece, a nehthalggu can have any audible bardic performance or any sonic or language-dependent spell or spell-like ability it uses originate from the wearer instead of itself. These effects have their DC increased by the mouthpiece."
