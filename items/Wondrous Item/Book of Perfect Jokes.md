Additionally, up to three times per day the book can be used to cast _hideous laughter_ (Will DC 13 negates).
  By expending one use of mythic power as a standard action, the book's reader can make a brutal verbal tirade mocking a creature. The target creature is enraged per the _rage_ spell, and all other enemies within 30 feet of the target begin laughing uncontrollably, as _hideous laughter_ (Will DC 14 negates either effect). The book contains only one perfect joke for any given creature, so attempting to use the book on a creature a second time yields no effect."
