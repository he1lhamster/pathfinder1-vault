Description: |
  "This small silver cylinder is no bigger than a pinhead and is engraved with an Elven aphorism that roughly translates to "unhindered flight." A _silver nocking point_ can be attached to the string of any bow or crossbow. When using a weapon equipped with a _silver nocking point_, a character can treat penalties for wind conditions as though they were one step less severe. For example, a character firing a ranged projectile in severe wind conditions would fire at a ranged penalty of –2 instead of –4. Magical wind effects that would normally deflect the projectile (such as _fickle winds_) instead impose only a –8 penalty on the attack roll."
