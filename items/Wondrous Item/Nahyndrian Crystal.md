Aura: "overwhelming conjuration, overwhelming necromancy"
Description: |
  "Normally, when a demon lord is slain while its Abyssal resurrection ability has already been used, its body joins the countless others petrified into the walls of the Rift of Repose. The demon lord Nocticula discovered a method to bypass this, however, and now any demon lord slain by her is instead absorbed into her realm, creating an island in her domain. The demon lord's personality and themes influence the nature of the newly formed isle, but little of its physical form remains save for its ichor. This lifeblood fossilizes deep within the island into _Nahyndrian crystals_.
  The majority of _Nahyndrian crystals_ are flawed, but the most perfect of them retain the mythic power of their demonic source. These _Nahyndrian crystals_ have hardness 30 and 120 hit points, and can be used in the creation of various powerful items.
  _Nahyndrian crystals_ feel cold to the touch, and contact with one can be debilitating. When a creature touches a _Nahyndrian crystal_, it takes 1d4 points of Wisdom drain as flashes of horrific anguish flood the creature's mind (Fortitude DC 25 negates). A creature can only be affected in this way by a _Nahyndrian crystal_ once in a 24-hour period.
  A creature that carries a _Nahyndrian crystal_ on its person (even if the crystal is carried in an extradimensional space, such as a _bag of holding_) gains 2 negative levels; creatures with both the chaotic and evil subtypes only gain 1 negative level in this manner. These negative levels remain as long as the crystal is carried and are removed as soon as the crystal is abandoned. The negative levels from multiple _Nahyndrian crystals_ stack. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way while the crystal is possessed (including via _restoration_ spells). A creature who carries enough _Nahyndrian crystals_ to gain enough negative levels to equal or exceed its Hit Dice immediately dies—a humanoid slain in this manner immediately rises as an advanced bodak.
  A _Nahyndrian crystal_ cannot be teleported. Anyone attempting to use a teleportation effect on a creature carrying a _Nahyndrian crystal_ (including the creature itself) must attempt a DC 30 caster level check. If the caster fails the check, the spell doesn't work and is wasted; otherwise, the spell works normally, but any _Nahyndrian crystals_ carried by the teleporter remain behind, dropping to the ground where the teleporter was previously standing."
Destruction: |
  "A _Nahyndrian crystal_ can be destroyed by physical damage, provided the source can penetrate the crystal's hardness."

### Description

Normally, when a demon lord is slain while its Abyssal _[[spells/Resurrection|resurrection]]_ ability has already been used, its body joins the countless others _[[conditions/Petrified|petrified]]_ into the walls of the Rift of Repose. The demon lord Nocticula discovered a method to bypass this, however, and now any demon lord slain by her is instead absorbed into her realm, creating an island in her domain. The demon lord's personality and themes influence the nature of the newly formed isle, but little of its physical form remains save for its ichor. This lifeblood fossilizes deep within the island into Nahyndrian crystals.

The majority of Nahyndrian crystals are flawed, but the most perfect of them retain the mythic power of their demonic source. These Nahyndrian crystals have hardness 30 and 120 hit points, and can be used in the creation of various powerful items.

Nahyndrian crystals feel cold to the touch, and contact with one can be _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Debilitating|debilitating]]_. When a creature touches a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Nahyndrian Crystal|Nahyndrian crystal]]_, it takes 1d4 points of Wisdom drain as flashes of horrific anguish flood the creature's mind (Fortitude DC 25 negates). A creature can only be affected in this way by a _Nahyndrian crystal_ once in a 24-hour period.

A creature that carries a _Nahyndrian crystal_ on its person (even if the crystal is carried in an extradimensional space, such as a bag of holding) gains 2 negative levels; creatures with both the chaotic and evil subtypes only gain 1 negative level in this manner. These negative levels remain as long as the crystal is carried and are removed as soon as the crystal is abandoned. The negative levels from multiple Nahyndrian crystals stack. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way while the crystal is possessed (including via _[[spells/Restoration|restoration]]_ spells). A creature who carries enough Nahyndrian crystals to gain enough negative levels to equal or exceed its Hit Dice immediately dies—a humanoid slain in this manner immediately rises as an advanced _[[monsters/Bodak|bodak]]_.

A _Nahyndrian crystal_ cannot be teleported. Anyone attempting to use a teleportation effect on a creature carrying a _Nahyndrian crystal_ (including the creature itself) must attempt a DC 30 caster level check. If the caster fails the check, the spell doesn't work and is wasted; otherwise, the spell works normally, but any Nahyndrian crystals carried by the teleporter remain behind, dropping to the ground where the teleporter was previously standing.

### _[[spells/Destruction|Destruction]]_

A _Nahyndrian crystal_ can be destroyed by physical damage, provided the source can penetrate the crystal's hardness.
