Title: "Scavenger's Stone"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "2000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "1"
Aura: "faint transmutation"
Description: |
  "This jagged, egg-shaped stone emits a faint red glow when not in direct sunlight. By rubbing a _scavenger's stone_ against a damaged (but not destroyed) construct or object as a full-round action, you repair 1d6 points of damage to the object or construct. If this brings a broken object's hit points above half its maximum hit points, it loses the broken condition. As a standard action, you can smash a scavenger's stone against a destroyed object or damaged construct. Doing so immediately repairs the object to full functionality or heals a damaged construct of 10d6 points of damage. Destroyed magic items can be repaired in this manner if their caster level is no higher than 3rd—more powerful destroyed magical items cannot be repaired by a _scavenger's stone_. A newly-created _scavenger's stone_ has 50 charges—smashing a stone against an object uses up 10 charges."
