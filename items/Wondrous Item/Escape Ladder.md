Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "4000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "This 10-foot long rope ladder unrolls itself on command, extending upward into the air and magically holding itself in place. The ends of each rope have small loops for tying to another rope, a grappling hook, a piton, or similar fixtures. A second command word makes the ladder roll itself again, pulling itself toward whichever end the speaker is touching. Climbing the ladder is a DC 0 Climb check. The ladder can hold up to 300 pounds if holding itself in the air, or 600 pounds if attached to a sturdy surface.
  A third command word creates an extradimensional space at the top of the ladder that is identical to _rope trick_, except it only holds up to one Medium creature and has a very short duration. When a creature enters the extradimensional space, at the end of the creature's turn the space collapses and the creature is transported as though by _dimension door_ 1d6 × 100 feet away in a random direction to a safe, ground-level location. The ladder remains behind and falls to the ground when this power is used. The third command word may be used once per day."

### Description

This 10-foot long rope _[[items/Mundane/Ladder|ladder]]_ unrolls itself on _[[spells/Command|command]]_, extending upward into the air and magically holding itself in place. The ends of each rope have small loops for tying to another rope, a _[[items/Weapon/Grappling hook|grappling hook]]_, a _[[items/Mundane/Piton|piton]]_, or similar fixtures. A second _command_ word makes the _ladder_ roll itself again, pulling itself toward whichever end the speaker is touching. Climbing the _ladder_ is a DC 0 _[[universal monster rules/Climb|Climb]]_ check. The _ladder_ can hold up to 300 pounds if holding itself in the air, or 600 pounds if attached to a sturdy surface.

A third _command_ word creates an extradimensional space at the top of the _ladder_ that is identical to _[[spells/Rope Trick|rope trick]]_, except it only holds up to one _[[classes/Medium|Medium]]_ creature and has a very short duration. When a creature enters the extradimensional space, at the end of the creature's turn the space collapses and the creature is transported as though by _[[spells/Dimension Door|dimension door]]_ 1d6 × 100 feet away in a random direction to a safe, ground-level location. The _ladder_ remains behind and falls to the ground when this power is used. The third _command_ word may be used once per day.
