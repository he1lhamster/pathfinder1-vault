Description: |
  "This delicate black veil is made of black lace and crepe and affixed to a midnight blue bonnet. When it's donned, amorphous shadows swirl beneath the veil across the wearer's face.
  Whenever an ally within 30 feet of the wearer falls unconscious by taking lethal damage, the _bitter widow's veil_ gains 1 charge. The wearer can expend 1 charge as a standard action to unleash a bereaved scream in a 30-foot cone. Creatures within the area must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or become shaken for 4 minutes. If a creature that brought a humanoid or monstrous humanoid to fewer than 0 hit points within the past 12 hours fails the save, it's dazed for 1 round as it is consumed with sorrow, after which it's subject to the shaken effect.
  As long as the _bitter widow's veil_ has an unspent charge, the wearer can see and hear ethereal creatures as though affected by _see invisibility_. The veil can contain only 1 charge at a time. Unused charges dissipate after 1 hour."
