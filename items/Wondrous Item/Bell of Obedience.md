Description: |
  "The _Bell of Obedience_ is a 4-foot-tall bell cast from high-tin bronze that's capable of transmitting a powerful compulsion to those who hear it. To function, the bell must be suspended from a yoke and sounded either with a mallet or a clapper. All creatures within 1,000 feet of the bell other than the user must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be affected by a compulsion effect (determined by the yoke's composition) for 1 hour.
  <table><tbody><tr><td>Material</td><td>Effect</td></tr><tr><td>Bronze</td><td>_Good hope_</td></tr><tr><td>Iron</td><td>_Rage_</td></tr><tr><td>Oak</td><td>_Calm emotions_</td></tr><tr><td>Stone</td><td>_Crushing despair_</td></tr></tbody></table>
  In most conditions, the bell is audible to a range of 1 mile, though it has no effects on listeners farther than 1,000 feet away. Humanoids with the human subtype are particularly vulnerable to the compulsion effect, and take a –2 penalty on saving throws to resist the effects.
  Normally, the compulsion doesn't impart any special instructions, so those affected by _rage_ might participate in wanton acts of violence, and those affected by _good hope_ might simply become more cheerful. If the user succeeds at a DC 25 Perform (percussion) check when activating the bell, he can transmit simple secondary instructions with the compulsion, such as directing enraged listeners to hate a particular object or inspiring the hopeful to attribute their positive emotions to a particular cause.
  The bell can transmit a compulsion once every 8 hours."
