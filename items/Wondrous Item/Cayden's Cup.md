Aura: "faint conjuration"
Description: |
  "On command, this battered pewter tankard fills with ale perfectly matched to the bearer's taste and desire. Ale poured out the tankard quickly loses its flavor and virtue, becoming common swill within minutes. The tankard prevents most of the ill effects of excessive drinking, such as hangovers and blackouts, as long as it remains in its owner's possession. It also provides a +4 bonus on saving throws against poison.
  Once per hour as a move action, by drinking the contents of the tankard and voicing a toast the imbiber gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, but takes a –2 penalty on Dexterity- and Intelligence-based ability and skill checks. These effects last for 10 minutes. If the tankard is empty, it must be filled prior to drinking. If the imbiber expends one use of mythic power while drinking from the cup, the morale bonus increase to +4, the penalties to –4, and the duration of the tankard's effects to 1 hour."
