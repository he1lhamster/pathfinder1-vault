  "This winged, golden cartouche hangs on a leather thong beaded with semiprecious stones. Normally, a _cartouche of distinctive warding_ functions as a _ring of protection +1_ and allows the wearer to use _shield_ two times per day. Once per day, the wearer can write the name of a specific individual in Ancient Osiriani hieroglyphs on the cartouche (the name must be the person's true name, not an alias, nickname, or title). This causes the cartouche's regular powers to go dormant, but for the next hour the wearer is protected against the inscribed individual in three ways:
  At the end of 1 hour, the inscribed name fades, and the cartouche loses all its powers for 23 hours. Note that the actions of the inscribed individual's allies (including minions or summoned creatures) are not subject to the cartouche's power."

This winged, golden cartouche hangs on a leather thong beaded with semiprecious stones. Normally, a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Cartouche of Distinctive Warding|cartouche of distinctive warding]]_ functions as a _[[items/Ring/Ring of Protection +1|ring of protection +1]]_ and allows the wearer to use _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ two times per day.
