  "When a block of incense is placed inside this censer and ignited, the bearer gains the benefits of a heightened 2nd-level _sanctuary_ spell for as long as the incense burns (1 hour per stick of incense) or until the bearer breaks the effect by attacking. Placing the incense is a move action, and igniting it is a standard action. If _incense of meditation_ is burned instead of normal incense, the _sanctuary_ effect is heightened to 7th level.
  While lighting the censer, the bearer can expend one use of mythic power to grant the benefits of the censer's _sanctuary_ to all allies within a 20-foot-radius emanation of the censer for 10 minutes. Allies who attack break the _sanctuary_ effect only for themselves. The incense extinguishes 1 round after the bearer ceases to use. If _incense of meditation_ is extinguished before 8 hours of burning, the remainder becomes normal incense."
