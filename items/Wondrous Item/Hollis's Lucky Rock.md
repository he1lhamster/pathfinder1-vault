Description: |
  "This _stone of good luck_ is weathered and resembles nothing so much as a hard piece of shale. The stone can cast _good hope_ once per day, and its bearer gains a +2 insight bonus on saving throws against fear effects and effects with the emotion descriptor (_Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic_ 137). The stone is very chatty, making friendly observations about its bearer and offering unsolicited advice about the bearer's current situation. The stone speaks with a slight drawl and uses simple words, but its advice is usually quite sound. Around obvious followers of Zon-Kuthon, the stone is instead silent and shudders slightly."
