Price: "1500 gp"

Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "10"
Aura: "moderate enchantment"
Description: |
  "A _regression mine_ is a nondescript plate of metal that can be armed to deliver a terrible, mind-affecting curse. Arming the mine requires a move action, and deploying it in an adjacent square requires a standard action. An armed _regression mine_ must be deployed within 3 rounds; otherwise, it must be rearmed before it can be deployed.
  Once it has been deployed, a _regression mine_ triggers when any creature enters its space. The triggered mine emits an invisible magical field in a 20-foot-radius burst centered on itself, which lasts for 1 minute before dissipating. Creatures in this field when the mine activates or that enter it while it remains active are confused and take a –4 penalty to their Intelligence scores as long as they remain in the field and for 1 minute thereafter. When a creature with the confused condition from this effect determines its action, it must reroll any result that isn't "attack nearest creature" and take the second result.
  A creature in the field of a _regression mine_ can avoid its effects with a successful DC 15 saving throw, but it must continue attempting saving throws at the same DC each round it remains within the _regression mine's_ field.
  A _regression mine_ is a single-use item; once triggered, the mine is inert and nonmagical. An armed _regression mine_ in the area of another _regression mine's_ active field automatically triggers; therefore, a string of carefully placed mines can be activated in quick succession when only one of them is triggered. An armed or active _regression mine_ can be disabled with a successful DC 30 Disable Device check. Failing the check to disable an armed _regression mine_ by more than 5 immediately triggers it. If an active mine is disabled, its magical field immediately collapses. A _regression mine_ is inherently unstable; a creature that takes damage while carrying an armed _regression mine_ must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw, or the mine immediately activates."

### Description

A _[[items/Wondrous Item/Regression Mine|regression mine]]_ is a nondescript plate of metal that can be armed to deliver a terrible, mind-affecting curse. Arming the mine requires a move action, and deploying it in an adjacent square requires a standard action. An armed _regression mine_ must be deployed within 3 rounds; otherwise, it must be rearmed before it can be deployed.

Once it has been deployed, a _regression mine_ triggers when any creature enters its space. The triggered mine emits an _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ magical field in a 20-foot-radius burst centered on itself, which lasts for 1 minute before dissipating. Creatures in this field when the mine activates or that enter it while it remains active are _[[conditions/Confused|confused]]_ and take a –4 penalty to their Intelligence scores as long as they remain in the field and for 1 minute thereafter. When a creature with the _confused_ condition from this effect determines its action, it must reroll any result that isn't "attack nearest creature" and take the second result.

A creature in the field of a _regression mine_ can avoid its effects with a successful DC 15 saving throw, but it must continue attempting saving throws at the same DC each round it remains within the _regression mine_'s field.

A _regression mine_ is a single-use item; once triggered, the mine is inert and nonmagical. An armed _regression mine_ in the area of another _regression mine_'s active field automatically triggers; therefore, a string of carefully placed mines can be activated in quick succession when only one of them is triggered. An armed or active _regression mine_ can be _[[conditions/Disabled|disabled]]_ with a successful DC 30 Disable Device check. Failing the check to disable an armed _regression mine_ by more than 5 immediately triggers it. If an active mine is _disabled_, its magical field immediately collapses. A _regression mine_ is inherently unstable; a creature that takes damage while carrying an armed _regression mine_ must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw, or the mine immediately activates.
