Title: "Incense of Open Thoughts"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "2800 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate divination"
Description: |
  "While a block of this sweet-scented incense burns, creatures inhaling its fumes become unusually receptive to thought. In still air, the incense's smoke permeates a 40-foot-by-40- foot area to a height of 20 feet. Creatures within that area can communicate telepathically with other creatures in the area. Creatures communicating in this fashion don't need to share a language, but must have an Intelligence of 3 or higher. The openness of mind engendered by the incense also provides a +5 insight bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks against creatures in the area, and imposes a –5 penalty on Bluff and Intimidate checks against such creatures and a –2 penalty on saving throws against mind-affecting effects.
  Moderate wind halves the area of the smoke. Strong wind disperses the incense, rendering it ineffective as long as the wind continues. A single block of incense of _open thoughts_ burns for 1 hour. It can be extinguished and relit, but each use consumes at least 10 minutes of its remaining duration."
