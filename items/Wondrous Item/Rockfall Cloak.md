Any damage from falling or from falling rocks is dealt to the stone shell. If it is destroyed, any remaining damage is transferred to its wearer. A _rockfall cloak_ remains in this stone shell form for 1 hour (or earlier, if the wearer chooses) before crumbling to dust. Once it's used in its stone shell form, a _rockfall cloak_ is destroyed."
