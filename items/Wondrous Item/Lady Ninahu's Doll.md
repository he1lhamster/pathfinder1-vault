Caster level: "10"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "This well-worn doll is 18 inches tall, and its floppy limbs and fine clothing are patched in several places. Pressing the doll's left button-eye causes it to become preternaturally rigid and affix itself in space, as an _immovable rod_. While in this state, the doll has hardness 20. The doll can maintain this state for 1 minute before returning to its usual plush composition; pressing the doll's right eye causes it to return to its original state immediately. Pressing either eye is a move action. _Lady Ninahu's Doll_ has the protection of children as its special purpose and particularly prioritizes the protection of its owner if its owner is a child. _Lady Ninahu's Doll_ does not impose a negative level on an owner who is a child, regardless of the child's alignment.
  _Lady Ninahu's Doll_ is satisfied to lie inert most of the time, watching its owner's environment carefully for threats (Perception +13). The doll rarely attempts to communicate other than to encourage feelings of calm and safety. If danger presents itself, the doll is able to move up to 10 feet under its own power, become immobile as above, or take the aid another action to grant its owner an AC bonus. Once per day, the doll can act as if it had the In Harms Way feat. Aware that its immobility is temporary, the doll empathically urges its owner to escape while it holds the menace at bay. _Lady Ninahu's Doll_ can move under its own power, but only to block a perceived threat."
