Description: |
  "An _infecting spike_ is a large, corroded armor spike. When carefully placed against a suit of armor without armor spikes as a fullround action, an _infecting spike_ attaches itself firmly to the armor, which instantly sprouts _+2 armor spikes_ that immediately inflict the red ache disease on any creature damaged by the spikes (Fortitude DC 15 negates; the onset period does not apply). Any creature that successfully saves against the red ache can't be infected by the armor spikes again for 24 hours. The armor's wearer is immune to red ache and gains a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against other diseases.
  A suit of armor with an _infecting spike_ attached slowly degrades, its joints rusting and seams tearing. Beginning 24 hours after the _infecting spike_ is attached, the armor takes 1d4 points of damage each day. This damage bypasses the armor's hardness, and can be repaired or mended normally.
  Removing an _infecting spike_ requires 1 minute of scraping and twisting before it comes free with a ragged tearing sound. As soon as the _infecting spike_ is removed, the armor gains the broken condition; if it already had the broken condition, the armor is instead reduced to 0 hit points."

### Description

An _[[items/Wondrous Item/Infecting Spike|infecting spike]]_ is a large, corroded armor spike. When carefully placed against a suit of armor without armor spikes as a fullround action, an _infecting spike_ attaches itself firmly to the armor, which instantly sprouts +2 armor spikes that immediately inflict the _[[diseases/Red Ache|red ache]]_ disease on any creature damaged by the spikes (Fortitude DC 15 negates; the onset period does not apply). Any creature that successfully saves against the _red ache_ can't be infected by the armor spikes again for 24 hours. The armor's wearer is immune to _red ache_ and gains a +4 _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ bonus on saving throws against other diseases.

A suit of armor with an _infecting spike_ attached slowly degrades, its joints _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Rusting|rusting]]_ and seams tearing. Beginning 24 hours after the _infecting spike_ is attached, the armor takes 1d4 points of damage each day. This damage bypasses the armor's hardness, and can be repaired or mended normally.

Removing an _infecting spike_ requires 1 minute of scraping and twisting before it comes free with a ragged tearing sound. As soon as the _infecting spike_ is removed, the armor gains the _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ condition; if it already had the _broken_ condition, the armor is instead reduced to 0 hit points.
