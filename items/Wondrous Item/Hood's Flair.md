Description: |
  "These garish tokens usually take the form of a colorful adornment for a weapon; attaching a token takes a full-round action and provokes attacks of opportunity. Once per day, when a token is tied to a ranged weapon or thrown melee weapon that the user is wielding, she can use that token's ability, as described below. If the bearer has a grit or panache pool, she can spend grit or panache points to gain one additional use per point spent. A character can benefit from only one token at a time; securing a second token to a weapon provides no additional effects. There are four types of tokens, each offering a different benefit.
  **Black Feather**: As a swift action when she takes a 5-foot step, the user can move an additional 5 feet, for a total of 10 feet. This additional movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.
  **Brass Leaf**: When the wielder user this token as a swift action, her allies don't provide cover against her ranged attacks until the end of her turn.
  **Silver Chime**: When the user misses with a ranged attack because of concealment, as a swift action she can reroll her miss chance percentile roll to see whether she actually hits.
  **Teal Bead**: While making a ranged attack, the user doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity."
