  "This faintly glowing bowstring is twined from the hair of a lillend. When strung on a bow, a _tuned bowstring_ also functions as a masterwork stringed instrument, granting the wielder an enhancement bonus on Performance (string) checks equal to the bow's enhancement bonus (if any). A _tuned bowstring_ produces a perfect note with every arrow fired by its wielder, allowing a character with the bardic performance class feature to maintain a performance in combat without expending rounds of bardic performance as long as she fires at least one arrow each round. Activating a bardic performance or switching to a different performance still costs a round of bardic performance."
