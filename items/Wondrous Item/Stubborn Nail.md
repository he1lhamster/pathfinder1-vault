  "This adamantine piton is 6 inches long. As a standard action, the bearer may push the nail by hand into any non-living material, including metal, stone, or wood. The bearer may push it through more than one item at a time, so long as the total thickness is not greater than the length of the nail. Once pushed into place, the nail is held firmly as if it had been hammered there (a DC 20 Strength check to remove it), although the creature who put it there can remove it as a move action. Once removed, the nail leaves no hole or other sign of its presence. The nail can support 500 pounds. If used to hold a door shut, increase the break DC of the door by +2. If pressed into a lock, the lock cannot be opened until the nail is removed. Once removed, the nail loses all its powers and transforms into a nonmagical iron piton."
