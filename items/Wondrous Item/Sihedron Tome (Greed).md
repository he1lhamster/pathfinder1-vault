Description: |
  "The first _Sihedron Tomes_ were said to have been crafted by a dragon in the service of Emperor Xin. Each of these books has a unique appearance, and hold an infinite number of pages for spellcasters to inscribe spells upon. Any wizard who prepares spells from a _Sihedron Tome_, which potentially holds libraries worth of arcane knowledge, may prepare bonus spells as if her Intelligence were 6 points higher. This is not an actual bonus to Intelligence and grants the user no additional benefit. Karzoug's _Sihedron Tome_ contains all sorcerer/wizard spells (save for those of the schools of Enchantment and Illusion) found in the _Core Rulebook_ and this book—at the GM's discretion, it can certainly hold more spells."
Destruction: |
  "A special 9th-level spell must be designed that exists only to destroy the specific and particular _Sihedron Tome_ into which it is inscribed. This spell, which has numerous expensive and rare material components, must then be cast on the _Sihedron Tome_ by its owner."
