Description: |
  "This battered, leather-bound book looks like an aged and heavily worn notebook. Anyone reading the journal for an hour or more has strange dreams the following night, the details of which he cannot remember. The following day the character is fatigued. Reading the journal for a total of 24 hours or more causes the reader to have a prophetic dream wherein he sees his own death—though, as before, he cannot remember the details. If a character who has had this vision comes near death at any point afterward, at the moment he is about to die he may reroll any failed saving throw made within the last round or force an opponent to reroll a killing attack. The character must accept the result of the second roll, regardless of its outcome.
  Once a character has had the opportunity to avert death, regardless of its success or failure, the journal provides no more benefit and never aids the character again.
  The _Dream Journal of the Pallid Seer_ is affected by a permanent _magic aura_ that makes it appear to be nonmagical."
