  "This macabre pin attaches to one's cloak. Tar-Baphon is said to have gifted these brooches to highly favored but still untrusted minions. When worn, a _tyrant's mark_ provides a +3 deflection bonus to AC and a +3 resistance bonus on saving throws. As a free action after failing a saving throw, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to reduce any damage resulting from the failed save by half.
  When a _tyrant's mark_ is created, it is keyed to a matching black diamond worth no less than 1,000 gp. The creator of a _tyrant's mark_ can expend two uses of mythic power at any distance to use _scrying_ (as the spell) on the pin's wearer while gazing through the black diamond, with the pin acting as the scrying sensor. The wearer of the _tyrant's mark_ takes a –10 penalty on the Will save against the _scrying_ effect, as though the maker had possession of a portion of the wearer's body."
