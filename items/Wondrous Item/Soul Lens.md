Weight: "8 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "20"
Aura: "strong necromancy"
Description: |
  "This large lens of green crystal has the Thassilonian rune for transmutation and greed inscribed upon its surface. The lens is fitted in an iron ring, which is attached to an articulated arm that allows the lens's position to be adjusted to any angle and configuration. The _soul lens_ has but a single purpose—whenever a creature is subjected to a specific ritual in which its body is branded, tattooed, or otherwise marked with the Sihedron rune, the lens can focus upon that creature's soul. At any point thereafter when the marked creature dies, its soul passes through this lens on its way into the afterlife and eventual judgement before Pharasma—as the soul passes through, the soul lens filters elements of the sin of greed from the soul and focuses that fragment of soul-energy into the _runewell of greed_. This does not significantly damage the soul (although it does cause it a severe amount of spiritual anguish)—a creature that dies and has its soul filtered through the _soul lens_ can still be brought back to life as normal."
Destruction: |
  "A _dominant weapon_ must be used to smash the _soul lens_. The _soul lens_ has hardness 20 (this hardness cannot be bypassed) and 200 hit points, but the _dominant weapon_ gains the full benefits of its _bane_ special abilities when damaging the _soul lens_. The _soul lens_ takes no damage from other attacks."
