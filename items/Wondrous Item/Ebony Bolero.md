### Description

Wisps of black smoke dance above these _[[monsters/Gray|gray]]_, fetchling-made pauldrons. The wearer can manipulate these strands of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|shadow]]_ matter, assailing a target within 60 feet as a move action to create any of the effects listed below. All sustained effects last as long as the wearer concentrates to maintain them or up to 1 minute. The effects of these shadowy tendrils can be ignored with a successful DC 16 Will save. An _[[items/Wondrous Item/Ebony Bolero|ebony bolero]]_ has 5 charges, which _[[spells/Regenerate|regenerate]]_ at dusk each day. Each of the following assaults uses 1 charge.

* **Emotion**: The wearer can _[[universal monster rules/Smother|smother]]_ a target's emotions as if by a _[[spells/Calm Emotions|calm emotions]]_ spell. Alternatively, the wearer can force a creature with the _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ class ability to enter a raging state for at least 1 round (though the target can remain in this state longer if it chooses). The wearer can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ 2 charges when using this ability to increase the duration the target must _rage_ to 3 rounds.
* **Memory**: The wearer can _[[spells/Blot|blot]]_ out the target's memories of events from the past minute. This functions as _[[spells/Modify Memory|modify memory]]_, but can only eliminate memories.
* **Thoughts**: The wearer can delve into a target's mind and pluck out thoughts, as per _[[spells/Detect Thoughts|detect thoughts]]_.
* **_[[spells/Vision|Vision]]_**: The wearer can wind wisps of _shadow_ matter around a creature's eyes, _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Blinding|blinding]]_ it for as long as the wearer concentrates. _[[spells/Darkvision|Darkvision]]_ can't penetrate this supernatural _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_, but the _[[universal monster rules/See in Darkness|see in darkness]]_ universal monster ability can.
