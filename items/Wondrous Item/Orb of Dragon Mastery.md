Title: "Orb of Dragon Mastery"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "–"
Weight: "4 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "20"
Aura: "strong enchantment"
Description: |
  "These grim orbs swirl hypnotically with shades of crimson and the color of the draconic breed whose minds they can ensnare. The bearer of an _Orb of Dragon Mastery_ can, as a standard action, dominate dragons of the orb's particular variety within 250 feet (as _dominate monster_), the target dragon being forced to make a DC 23 Will save to resist. Spell resistance is not useful against this effect. By steeping the orb for 1 hour in the blood of a true dragon that has been dead for no more than a day, the DC to resist the orb's _dominate monster_ effect can be increased by an amount equal to the slain dragon's age category. (Thus, steeping the orb in the blood of an old dragon would increase the DC by +8.) This bonus decreases by –1 every day until the orb returns to its normal DC or is again steeped in a dragon's blood. An _Orb of Dragon Mastery_ cannot be steeped in the blood of multiple dragons for an increased benefit. The blood may come from any breed of true dragon, not just dragons of the orb's color."
Destruction: |
  "A dragon of the color the _Orb of Dragon Mastery_ controls must willingly swallow the orb, an act that kills the dragon but also shatters the artifact."
