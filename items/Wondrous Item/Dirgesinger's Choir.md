Price: "34000 gp"
Weight: "3 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "13"
Aura: "strong necromancy"
Description: |
  "Equal parts grisly and lovely, this unusual harp-like musical instrument is crafted from a corpse, with a bone frame, skin stretched around the soundbox for percussion, and strings of twisted hair. When played, it can summon forth a soul bound to it. Initially, the soul is that of the person whose corpse was used to make the instrument. The spirit manifests in an adjacent square as a translucent, intangible image of the person as he was in life. The image cannot attack or be attacked in any way. It is clearly distressed by the musician's playing; it wails an eerie, pained accompaniment that nonetheless enhances the music's quality, granting a +4 circumstance bonus on Performance checks made with the instrument and (if the performer is a bard) adding 1 to the DC of a dirge of doom, frightening tune, or deadly performance played on the instrument.
  If an undead is within 30 feet, the musician can command the bound soul to seize it as a standard action. The undead must attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it's successful, the image dissipates for 1 day; if it fails, the soul rides the undead for 1d4+1 rounds, acting as _control undead_ cast by the musician. If the musician has the bardic performance ability, she can continue playing and spend a round of bardic performance as a free action each round to prevent that round from counting toward the duration of this effect. The soul dissipates for 1 day after the effect ends.
  Crafting the instrument destroys the original body; that creature cannot be brought back to life via _raise dead_. As long as the instrument exists, _resurrection_ and _true resurrection_ can revive the creature only if they're cast on the instrument itself; doing so destroys the instrument. The instrument cannot be affected by spells that target corpses, such as _animate dead_ or _decompose corpse_."

### Description

Equal parts grisly and lovely, this unusual harp-like musical instrument is crafted from a corpse, with a bone frame, skin stretched around the soundbox for percussion, and strings of twisted hair. When played, it can _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ forth a soul bound to it. Initially, the soul is that of the person whose corpse was used to make the instrument. The spirit manifests in an adjacent square as a translucent, intangible image of the person as he was in life. The image cannot attack or be attacked in any way. It is clearly distressed by the musician's playing; it wails an eerie, pained accompaniment that nonetheless enhances the music's quality, granting a +4 circumstance bonus on Performance checks made with the instrument and (if the performer is a _[[classes/Bard|bard]]_) adding 1 to the DC of a dirge of _[[spells/Doom|doom]]_, frightening tune, or _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ performance played on the instrument.

If an undead is within 30 feet, the musician can _[[spells/Command|command]]_ the bound soul to seize it as a standard action. The undead must attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it's successful, the image dissipates for 1 day; if it fails, the soul rides the undead for 1d4+1 rounds, acting as _[[spells/Control Undead|control undead]]_ cast by the musician. If the musician has the bardic performance ability, she can continue playing and spend a round of bardic performance as a free action each round to prevent that round from counting toward the duration of this effect. The soul dissipates for 1 day after the effect ends.

Crafting the instrument destroys the original body; that creature cannot be brought back to life via _[[spells/Raise Dead|raise dead]]_. As long as the instrument exists, _[[spells/Resurrection|resurrection]]_ and _[[spells/True Resurrection|true resurrection]]_ can revive the creature only if they're cast on the instrument itself; doing so destroys the instrument. The instrument cannot be affected by spells that target corpses, such as _[[spells/Animate Dead|animate dead]]_ or _[[spells/Decompose Corpse|decompose corpse]]_.
