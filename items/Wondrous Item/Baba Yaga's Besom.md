Description: |
  "The handle of this simple straw broom, or besom, is capped with a small skull with long white hair. On command, the broom sweeps away any tracks or traces of passage, as _pass without trace_, and wards its user with _nondetection_. The broom can be used in this capacity for a total of 8 hours each day. By sweeping the broom in a circular motion, the user can also learn the location of both secret doors and simple natural traps at will, as _detect secret doors_ and _detect snares and pits_.
  _Baba Yaga's besom_ can also be used up to three times per day to open locks, doors, lids, shackles, chains, and the like by knocking it against the item to be opened. The wielder must succeed at a caster level check using the broom's caster level of 20th, with a DC equal to the Disable Device DC of the lock or binding. Each knock opens only one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, locked, and under an _arcane lock_, it takes all three uses of the broom to open it. The broom automatically dispels a _hold portal_ spell or _arcane lock_ with a caster level lower than 20th.
  Lastly, _Baba Yaga's besom_ can be used as a weapon, functioning as a _+4 dancing club_. On a successful attack, a creature struck by the broom is blinded for 1 round.
  The broom may have other powers known only to Baba Yaga."
Destruction: |
  "_Baba Yaga's besom_ falls into pieces and is destroyed if it is used to sweep all of the rooms in all configurations of Baba Yaga's _Dancing Hut_ within a 24-hour period."
