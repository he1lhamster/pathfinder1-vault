Price: "10000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Neck"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "Although it appears to be a simple thong of leather, this collar was initially conceived by druids who believed that there were animals who possessed spirits worthy of elevation to true sentience. If worn by a creature of the animal type with an Intelligence less than 3, a _collar of the true companion_ grants a +2 enhancement bonus to Intelligence. This does not give the animal the ability to speak, but it does allow it to understand one spoken language (chosen by the item's creator).
  If the collar is worn for at least 1 week by a creature of the animal type, the creature is raised to humanlike sentience, as though by the _awaken_ spell. Once this occurs, the collar loses its magical properties.
  If a _collar of the true companion_ is worn for more than 1 week by a creature not of the animal type, the wearer is _feebleminded_ until the collar is removed."

Although it appears to be a simple thong of leather, this collar was initially conceived by druids who believed that there were animals who possessed spirits worthy of elevation to true sentience.
