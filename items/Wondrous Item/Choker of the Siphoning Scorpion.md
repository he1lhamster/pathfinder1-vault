Title: "Choker of the Siphoning Scorpion"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "8000 gp"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Neck"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate necromancy"
Description: |
  "This choker consists of a thin gold chain with a small scorpion charm that presses snugly against the neck when worn. Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer of this item can forgo her saving throw against a poison effect, and instead let the scorpion charm siphon the poison, filling to its maximum capacity of 1 dose. The wearer suffers no effects from the poison in this manner. While filled, the charm doesn't protect against poison.
  As a full-round action, the wearer can remove the choker and affix it to her melee weapon by pressing the scorpion against the weapon and allowing the chain to automatically secure itself around the weapon's hilt or handle. If the weapon hits, the wearer can choose to dose the target with the poison (in addition to any effects the attack would normally have) as though the weapon were coated with a dose of the poison. This drains the scorpion of its stored dose. The target can attempt a Fortitude save as normal (using the poison's original DC) to resist the effect."
