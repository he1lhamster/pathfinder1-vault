Description: |
  "This walrus-shaped charm is typically carved from ivory or bone. When targeted by a witch's hex or an effect with the curse descriptor, the wearer can activate this charm as an immediate action to gain a +3 resistance bonus on the saving throw to resist the curse effect. If the wearer is affected by the curse effect, he gains a +2 bonus on any subsequent saving throws to resist the effect for up to 1 week, and he gains a +3 bonus on any caster level checks he attempts to remove the effect (such as with _remove curse_) during this time.
  This charm can only be used once, after which the charm's magic is gone forever. A charm occupies the wearer's shoulders or neck slot, though it can share that slot with one other magic item (as a cloak pin or token hanging from a necklace, for example). A character can never wear more than one charm at a time."
