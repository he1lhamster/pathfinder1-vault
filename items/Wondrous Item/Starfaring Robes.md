Description: |
  "This simple blue robe appears plain during the day but sparkles in starlight or moonlight. The wearer is constantly protected as if wearing a _necklace of adaptation_. On command, the robe sprouts pale moth wings, allowing the wearer to fly as if using _wings of flying_. In the vacuum of space, the wearer can fly at an incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system normally takes 3d20 months, while a trip beyond should take 3d20 years (or more, at the GM's discretion), provided the wearer knows the way to its destination. While flying in this fashion, the wearer can enter a state of hibernation (similar to _temporal stasis_), waking instantly if attacked, upon reaching his destination, or after a set time period (such as a month or year)."
