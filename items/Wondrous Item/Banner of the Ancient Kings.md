Title: "Banner of the Ancient Kings"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "18000 gp"
Weight: "5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "8"
Aura: "moderate abjuration"
Description: |
  "This tattered white canvas banner looks like an old piece of sailcloth, or perhaps a winding shroud—a 4-foot-by-6-foot rectangle with loops that can fit over a spear haft or pole running up one side. If mounted on a longspear or pole at least 8 feet in length, the banner shifts in appearance to match the heraldry or coat of arms of the person who attached it. If that person has no device, the flag instead displays a device that echoes the owner's personality (such as a favorite animal, favored weapon, or holy symbol of the wielder's deity).
  When carried into battle, a _banner of the ancient kings_ confers several benefits. As long as the longspear or pole to which the banner is attached is firmly wielded in two hands, its carrier gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Initiative checks. In addition, when so wielded, it grants the wielder and all allies within 30 feet a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects. If the carrier of the banner fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, he may attempt a new saving throw against that effect every round he continues to wield the _banner of the ancient kings_ — once he releases his firm grip on the banner's haft, though, he no longer gets this benefit, even if he wields the banner properly at a later point while still under the effects of the mind-affecting effect.
  If the banner's carrier possesses the Flagbearer feat (_Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide_ 286), the banner of the ancient kings doubles the morale bonuses granted by that feat. A bard who carries a longspear or pole to which a _banner of the ancient kings_ has been attached is treated as four levels higher than his actual bard level for the purposes of determining the bonuses granted by his inspire courage bardic performance ability."

### Description

This tattered white canvas _[[items/Mundane/Banner|banner]]_ looks like an old piece of sailcloth, or perhaps a winding shroud—a 4-foot-by-6-foot rectangle with loops that can fit over a _[[items/Weapon/Spear|spear]]_ haft or _[[items/Mundane/Pole|pole]]_ running up one side. If mounted on a _[[items/Weapon/Longspear|longspear]]_ or _pole_ at least 8 feet in length, the _banner_ shifts in appearance to match the heraldry or coat of arms of the person who attached it. If that person has no device, the _[[items/Mundane/Flag|flag]]_ instead displays a device that echoes the owner's personality (such as a favorite animal, favored weapon, or holy symbol of the wielder's deity).

When carried into battle, a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Banner of the Ancient Kings|banner of the ancient kings]]_ confers several benefits. As long as the _longspear_ or _pole_ to which the _banner_ is attached is firmly wielded in two hands, its carrier gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Initiative checks. In addition, when so wielded, it grants the wielder and all allies within 30 feet a +2 _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects. If the carrier of the _banner_ fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, he may attempt a new saving throw against that effect every round he continues to wield the _banner of the ancient kings_ — once he releases his firm grip on the _banner_'s haft, though, he no longer gets this benefit, even if he wields the _banner_ properly at a later point while still under the effects of the mind-affecting effect.

If the _banner_'s carrier possesses the _[[feats/Flagbearer|Flagbearer]]_ feat (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 286), the _banner of the ancient kings_ doubles the morale bonuses granted by that feat. A _[[classes/Bard|bard]]_ who carries a _longspear_ or _pole_ to which a _banner of the ancient kings_ has been attached is treated as four levels higher than his actual _bard_ level for the purposes of determining the bonuses granted by his inspire courage bardic performance ability.
