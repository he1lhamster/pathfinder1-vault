Title: "Helm of Ooze"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "21500 gp"
Weight: "3 lbs."
Slot: "Head"
Caster level: "10"
Aura: "moderate enchantment"
Description: |
  "This bulky, rusted helm incorporates a pair of goggles that sit on the wearer's brow. The wearer of a _helm of ooze control_ gains a limited ability to telepathically command oozes. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can attempt to gain control over a single ooze within 60 feet. The ooze must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or fall under the wearer's mental control. This compulsion affects even mindless oozes. The control offered by the helm is very limited, and the wearer is able to issue only one of the following commands at a time, as a move action, to a controlled ooze within 60 feet.
  _Attack_: The ooze attacks the nearest creature.
  _Halt_: The ooze remains in place. It does not take any actions but is not considered helpless.
  _Move_: The ooze moves toward a point in space that the wearer can see.
  The wearer can control up to 20 Hit Dice worth of oozes at any given time. An ooze with 5 or more Hit Dice can attempt a new Will save each day to free itself from the wearer's control. An ooze ordered to halt receives a new Will save to overcome the helm's control if attacked. Oozes with an Intelligence score, as well as those with 11 or more Hit Dice, are immune to this effect.
  The wearer can issue a command to multiple controlled oozes with a single move action, but if she does, each ooze receives the same command. Oozes that have been issued a command continue to follow that command until a new command is issued or they are released from the helm's control. Removing the helm does not release the oozes from control, but the helm must be worn to issue new commands. If 24 hours pass without the helm being worn, then all affected oozes are released from control."

### Description

This bulky, rusted helm incorporates a pair of goggles that sit on the wearer's brow. The wearer of a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Helm of Ooze|helm of ooze]]_ control gains a limited ability to telepathically _[[spells/Command|command]]_ oozes. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can attempt to gain control over a single ooze within 60 feet. The ooze must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or fall under the wearer's mental control. This compulsion affects even mindless oozes. The control offered by the helm is very limited, and the wearer is able to issue only one of the following commands at a time, as a move action, to a controlled ooze within 60 feet.

Attack: The ooze attacks the nearest creature.

Halt: The ooze remains in place. It does not take any actions but is not considered _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_.

Move: The ooze moves toward a point in space that the wearer can see.

The wearer can control up to 20 Hit Dice worth of oozes at any given time. An ooze with 5 or more Hit Dice can attempt a new Will save each day to free itself from the wearer's control. An ooze ordered to halt receives a new Will save to overcome the helm's control if attacked. Oozes with an Intelligence score, as well as those with 11 or more Hit Dice, are immune to this effect.

The wearer can issue a _command_ to multiple controlled oozes with a single move action, but if she does, each ooze receives the same _command_. Oozes that have been issued a _command_ continue to follow that _command_ until a new _command_ is issued or they are released from the helm's control. Removing the helm does not release the oozes from control, but the helm must be worn to issue new commands. If 24 hours pass without the helm being worn, then all affected oozes are released from control.
