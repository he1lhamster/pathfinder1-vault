Title: "Throne of Ydersius Ascendant"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "–"
Weight: "2000 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "18"
Aura: "strong abjuration"
Description: |
  "This huge, ornate throne, carved from white marble and inlaid with flickering, smoking, multicolored spirals of serpentstone, is uncomfortably tall and thin for most humans, as it is designed to seat a high priest of the serpentfolk. While seated upon the throne, a divine caster who worships Ydersius may use a spell slot or exchange any prepared divine spell (including domain spells) of 3rd level or higher to cast _dispel magic_. Once per day, a divine caster of sufficient level may instead cast _greater dispel magic_ in place of a spell of 6th level or higher. This ability is in most other ways identical to the spontaneous casting of clerics and druids (see the _Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook_), but may also be employed by antipaladins, inquisitors, oracles, or other divine casters faithful to Ydersius. The throne bestows one permanent negative level on any creature that sits upon it, other than divine casters who worship Ydersius. This negative level remains as long as the non-sentient or heretical creature sits upon the throne and disappears when the throne is vacated. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by _restoration_ spells) while the throne is occupied."
Destruction: |
  "The _Throne of Ydersius Ascendant_ can only be destroyed by anointing it with the blood of Ydersius, followed by a successful _mage's disjunction_ spell cast on the throne by a cleric of an Azlanti deity."
