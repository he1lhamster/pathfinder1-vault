Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate illusion"
Description: |
  "This complex wind instrument is made of interwoven, gilded pipes. It is considered a masterwork musical instrument, granting a +2 bonus on all Perform (wind instrument) checks. The bonus is also added to the DC of any bardic performances made using the _entwined syrinx_.
  Anytime anyone attempts to play the _entwined syrinx_, however, he must make a DC 15 Will save or be compelled to play a dirge of somber beauty. The dirge acts like the fascinate bardic performance— even if the character is not a bard or cannot use Perform (wind instrument)—affecting every creature within 90 feet able to see and hear the character, including the musician playing the _entwined syrinx_. The DC to resist this effect is 12 + the character's Charisma modifier (though if it is being played by a bard, the DC increases to include 1/2 the bard's level; the +2 Perform bonus is included). This effect persists and the musician continues to play for 1 hour, or until the performance is interrupted."
