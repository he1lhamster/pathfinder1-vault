Description: |
  "This elegant, long-necked samisen is crafted of cat skin stretched over a wooden frame. The samisen's three silken strings are magically keyed to the past, present, and future. A user must succeed at a DC 20 Perform (string instruments) check to play the correct tune and cast one of the following spell effects: _legend lore_ (using the string of the past), _scrying_ (using the string of the present), or _divination_ (using the string of the future). Each tune can be performed once per day, and the user must play the samisen for the required casting time of the spell effect. In the case of _legend lore_, if the required casting time is 1 or more days, the user needs to play for just 1 hour. As a masterwork samisen, the _samisen of oracular vision_ provides a +2 circumstance bonus on all Perform checks using the instrument (including Perform checks to use its abilities)."
