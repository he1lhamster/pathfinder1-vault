  The transformation can be ended prematurely by _remove curse_ — _dispel magic_ has no effect. However, when the effect ends, the drinker's head immediately returns to normal.

The drinker knows when the elixir's effects will end 1 minute before they do so (no earlier). If the drinker's body is harmed or destroyed while its head is elsewhere, it takes that damage as soon as it reunites with its body, or is slain if its body has been destroyed. Until the elixir's duration ends, the drinker can only reattach its head to its body through the use of _remove curse_. The drinker's body is considered helpless while the head is unattached."

### Description

When a humanoid imbibes this foul-tasting green fluid, its ears grow to 10 times their size, and its head separates from its body. This effect is similar to _[[spells/Beast Shape II|beast shape II]]_, shifting the drinker's consciousness into a Tiny form cosmetically similar to that of a _[[monsters/Chon Chon|chon chon]]_, with the same powers of _[[universal monster rules/Flight|flight]]_, constant _[[spells/Detect Magic|detect magic]]_ sight, and +4 racial bonus on Perception checks made to listen, but lacking the creature's acid spit or jabber abilities. The duration of this _[[spells/Transformation|transformation]]_ proves highly unpredictable, though. The GM should roll on the following chart to determine how long the effect lasts.

<table><tbody><tr><td> **d%**</td><td> **Duration of _Transformation_**</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1 minute</td></tr><tr><td>2–25</td><td>1d10 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>26–50</td><td>6d10 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>51–75</td><td>1 hour</td></tr><tr><td>76–80</td><td>1d10 hours</td></tr><tr><td>81–85</td><td>6d10 hours</td></tr><tr><td>86–90</td><td>1 day</td></tr><tr><td>91–95</td><td>1d6 days</td></tr><tr><td>96–99</td><td>1 week</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>Permanent</td></tr></tbody></table>

The _transformation_ can be ended prematurely by _[[spells/Remove Curse|remove curse]]_ — _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ has no effect. However, when the effect ends, the drinker's head immediately returns to normal. If the head is not within 5 feet of its body when the elixir's duration expires, the creature is slain immediately. The drinker knows when the elixir's effects will end 1 minute before they do so (no earlier). If the drinker's body is harmed or destroyed while its head is elsewhere, it takes that damage as soon as it reunites with its body, or is slain if its body has been destroyed. Until the elixir's duration ends, the drinker can only reattach its head to its body through the use of _remove curse_. The drinker's body is considered _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ while the head is unattached.
