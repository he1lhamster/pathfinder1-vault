Title: "Goblin Skull Bomb"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "1200 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "6"
Aura: "moderate evocation"
Description: |
  "An ember glow lights the beady eyes of this blackened, burned out goblin's skull. It is very brittle and shatters if dropped on solid ground. When a _goblin skull bomb_ breaks, the very last creature to touch it bursts into a raging magical flame, automatically suffering 5d6 points of fire damage and also catching fire should it fail a Reflex save (DC 13). If this kills the creature, its body burns away in one round, leaving behind only a pile of ash and the creature's blackened, burned-out skull, which is a new _goblin skull bomb_. If the target survives the fire, doesn't have a skull, or if its skull is destroyed before another creature touches it, it does not create a new _goblin skull bomb_.
  A skull bomb can be used as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. If the attacker hits, the skull shatters, immolating the target as described above. If the attacker misses, the skull breaks upon the floor or another nearby hard surface and the attacker bursts into flame. Touching the skull using gloves, gauntlets, or handheld items such as tools or weapons counts as touching the skull. It can be safely moved using spells (such as _mage hand_ or _telekinesis_) or attacked with ranged weapons (hardness 0, 1 hp)."
