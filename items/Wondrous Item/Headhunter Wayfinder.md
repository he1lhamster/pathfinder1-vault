Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "56000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate divination"
Description: |
  "The forms of numerous animals, magical beast, and other famous creatures appear in relief on every inch of this iron _wayfinder's_ surface, creating a maze of lions, hawks, dragons, and elephants. Though a _headhunter wayfinder_ looks like a normal compass, it doesn't point toward true north as one would expect. Rather, if a piece of hair, a drop of blood, or some other organic matter from a individual creature is placed in the socket normally reserved for an _ioun stone_, the _wayfinder's_ needle points out this creature as though it were the subject of a _locate creature_ spell with a radius of 680 feet from the _wayfinder's_ wielder. This effect has no set duration, and functions as long as a specimen of the target creature is held within the _wayfinder_ and the creature is within range. If the target creature isn't in range, the _headhunter wayfinder's_ needle slowly spins clockwise. As with the _locate creature_ spell, running water and spells such as _mislead_, _nondetection_, and _polymorph_ fool or otherwise block the effect. A _headhunter wayfinder_ can't hold an _ioun stone_ and doesn't provide resonant powers."
