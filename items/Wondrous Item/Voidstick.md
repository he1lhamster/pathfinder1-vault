Description: |
  "Each _voidstick_ is 6 to 10 inches long, with a diameter of about an inch. Carved from single pieces of polished darkwood, they often display markings or symbols sacred to the deity of their creator, but can just as easily be plain and smooth. Planting a _voidstick_ into the ground with an appropriate prayer is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The device floods the area with negative energy, producing an effect identical to the _desecrate_ spell in a 20- foot radius. In addition, any evil divine caster within 20 feet of the _voidstick_ may cast her spells without the need for any material component with a value of 10 gp or less, or any focus item with a value of 50 gp or less. This ability functions only for the individual planting the _voidstick_ and persists until the stick is uprooted.
  While this is a useful tool for shamans in locations poorly serviced by trade in magical goods, it pales in comparison to the _voidstick's_ most potent function: the creation of undead. Creating a voidstick zombie requires an hour-long ritual during which foul symbols are drawn across a corpse's flesh. At the end of the hour, the creator must make a DC 25 Knowledge (religion) check before driving the first _voidstick_ into the victim's heart. If this check succeeds, the victim is transformed into a voidstick zombie. To fully animate the creature, one _voidstick_ must be used for each Hit Die the base creature has. In 12 rounds, the creature rises under its own power, eager to spread its negative energy and snuff out life nearby. Undead created using voidsticks are not under the control of their creator but can be commanded using channeled negative energy, spells, or similar effects.
  _Voidsticks_ can also be driven into a living body to slay the creature and transition it to undeath. If a living body is used, the creature must be pinned or otherwise helpless for the duration of the entire ritual. When the ritual is complete and the first _voidstick_ is inserted, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save. If this save succeeds, the creature is reduced to 0 hit points and is dying, but the magic of the _voidstick_ and the ritual are wasted and the ritual must be performed again, using another _voidstick_. If the save fails, the creature dies and the ritual is successful, transforming the base creature into a voidstick zombie.
  Undead that contain such an item benefit from the +2 bonus hit points per Hit Die for having been created in the area of an enhanced _desecrate_ spell."

### Description

Each _[[items/Wondrous Item/Voidstick|voidstick]]_ is 6 to 10 inches long, with a diameter of about an inch. Carved from single pieces of polished darkwood, they often display markings or symbols _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sacred|sacred]]_ to the deity of their creator, but can just as easily be plain and smooth. Planting a _voidstick_ into the ground with an appropriate _[[spells/Prayer|prayer]]_ is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The device floods the area with negative energy, producing an effect identical to the _[[spells/Desecrate|desecrate]]_ spell in a 20- foot radius. In addition, any evil divine caster within 20 feet of the _voidstick_ may cast her spells without the need for any material component with a value of 10 gp or less, or any focus item with a value of 50 gp or less. This ability functions only for the individual planting the _voidstick_ and persists until the stick is uprooted.

While this is a useful tool for shamans in locations poorly serviced by trade in magical goods, it pales in comparison to the _voidstick_'s most _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ function: the creation of undead. Creating a _[[monsters/Voidstick Zombie|voidstick zombie]]_ requires an hour-long ritual during which foul symbols are drawn across a corpse's flesh. At the end of the hour, the creator must make a DC 25 Knowledge (religion) check before driving the first _voidstick_ into the victim's heart. If this check succeeds, the victim is transformed into a _voidstick zombie_. To fully animate the creature, one _voidstick_ must be used for each Hit Die the base creature has. In 12 rounds, the creature rises under its own power, eager to spread its negative energy and snuff out life nearby. Undead created using voidsticks are not under the control of their creator but can be commanded using channeled negative energy, spells, or similar effects.

Voidsticks can also be driven into a living body to slay the creature and transition it to undeath. If a living body is used, the creature must be _[[conditions/Pinned|pinned]]_ or otherwise _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ for the duration of the entire ritual. When the ritual is complete and the first _voidstick_ is inserted, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save. If this save succeeds, the creature is reduced to 0 hit points and is _[[conditions/Dying|dying]]_, but the magic of the _voidstick_ and the ritual are wasted and the ritual must be performed again, using another _voidstick_. If the save fails, the creature dies and the ritual is successful, transforming the base creature into a _voidstick zombie_.

Undead that contain such an item benefit from the +2 bonus hit points per Hit Die for having been created in the area of an enhanced _desecrate_ spell.
