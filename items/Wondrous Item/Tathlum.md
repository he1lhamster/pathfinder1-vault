Price: "–"

Aura: "strong evocation, strong necromancy"
Description: |
  "This horned and frilled dragon's head is coated with a thick layer of white lime. When dropped from a height of at least 150 feet, the _tathlum_ detonates in an explosion of greasy darkness, dealing 20d6 points of damage to all creatures within a 150-foot-radius spread from its point of impact (Will DC 25 half). Good or lawful living creatures with 9 Hit Dice or fewer within this area must also succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or die. This area is immediately affected by _unhallow_ with _darkness_ as an associated spell effect. In addition, concussive force blasts outward from the darkness, dealing 10d6 points of damage to all creatures within the area between 150 feet and 300 feet from the impact point (Will DC 21 half). The _tathlum_ is consumed in the explosion.
  If at least 200 Hit Dice worth of creatures are killed by the _tathlum's_ detonation, the explosion spontaneously creates 1d6 nightwalkers (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2_ 201) within 150 feet of the point of impact. On particularly dense battlefields, the detonation instead creates 1d6 warsworns (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4_ 272). These undead creatures are free-willed and not under the control of the _tathlum's_ wielder.
  If the _tathlum_ is dropped from a height of less than 150 feet, it deals 3d6 points of damage to a single creature as a falling object (_Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook_ 443), plus an additional 2d6 points of damage if the target is good or lawful. The _tathlum_ takes no damage and is not destroyed if dropped from a height of less than 150 feet."
Destruction: |
  "If dropped from a height of 150 feet or more, the _tathlum_ detonates and is permanently destroyed."

This horned and frilled dragon's head is coated with a thick layer of white lime. When dropped from a height of at least 150 feet, the _[[items/Wondrous Item/Tathlum|tathlum]]_ detonates in an explosion of greasy _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_, dealing 20d6 points of damage to all creatures within a 150-foot-radius spread from its point of _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Impact|impact]]_ (Will DC 25 half). Good or lawful living creatures with 9 Hit Dice or fewer within this area must also succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or die. This area is immediately affected by _[[spells/Unhallow|unhallow]]_ with _darkness_ as an associated spell effect.

If the _tathlum_ is dropped from a height of less than 150 feet, it deals 3d6 points of damage to a single creature as a falling object (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 443), plus an additional 2d6 points of damage if the target is good or lawful.
