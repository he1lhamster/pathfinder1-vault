Description: |
  "Mystic symbols embroidered in gold thread decorate this conical hat. Three times per day as a free action when casting a spell, the wearer can shift metamagic feats on prepared spells. The wearer can either move a metamagic feat from another prepared spell to a spell being cast or from the spell being cast to another prepared spell. In either case, the spell that gains the metamagic feat can't exceed the spell slot of the spell that originally had the metamagic feat. For example, a wizard with _detect thoughts_, _silent dispel magic_, and _dimension door_ prepared could cast a _silent detect thoughts_ (and would now have _dispel magic_ prepared), but could not cast _silent dimension door_. Moving metamagic feats does not increase spell casting time, even for quickened spells. The hat provides no benefit to spontaneous casting or spell-like abilities."
