Weight: "4 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "20"
Aura: "overwhelming transmutation"
Description: |
  "Long ago, the tyrannical elemental lords waged war on their benevolent counterparts and imprisoned them in powerful, unique artifacts. This lost artifact imprisons Lysianassa, Empress of the Torrent, much like _the Moaning Diamond_ (see _Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Artifacts &amp; Legends_) holds Sairazul, the Crystalline Queen. The _Gasping Pearl_ appears to be a perfectly spherical iridescent abalone pearl the size of a human fist. At all times, it gives forth a choking, gasping sound, as if struggling to breathe. Despite this constant, disturbing noise, the _Gasping Pearl_ is not evil. Three times per day, the bearer can call upon its power to move and control water as if by the spell _control water_, affecting a 500-foot-by-500-foot area up to 100 feet deep. Once per day, the _Gasping Pearl_ can also summon an elder water elemental (_Bestiary 127_) with maximum hit points that serves the caster until it is slain; only one such elemental can be summoned at a time."
Destruction: |
  "The Gasping Pearl can be smashed by the combined power of three elemental princes, one each from the Planes of Air, Earth, and Fire. Even then, the dust must be cast into a place where it will never touch even a drop of water."
