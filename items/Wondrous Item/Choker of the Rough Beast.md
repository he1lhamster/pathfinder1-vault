Description: |
  "This black iron neckpiece is forged in the likeness of Rovagug's holy symbol. An evil wearer gains a +2 profane bonus on all saving throws. A creature with the touch of corruption class ability that wears the _choker of the Rough Beast_ increases the damage dice of that ability from 1d6 per 2 antipaladin levels to 1d8 per 2 levels.
  Good-aligned creatures within 120 feet of the _choker of the Rough Beast_ hear distant bellows of unimaginable rage, giving them a –2 penalty on all Perception checks as the sounds distract them. Within 30 feet of the necklace, the sound increases, and all good-aligned creatures must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or be shaken while within range. They can attempt another save after 24 hours.
  If the wearer willingly breaks the choker in half (a fullround action), the ground under his feet ruptures open and consumes him (as the _imprisonment_ spell). The blood of Rovagug seeps up from the wound in the earth 1d6 rounds after the wielder is consumed. Treat this as a fiendish carnivorous blob (Bestiary 2 51, 292) that attacks any living creature within sight. The hole seals immediately after the blood rises."
