Description: |
  "This jagged crown is composed of ice that never melts regardless of the ambient temperature. The _Icecrown of Irrisen_ is the royal regalia of the queen of Irrisen, was crafted by Baba Yaga specifically for that role, and has been worn by all of Baba Yaga's daughters who have served as monarchs of that realm. When placed on the head, the Icecrown merges with the wearer so that icicles seem to grow directly from her head. Once in place, the crown can be removed only by Baba Yaga or upon the death of the wearer or the destruction of the crown. The _Icecrown of Irrisen_ deals 3d6 points of cold damage per round to any creature touching or wearing it as it absorbs body heat (or 6d6 points of cold damage per round to a creature with the fire subtype).
  The _Icecrown of Irrisen_ grants its wearer the following abilities: fire resistance 20, spell resistance 32, and a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence and Charisma (with ranks in Knowledge [local] and Sense Motive, as a _headband of vast intelligence_). The wearer doesn't take penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution from being of middle age or older (_Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook_ 169), and retains a youthful appearance, always appearing to be the same age as when she first put on the crown. Once per day, the wearer can summon three elder ice elementals that remain for 1 hour and follow her commands. In addition, the Icecrown gives its wearer the following abilities:
  Constant— _tongues_
  At will— _frigid touch_, _ice crystal teleport_, _Irriseni mirror sight*_, _unseen servant_
  3/day— _control weather_, _dominate monster_ (creatures with the cold subtype only), _ice spears_ *
  1/day— _overwhelming presence_, _polar midnight_
  Finally, the _Icecrown of Irrisen_ gives its wearer the ability to shape the ice that forms the Royal Palace in Whitethrone, allowing her to create or destroy walls, doors, windows, and even furnishings and decorations at will."
Destruction: |
  "The _Icecrown of Irrisen_ can be destroyed only if the perpetual winter that shrouds the land of Irrisen ends and the normal course of the seasons returns. In this case, the _Icecrown_ melts away on the first day of Irrisen's new spring."
