Aura: "strong enchantment, strong transmutation"
Description: |
  "Fine links spread from this gold bracelet to rings and finger-capping claws. This ornament was once a _vambrace of the genie_, but its magic has been warped and corrupted by daemon spirit trapped within.
  The _Handflower of Genocide_ grants its wearer a +2 profane bonus to Strength and a +4 profane bonus on checks to perform dirty trick and grapple combat maneuvers. The wearer can cast _murderous command_ at will by caressing a target with the _Handflower_ (reducing the spell's range to touch and requiring a melee touch attack). Once per day as a full-round action, the wearer can concentrate to locate the nearest source of mass death within 500 miles, the _Handflower_ directs her unerringly toward the death as per the _find the path_ spell.
  If the wearer touches a creature without casting _murderous command_, the wearer must immediately succeed at a DC 18 Will save or be compelled to strangle the creature touched. If the wearer fails, she must attempt a combat maneuver check against the target's CMD, including any bonuses to grapple. If successful, the target must immediately begin holding its breath, and every subsequent successful combat maneuver check reduces the time remaining until it suffocates by 1d6 rounds. The wearer can attempt a new Will save each round to stop strangling her victim, but she takes a cumulative –1 penalty for each prior failed check."
Destruction: |
  "While wearing the _Handflower of Genocide_, a creature must foster a romance between a protean and an inevitable, and have each kiss the bracelet to grant its blessing."
