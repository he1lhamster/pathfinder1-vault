  "These glittering anklets or spurs are favorites of Varisians, both for their showy addition to performances and their more practical uses. Normally made of metal and leather and adorned with glass beads or small gemstones, they make the wearer's feet light and agile, granting a +5 competence bonus to Perform (dance) checks.
