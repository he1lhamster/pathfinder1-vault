Caster level: "30"
Aura: "overwhelming transmutation"
Description: |
  "The _Codex_ is enormous—supposedly, it requires two strong men to lift it. No matter how many pages are turned, another always remains. Anyone opening the _Codex_ for the first time is utterly annihilated, as with a _destruction_ spell (Fortitude DC 30). Those who survive can peruse its pages and learn its powers, though not without risk. Each day spent studying the _Codex_ allows the reader to make a Spellcraft check (DC 50) to learn one of its powers (choose the power learned randomly; add a +1 circumstance bonus on the check per additional day spent reading until a power is learned). However, each day of study also forces the reader to make a Will save (DC 30 + 1 per day of study) to avoid being driven insane (as the _insanity_ spell). The powers of the _Codex of the Infinite Planes_ are as follows: _astral projection_, _banishment_, _elemental swarm_, _gate_, _greater planar ally_, _greater planar binding_, _plane shift_, and _soul bind_. Each of these spell-like abilities are usable at will by the owner of the Codex (assuming that he or she has learned how to access the power). The _Codex of the Infinite Planes_ has a caster level of 30th for the purposes of all powers and catastrophes, and all saving throw DCs are 20 + spell level. Activating any power requires a Spellcraft check (DC 40 + twice the spell level of the power; the character can't take 10 on this check). Any failure on either check indicates that a catastrophe befalls the user (roll on the table below for the effect). A character can incur only one catastrophe per power use."
Destruction: |
  "The _Codex of the Infinite Planes_ is destroyed if one page is torn out and left on each plane in existence. Note that tearing out a page immediately triggers a catastrophe."

### Description

The Codex is enormous—supposedly, it requires two strong men to lift it. No matter how many pages are turned, another always remains. Anyone opening the Codex for the first time is utterly annihilated, as with a _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ spell (Fortitude DC 30). Those who survive can peruse its pages and learn its powers, though not without risk. Each day spent studying the Codex allows the reader to make a Spellcraft check (DC 50) to learn one of its powers (choose the power learned randomly; add a +1 circumstance bonus on the check per additional day spent reading until a power is learned). However, each day of study also forces the reader to make a Will save (DC 30 + 1 per day of study) to avoid being driven insane (as the _[[spells/Insanity|insanity]]_ spell). The powers of the _[[items/Wondrous Item/Codex of the Infinite Planes|Codex of the Infinite Planes]]_ are as follows: _[[spells/Astral Projection|astral projection]]_, _[[spells/Banishment|banishment]]_, _[[spells/Elemental Swarm|elemental swarm]]_, _[[spells/Gate|gate]]_, greater _[[spells/Planar Ally, Greater|planar ally, greater]]_ _[[spells/Planar Binding|planar binding]]_, _[[spells/Plane Shift|plane shift]]_, and _[[spells/Soul Bind|soul bind]]_. Each of these _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ are usable at will by the owner of the Codex (assuming that he or she has learned how to access the power). The _Codex of the Infinite Planes_ has a caster level of 30th for the purposes of all powers and catastrophes, and all saving throw DCs are 20 + spell level. Activating any power requires a Spellcraft check (DC 40 + twice the spell level of the power; the character can't take 10 on this check). Any failure on either check indicates that a catastrophe befalls the user (roll on the table below for the effect). A character can incur only one catastrophe per power use.
