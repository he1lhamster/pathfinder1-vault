Description: |
  "This slim golden diadem, bejeweled with diamonds and sapphires, grants its wearer fluency in Celestial and allows her to _detect evil_ at will and use tongues once per day, both on command. She also gains a +5 sacred bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks regarding outsiders with the good or evil subtypes, and any effect she creates with the good descriptor takes effect at +1 caster level.
  A _crown_, an _orb_, and a _scepter of heaven_ —collectively known as a _regalia of heaven_ —increase in power when used together. If the wearer of a _crown of heaven_ wields an _orb_ or _scepter of heaven_, effects she creates with the good descriptor gain an additional +1 caster level, and she gains a +1 sacred bonus to AC and on saves against attacks or effects created by evil creatures. She also radiates an _aura of menace_ in a 20-foot radius. Any evil creature within this aura takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, on saving throws, and to AC until it successfully hits the wearer of the regalia (DC 20 Will negates). A creature that saves is immune to this effect for 24 hours. If the aura is dispelled, the wearer can restore it as a standard action.
  If the crown is worn while the wearer is wielding both an _orb_ and _scepter of heaven_, the crown's caster level increases to 15th, effects the wearer creates with the good descriptor gain an additional +1 caster level increase, and her sacred bonus to AC and saves increases to +2. In addition, as a full-round action, the wearer can create an _aura of sanctity_ for as long as she concentrates. This aura provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, as well as the benefits of a _magic circle against evil_ and a _lesser globe of invulnerability_.
  A _crown of heaven_ bestows one negative level on any evil creature bearing it, which cannot be removed or overcome while carrying the crown. If the same creature carries an _orb_ or _scepter of heaven_, it gains one additional negative level per object. An evil creature intentionally donning a _crown of heaven_ gains an additional negative level and is affected as _bestow curse_ (DC 17) immediately and every 24 hours that the crown is worn. A neutral character can attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save to avoid gaining these negative levels."
