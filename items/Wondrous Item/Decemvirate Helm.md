  "The members of the Pathfinder Society's administrative body, the Decemvirate, retain their anonymity by wearing closefaced, magically empowered helmets while fulfilling their official roles. The helms not only mask the wearers' faces, but also function as _helms of telepathy_ combined with _amulets of proof against detection and location_. The wearer of a _Decemvirate helm_ can use _disguise self_ at will and benefits from _discern lies_ and _true seeing_ at all times. The helm provides 100% protection from all gaze attacks and all forms of magical control. Specific _Decemvirate helms_ may have additional powers and all are said to be unique in physical appearance."

If one of these helms is worn by five or more individuals in one 24-hour period, it ceases to function for 1 day. If it is again worn by five or more individuals within 24 hours of regaining its properties, the helm permanently loses its magic properties."
