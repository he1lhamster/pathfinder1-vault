Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "2000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Neck"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "faint illusion"
Description: |
  "This small relic is designed to resemble a holy symbol of a genuine or fictional deity and can be worn about the neck. A _charlatan's symbol_ contains an extradimensional compartment that can hold one wand of a 1st-level cleric spell, which becomes attuned to the symbol after 24 hours. Speaking a command word or phrase activates the wand as if the user had succeeded at a DC 20 Use Magic Device check, which also causes the symbol to glow faintly. Those observing a spell cast through the use of a _charlatan's symbol_ must succeed at a DC 20 Spellcraft check in order to determine that the spell was cast from a wand rather than through normal divine spellcasting.
  After using the symbol, the wearer receives a +5 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks related to the assumed religion against witnesses for 24 hours.
  To anyone using _detect magic_, the _charlatan's symbol_ appears to be nonmagical (as _magic aura_), as if it were a standard holy symbol."
