Price: "1400 gp"
Weight: "0.5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate abjuration"
Description: |
  "Little distinguishes this bitter-smelling stick of incense from normal incense until it is lit. In still air, the incense's smoke permeates a 40-foot-by-40-foot area to a height of 20 feet. Within that area, incorporeal creatures take on a measure of substance, such that they can no longer pass through objects and take full damage from all attacks (even nonmagical ones). Incorporeal touch attacks within this area resolve as melee attacks, but the incorporeal creatures add their Charisma bonus on such attacks. Incorporeal creatures still lack cohesion and mass. They retain the ability to fly as well as their immunity to combat maneuvers and critical hits. They can pick up and manipulate physical objects as though they had Strength scores equal to their Charisma scores, but they are still not solid enough to wear equipment.
  Moderate wind halves the area of _incense of corporeality_. Strong wind disperses the incense, rendering it ineffective as long as the wind continues. A single stick of _incense of corporeality_ burns for 1 hour. If extinguished, the remaining incense loses effectiveness."

### Description

Little distinguishes this bitter-smelling stick of _[[items/Mundane/Incense|incense]]_ from normal _incense_ until it is lit. In still air, the _incense_'s smoke permeates a 40-foot-by-40-foot area to a height of 20 feet. Within that area, _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ creatures take on a measure of substance, such that they can no longer pass through objects and take full damage from all attacks (even nonmagical ones). _Incorporeal_ touch attacks within this area resolve as melee attacks, but the _incorporeal_ creatures add their Charisma bonus on such attacks. _Incorporeal_ creatures still lack cohesion and mass. They retain the ability to fly as well as their _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to combat maneuvers and critical hits. They can pick up and manipulate physical objects as though they had Strength scores equal to their Charisma scores, but they are still not solid enough to wear equipment.

Moderate wind halves the area of _[[items/Wondrous Item/Incense of Corporeality|incense of corporeality]]_. Strong wind disperses the _incense_, rendering it ineffective as long as the wind continues. A single stick of _incense of corporeality_ burns for 1 hour. If extinguished, the remaining _incense_ loses effectiveness.
