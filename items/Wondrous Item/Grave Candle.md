Description: |
  "Grave candles are magical candles that draw forth spirits from the mortal remains of long-dead creatures, allowing the living to speak to these spirits for a short period while the candle's wick burns. In order to function, a _grave candle_ must be placed amid the physical remains of the body whose spirit the user wishes to contact. These remains can be partial, or even just a handful of ash or grave dust, but a totally destroyed body (as results from _destruction_ or _disintegrate_) doesn't leave enough material for a grave candle to function. When the candle is lit, the smoke rising from the candle grows thick, and a ghostly shape similar to the creature's appearance in life manifests in the smoke.
  At this point, the manifested spirit (which is as much an echo of the creature as it is the actual departed soul) can speak. A _grave candle_ does not impart any additional understanding of languages to its user. In other respects, the conversation with the dead spirit adheres to the rules for _speak with dead_, save that the dead spirit takes a –4 penalty on its saving throw to resist the spell. Furthermore, a dead body can be subjected to the effects of a _grave candle_ only once—the burning of a _grave candle_ effectively burns out the latent necromantic and spiritual energy left behind by the soul's departure from the world (this does not harm the actual soul of the dead spirit, however) and destroys the candle."

### Description

Grave candles are magical candles that draw forth spirits from the mortal remains of long-dead creatures, allowing the living to speak to these spirits for a short period while the _[[items/Mundane/Candle|candle]]_'s wick burns. In order to function, a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Grave Candle|grave candle]]_ must be placed amid the physical remains of the body whose spirit the user wishes to contact. These remains can be partial, or even just a handful of ash or grave dust, but a totally destroyed body (as results from _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ or _[[spells/Disintegrate|disintegrate]]_) doesn't leave enough material for a _grave candle_ to function. When the _candle_ is lit, the smoke rising from the _candle_ grows thick, and a ghostly shape similar to the creature's appearance in life manifests in the smoke.

At this point, the manifested spirit (which is as much an _[[spells/Echo|echo]]_ of the creature as it is the actual departed soul) can speak. A _grave candle_ does not impart any additional understanding of languages to its user. In other respects, the conversation with the dead spirit adheres to the rules for _[[spells/Speak with Dead|speak with dead]]_, save that the dead spirit takes a –4 penalty on its saving throw to resist the spell. Furthermore, a dead body can be subjected to the effects of a _grave candle_ only once—the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Burning|burning]]_ of a _grave candle_ effectively burns out the latent necromantic and spiritual energy left behind by the soul's departure from the world (this does not _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ the actual soul of the dead spirit, however) and destroys the _candle_.
