  "Belimarius's spellbook holds an infinite number of pages to inscribe spells upon. Any wizard who prepares spells from a _Sihedron Tome_ can prepare bonus spells as if her Intelligence were 6 points higher. This is not an actual bonus to Intelligence and grants the user no additional benefit. Belimarius's _Sihedron Tome_ contains all sorcerer/wizard spells (save for those of the schools of evocation and necromancy) found in the _Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook_ as well as those she has prepared. At the GM's discretion, it could certainly hold more spells."

  "A special 9th-level spell must be designed that exists only to destroy the specific and particular Sihedron Tome into which it is inscribed. This spell, which has numerous expensive and rare material components, must then be cast on the _Sihedron Tome_ by its owner."
