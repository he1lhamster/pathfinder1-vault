Description: |
  "This sturdy tool has a wooden haft topped with a curved pick head backed with a sharp adze blade at one end and capped with an iron spike on the other. When used as a climbing aid, an _alpine ice axe_ grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks to scale rock or ice walls. In addition, an _alpine ice axe_ negates any Climb DC modifiers for climbing a slippery surface. Three times per day as a standard action, the wielder can strike an area of ice or snow with the ice axe to instantly create a series of sturdy handholds in the ice covering a distance of up to 40 feet. An ice wall with these handholds has a Climb DC of 15.
  An _alpine ice axe_ is a tool, not a weapon, but it may be used as an improvised weapon with the usual –4 penalty on attack rolls made with it. An _alpine ice axe_ wielded as a weapon functions either as a _+1 light pick_ when striking with the pick spike or as a _+1 hand axe_ when striking with the adze blade. The ice axe uses the standard threat range and critical modifier for those weapons. An _alpine ice axe_ deals double damage against inanimate ice or snow, and if used as a weapon against a creature made mostly of ice (such as an ice elemental or ice golem), an _alpine ice axe_ bypasses that creature's damage reduction."
