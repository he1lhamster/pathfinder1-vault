Description: |
  "This belt is constructed from woven vines. Its wearer can touch a willing creature and cause a ghostly vine to grow from the belt, connecting the wearer to the target creature. While connected to another creature, when the wearer casts a druid, ranger, shaman, or witch spell with a range of touch on herself, both the wearer and the connected creature gain the benefits of the spell for half the spell's duration (rounded down); this has no effect on instantaneous or permanent spells. The spell's effects on the connected creature end if the vine's range is exceeded.
  The vine can grow up to a length of 30 feet, and it vanishes if the wearer or connected creature moves beyond its maximum range. The vine can remain connected indefinitely, but the connection is broken if the wearer dismisses it or connects the vine to another creature."
