Aura: "strong evocation"
Description: |
  "A _whispering amulet_ looks like a bejeweled glabrezu head to the person who owns it, but to anyone else appears to be a relatively unremarkable necklace. As long as it is worn, a _whispering amulet_ masks the wearer's alignment as if by _undetectable alignment_. Once per day by grasping the amulet in one hand and whispering, as a standard action, the wearer may send a single message of no more than 25 words to another creature as if via _sending_ —the message arrives at the intended target in the form of a soft whisper in the left ear, and the recipient can opt to whisper a return message to the wearer of the amulet. A single glabrezu is linked to each _whispering amulet_, and any message sent or received via the amulet can be heard by the demon as well. Finally, by grasping the amulet and whispering the glabrezu's name, the wearer can make a single _wish_. This destroys the _whispering amulet_, and as the _wish_ itself is granted by the glabrezu, it likely has unexpected and unintended consequences. If the glabrezu has already used its _wish_ ability during that month, the attempt to wish fails and the amulet is not destroyed— there's a 5% chance that this occurs if the GM doesn't already know for sure if the glabrezu's _wish_ is available."

### Description

A _[[items/Wondrous Item/Whispering Amulet|whispering amulet]]_ looks like a bejeweled glabrezu head to the person who owns it, but to anyone else appears to be a relatively unremarkable necklace. As long as it is worn, a _whispering amulet_ masks the wearer's alignment as if by _[[spells/Undetectable Alignment|undetectable alignment]]_. Once per day by grasping the amulet in one hand and whispering, as a standard action, the wearer may send a single _[[spells/Message|message]]_ of no more than 25 words to another creature as if via _[[spells/Sending|sending]]_ —the _message_ arrives at the intended target in the form of a soft whisper in the left ear, and the recipient can opt to whisper a return _message_ to the wearer of the amulet. A single glabrezu is linked to each _whispering amulet_, and any _message_ sent or received via the amulet can be heard by the demon as well. Finally, by grasping the amulet and whispering the glabrezu's name, the wearer can make a single _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_. This destroys the _whispering amulet_, and as the _wish_ itself is granted by the glabrezu, it likely has unexpected and unintended consequences. If the glabrezu has already used its _wish_ ability during that month, the attempt to _wish_ fails and the amulet is not destroyed— there's a 5% chance that this occurs if the GM doesn't already know for sure if the glabrezu's _wish_ is available.
