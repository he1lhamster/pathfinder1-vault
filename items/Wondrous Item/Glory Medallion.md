  "This miniature sword emblazoned with a sunburst functions as a holy symbol of Iomedae. If Iomedae is the bearer's patron, when channeling positive energy, the bearer can treat one die roll of a 1 as a 6 when determining the amount of damage healed by living creatures or dealt to undead creatures. In addition, once per day, the bearer can expend uses of his channel energy ability to dispel a darkness spell of lower than 9th level within a 30-foot-radius burst. One use of channel energy is consumed for every level of darkness spell dispelled this way. If the bearer doesn't have enough uses of channel energy to match the level of the spell, the spell is not dispelled."
