Description: |
  "Made from a single male lion's coat with the mane surrounding its hood, the lion cloak is an impressive sight. A creature wearing the cloak gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws made against mind-affecting and fear effects and a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks. Once per day, the wearer can pull the hood over her head, assuming the form of a lion (as the _beast shape II_ spell, except that it allows only lion form) for up to 10 minutes. If the wearer has the smite class feature, she can use this power more than once per day by expending uses of her smite; at most she can take the lion form as many times as she has smites plus one additional time. While in this lion form the wearer cannot use its normal smite ability."
