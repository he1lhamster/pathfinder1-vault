Title: "Boulder Bag"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "3000 gp"
Weight: "200 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate conjuration"
Description: |
  "This immense bag is always full of hefty, good-sized rocks and can be carried over the shoulder or on the belt of a Large or larger creature, though doing so does not take up an item slot. On command as a swift action, a Large or larger creature wearing the _boulder bag_ can reach into the bag and pull out a rock two size categories smaller than itself that is suitable for use of the rock throwing ability (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary_ 303). No matter how many rocks are taken out, the bag never empties. Furthermore, if a boulder-shaped alchemical item (such as the fiery boulder presented in this article) is placed in the bag, it takes up no weight within the bag, and can also be drawn on command as a swift action, as if it were one of the rocks the bag normally produces."
