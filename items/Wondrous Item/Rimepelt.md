Weight: "5 lbs."
Slot: "Shoulders"
Caster level: "11"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "This snow-white fur pelt of a winter wolf can be worn over the shoulders as a cloak. The pelt functions as furs, granting its wearer a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves to resist cold weather. The wearer can, as a standard action, transform into a Large winter wolf as if using _beast shape IV_. In certain special locations where winter wolves have the ability to take human form, such as the Howlings district of Whitethrone or the town of Redtooth, the wearer of a _rimepelt_ in wolf form can take human form as winter wolves do, appearing as a whitehaired, blue-eyed human. In either wolf or human form, the wearer of a _rimepelt_ smells like a winter wolf to other winter wolves and creatures with the scent ability. When the wearer returns to his normal form, or after 2 hours have elapsed, the rimepelt becomes a mundane winter wolf pelt.
  Very rarely, a properly skinned winter wolf pelt manifests the properties of a _rimepelt_ without requiring additional enchantment. A winter wolf whose pelt has such potential usually manifests some telltale physical attribute, such as heterochromatic eyes. Creating a _rimepelt_ from such a rare creature requires a successful DC 25 Profession (hunter) or Survival check. Taking 20 is not allowed in this situation, and a failed check results in the pelt being utterly ruined for any use."
