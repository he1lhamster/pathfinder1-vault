Title: "Discord Bottle"

Price: "5400 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "faint conjuration, faint enchantment"
Description: |
  "This black metal urn with a lead stopper bears the image of countless gaunt humanoids piled on top of one another in a torturous melee. When the stopper is removed, an invisible and odorless gas pours from the bottle, covering a 50-foot-radius area in 1 round. If the bottle is left open, the gas billows out another 10 feet per round until it has covered a 100-foot radius. This area remains filled with gas for 5 rounds, after which the gas dissipates naturally.
  Each round, a creature within the area of the gas must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or attack the nearest creature on its next turn. This condition lasts long as a creature is in the cloud and for 1 round after it leaves the area or after the gas dissipates. Any creature that succeeds at its save is not subject to the same gas again, whether or not it remains within the area. This is a mind-affecting poison effect.
  A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the gas in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses it in 1 round.
  Once opened, a _discord bottle_ must be restoppered and recharge for 24 hours before it can be used again."
Crafting cost: "2700 gp"

When the stopper is removed, an _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ and odorless gas pours from the _[[items/Mundane/Bottle|bottle]]_, covering a 50-foot-radius area in 1 round.
