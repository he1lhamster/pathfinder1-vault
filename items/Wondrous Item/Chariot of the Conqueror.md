Caster level: "18"
Aura: "strong abjuration, strong conjuration"
Description: |
  "This fantastic vehicle was fashioned specifically for General Tawaret, who rode it into battle throughout her military career. The _chariot of the conqueror_ is a light chariot pulled by a team of two ghostly manticores controlled by beaded reigns. The manticores can only draw the chariot; they cannot attack or otherwise act. The chariot's statistics are **Hardness** 10, **hp** 180, **Base Save** +2, **Maximum Speed** 200 ft., fly 200 ft. (perfect); **Acceleration** 100 ft., fly 100 ft.; all other statistics conform to those of a standard light chariot (_Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat_ 181).
  The chariot of the conqueror treats all terrain as normal, including water—the vehicle glides smoothly over liquid as though it were pavement—and can even fly. On command, the chariot can drive itself for up to 1 hour with a +20 bonus on drive checks, following the driver's verbal orders. Otherwise, the driver must attempt driving checks to control the ghostly steeds drawing the chariot as normal (_Ultimate Combat_ 170).
  The _chariot of the conqueror_ can carry up to two Medium creatures: one driver and one passenger. Creatures riding in the chariot gain a +4 cover bonus to AC. Passengers balance perfectly while riding in the vehicle, even if it's moving sideways or upside down, making it a perfect platform for archers or others making ranged attacks. Damage to the chariot can be magically repaired, but if reduced to 0 hit points, it's destroyed."
Crafting cost: "45000 gp"
