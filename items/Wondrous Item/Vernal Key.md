Price: "–"
Weight: "5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "20"
Aura: "strong transmutation"
Description: |
  "The _Vernal Key_ consists of three lattice orbs, one inside the other, all carved from a single piece of blue mineral. The key was created to unlock a jarl's prison, but as a side effect it also protects the region around it from the ravages of winter.
  Within a 5-mile radius of the _Vernal Key_, otherwise cold weather (below 40° F) becomes moderate, while severe cold (below 0° F) becomes only cold. A mild wind demarcates the edge of this effect. The key must remain stationary (unattended) to produce this effect; it takes 24 hours for the artifact to attune itself to its locale. The key only ameliorates natural weather; it has no effect on magically created effects or extraplanar environments."
Destruction: |
  "The power of the _Vernal Key_ is intrinsically tied to the Elemental Plane of Air, where it was created. It can only be destroyed by returning it to that plane and then using a _rod of cancellation_ on it."
