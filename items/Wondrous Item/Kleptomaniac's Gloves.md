Description: |
  "These simple calfskin gloves intensify the avaricious inclinations of their wearer. _Kleptomaniac's gloves_ confer the same +5 competence bonus on Sleight of Hands checks as _gloves of larceny_ (_Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment_ 237), but the first time the wearer attempts to take something from a given creature with a Sleight of Hand check, she must attempt another such check against that creature at the first available opportunity, whether or not the first attempt was successful. This increases the DC of the check by 10, as though the first attempt were a failure, and it imparts a –20 penalty on the check. _Kleptomaniac's gloves_ can be removed only after the wearer benefits from a _remove curse_ spell or similar effect."
