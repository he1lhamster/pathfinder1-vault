Description: |
  "Appearing at first like an expensive, masochistic adornment, this almond-sized star ruby is set in a gold clasp, one side of which is festooned with several long spikes. A _soulbound eye_ is not an item that most creatures would voluntarily wear— they are instead crafted by powerful creatures who wish to use another creature as a sort of remote-viewing slave. A _soulbound eye_ must be attached to a willing or helpless creature by pressing the spike-covered surface to the creature's brow—the gem swiftly and painfully embeds itself in the victim's forehead, immediately activating to forge a shared link between the wearer and the creature who placed the item on its head (the "master").
  Once implanted, the _soulbound eye_ allows the master to observe the world around the wearer through the wearer's senses. It also allows for telepathic communication between the wearer and the master. Neither of these features function across planar boundaries.
  The _soulbound eye's_ wearer is not compelled to obey its master's telepathic commands, but the master can use the _soulbound eye_ as a conduit for _hold monster_, _modify memory_, _pain strike_ (_Advanced Player's Guide_), and _suggestion_ spells, treating the wearer as the target of the spell no matter the distance between master and wearer. The victim is allowed any normal saving throws or spell resistance against spells cast through the _soulbound eye_.
  An implanted _soulbound eye_ functions like a cursed item once it is in place—it can only be removed if the curse is first lifted via an effect like _remove curse_ or _break enchantment_. Once removed, a _soulbound eye_ crumbles to fragments."

A _[[items/Wondrous Item/Soulbound Eye|soulbound eye]]_ is not an item that most creatures would voluntarily wear— they are instead crafted by powerful creatures who _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ to use another creature as a sort of remote-viewing _[[items/Mundane/Slave|slave]]_. A _soulbound eye_ must be attached to a willing or _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ creature by pressing the spike-covered surface to the creature's brow—the gem swiftly and painfully embeds itself in the victim's forehead, immediately activating to forge a shared link between the wearer and the creature who placed the item on its head (the "master").

Once implanted, the _soulbound eye_ allows the master to observe the world around the wearer through the wearer's senses.
