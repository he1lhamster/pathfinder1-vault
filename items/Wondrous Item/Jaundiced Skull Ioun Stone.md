Title: "Jaundiced Skull Ioun Stone"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "–"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "16"
Aura: "strong abjuration"
Description: |
  "In addition to serving as a vessel for Auberon's soul, the _jaundiced skull ioun stone_ is a potent artifact with two protections against detection. First, when active, the _ioun stone_ is invisible as it orbits the bearer's head. Secondly, the _jaundiced skull ioun stone_ is immune to divination effects.
  If a lich activates this ioun stone, it can use its paralyzing touch as a ranged touch attack to a distance of 60 feet. In addition, if the lich whose soul is stored within the _jaundiced skull ioun stone_ is slain and someone else takes possession of the artifact, the rate at which the lich rejuvenates is accelerated, as the _ioun stone_ begins sapping the life force from its current bearer. The stone's bearer quickly rots, taking 1 point of Constitution drain initially and every hour thereafter while it is activated unless the bearer succeeds at a DC 25 Fortitude save. The creature bearing the _ioun stone_ receives a new saving throw each time it would be subjected to Constitution drain. As long as the ioun stone has dealt at least 1 point of Constitution drain, the deterioration assists in the reformation of the lich's body, reducing the time required for rejuvenation to 1d10 hours instead of the normal 1d10 days."
Destruction: |
  "The _jaundiced skull ioun stone_ can be destroyed only after the destruction of the lich whose soul it holds and before the lich has rejuvenated. During this time, the _ioun stone_ must be subjected to a _consecrate_ spell and then be smashed to pieces. The jaundiced skull ioun stone has AC 26, 50 hit points, and hardness 10."
