Description: |
  "The iridescent, hazy contents of this glass container eddy briefly into different shapes. A _bottled cloud_ can be thrown as a splash weapon. When it strikes, it unleashes a bank of whitish-gray, semi-solid clouds in one of two configurations—a 20-foot-radius cloud or a 40-foot-radius sheet of mist that hovers a few inches above the ground. The user selects which version of the clouds she wishes to create as she throws the _bottled cloud_.
  If the _bottled cloud_ forms a 20-foot-radius cloud, it functions as a _solid fog_ spell.
  If the _bottled cloud_ is instead used to form a sheet, the layer of mist can be walked upon as if it were solid ground. While the _bottled cloud_ must be thrown against solid ground in order to shatter the container and release the cloud, it can be deliberately poured out on a liquid surface to form a sheet as well. The cloud sheet extends over liquid surfaces, but pours into concavities and holes—one can use a _bottled cloud_ to traverse water, but not a pit or chasm. The sheet of mist also allows safe movement over caltrops, difficult terrain that lies low to the ground (GM's discretion), and other low-lying hazards (such as a sheet of green slime) and traps that are triggered via pressure plates.
  Either use of a _bottled cloud_ can be dispersed by a severe wind (31+ mph) in a single round, but otherwise the effect created lasts for 3 minutes."

##### Magical properties

**Caster level:** 3 **Aura:** faint conjuration

### Description

The iridescent, hazy contents of this glass container eddy briefly into different shapes. A _[[items/Wondrous Item/Bottled Cloud|bottled cloud]]_ can be thrown as a splash weapon. When it strikes, it unleashes a bank of whitish-gray, semi-solid clouds in one of two configurations—a 20-foot-radius cloud or a 40-foot-radius sheet of mist that hovers a few inches above the ground. The user selects which version of the clouds she wishes to create as she throws the _bottled cloud_.

If the _bottled cloud_ forms a 20-foot-radius cloud, it functions as a _[[spells/Solid Fog|solid fog]]_ spell.

If the _bottled cloud_ is instead used to form a sheet, the layer of mist can be walked upon as if it were solid ground. While the _bottled cloud_ must be thrown against solid ground in order to _[[spells/Shatter|shatter]]_ the container and release the cloud, it can be deliberately poured out on a liquid surface to form a sheet as well. The cloud sheet extends over liquid surfaces, but pours into concavities and holes—one can use a _bottled cloud_ to traverse water, but not a pit or chasm. The sheet of mist also allows safe movement over _[[items/Mundane/Caltrops|caltrops]]_, difficult terrain that lies low to the ground (GM's discretion), and other low-lying hazards (such as a sheet of green slime) and traps that are triggered via pressure plates.

Either use of a _bottled cloud_ can be dispersed by a severe wind (31+ mph) in a single round, but otherwise the effect created lasts for 3 minutes.
