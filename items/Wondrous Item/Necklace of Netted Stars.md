Slot: "Neck"
Caster level: "12"
Aura: "strong illusion, strong transmutation"
Description: |
  "This marvelous mithral necklace forms a broad, draping lacework of threadlike chains set with a multitude of tiny jewels. Seven of these jewels are larger than the rest. While wearing a _necklace of netted stars_, the wearer can create _dancing lights_ at will and _wandering star motes_ (see _Advanced Player's Guide_) once per day. In addition, each of the seven jewels of the necklace can recall a previously cast 1st-level or 0-level spell, as a _pearl of power_.
  Once per day, the wearer may use the necklace to catch a spell targeted at him, as if readying an action to counterspell using _dispel magic_, with a bonus on the check equal to 12 + the number of jewels not yet used to recall spells that day. If all jewels have been used, this ability cannot be used that day. The level of the spell to be countered must be less than or equal to the number of unused jewels. If the counterspell succeeds, the spell is negated and the wearer can use its magical energy to recall a previously cast spell of the same level or lower as an immediate action. Whether or not the attempt succeeds, this action exhausts the power of all of the necklace's jewels for that day."
