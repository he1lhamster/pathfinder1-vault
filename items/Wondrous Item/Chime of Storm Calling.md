Description: |
  "This copper chime can be struck as a standard action, producing a cloud of mist around the user equivalent to an _obscuring mist_ spell. If struck again before the mist disperses, the user can call down the fury of a storm on a single target within the clouded area, either striking it with a bolt of lightning (3d6 electricity damage, Reflex DC 15 half) or buffeting it with a _gust of wind_ for 1 round, equivalent to the spell _gust of wind_. Either use immediately disperses the cloud of mist and renders the _chime of storm calling_ inert for 24 hours. If the _chime of storm calling_ is not struck again, the mist disperses after 5 minutes, after which it may be used again to create new banks of mist.
  A _chime of storm calling_ cannot summon lightning or wind while underground, indoors, or in an arid climate."
