Title: "Chalice of Lissala"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "–"
Weight: "4 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "22"
Aura: "overwhelming enchantment"
Description: |
  "The bowl of this elegant golden chalice resembles seven overlapping feathered wings, while the stand is shaped like a coiled snake. The chalice is inlaid with green gems that form spiky runes.
  This large golden chalice glitters and sparkles alluringly whenever a creature capable of using enchantment magic is within 30 feet of it. While holding the _Chalice of Lissala_ in hand, a spellcaster increases her caster level for spells and spell-like abilities of the enchantment school by 4 and increases the DC to resist them by 4. When the chalice's bearer casts a spell of the enchantment school against targets with spell resistance, she can roll her caster level check twice and use the better result. If a target creature is normally immune to the enchantment spell (such as a mindless or undead creature with a mind-affecting spell), the bearer can affect the creature as though it weren't immune, though in this case the spell uses her normal caster level and spell DC.
  Additionally, the _Chalice of Lissala_ grants its bearer a +5 competence bonus on Charisma-based checks."
Destruction: |
  "If all of Lissala's remaining worshipers perish or renounce their faith, the _Chalice of Lissala_ twists upon itself, turning into a worthless piece of blackened metal."
