Title: "Banner of Piracy"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "2500 gp"
Weight: "10 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "3"
Aura: "faint transmutation"
Description: |
  "Three small metal rings adorn one side of this long, rectangular piece of black fabric, which shimmers with magic. Once per day, if the banner is attached to the mast of a ship or other water-faring vessel, a passenger on board who has line of sight to the banner can say its command word and the name of a port of her choice to transform the banner into one of that port for the next 24 hours, complete with the correct colors and heraldry, as appropriate. When the banner transforms, it also transforms all flags and labels identifying the ship or vessel, including any on the ship's cargo if that cargo is labeled with a place of origin or destination. If the banner is removed from the mast of the ship at any time while it is obscuring its port of call, the banner and all identifying flags and labels on the ship revert to their original state. Flags and labels affected in this way all radiate a faint aura of transmutation magic, and if the magic affecting one flag or label (or the _banner of piracy_ itself) is suppressed, such as with dispel magic, all of the banner's magic is suppressed. Creatures that interact with banners, cargo, flags, or similar labels affected by this banner (such as by examining them very closely or touching them) can see through the banner's magic with a successful DC 14 Will saving throw."

### Description

Three small metal rings adorn one side of this long, rectangular piece of black fabric, which shimmers with magic. Once per day, if the _[[items/Mundane/Banner|banner]]_ is attached to the mast of a ship or other water-faring vessel, a passenger on board who has line of sight to the _banner_ can say its _[[spells/Command|command]]_ word and the name of a port of her choice to transform the _banner_ into one of that port for the next 24 hours, complete with the correct colors and heraldry, as appropriate. When the _banner_ transforms, it also transforms all flags and labels identifying the ship or vessel, including any on the ship's cargo if that cargo is labeled with a place of origin or destination. If the _banner_ is removed from the mast of the ship at any time while it is obscuring its port of call, the _banner_ and all identifying flags and labels on the ship revert to their original state. Flags and labels affected in this way all radiate a faint aura of transmutation magic, and if the magic affecting one _[[items/Mundane/Flag|flag]]_ or label (or the _[[items/Wondrous Item/Banner of Piracy|banner of piracy]]_ itself) is suppressed, such as with _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_, all of the _banner_'s magic is suppressed. Creatures that interact with banners, cargo, flags, or similar labels affected by this _banner_ (such as by examining them very closely or touching them) can see through the _banner_'s magic with a successful DC 14 Will saving throw.
