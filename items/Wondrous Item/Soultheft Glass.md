Description: |
  "The wielder of this hand-sized, fine glass mirror can view another's reflection in the mirror to capture a portion of that creature's soul. Doing so requires the wielder to avert his eyes as if defending against a gaze attack (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary_ 300) so that he views the creature only by its reflection, and then take a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. This imposes 1 temporary negative level on the creature reflected (Fortitude DC 16 negates). A _soultheft glass_ can hold no more than three portions of a creature's soul, and can't contain portions from more than one creature's soul at a time. When the glass is at full capacity, attempts to steal additional soul portions fail. While the mirror retains at least one soul portion, its possessor receives a +1 luck bonus on ability checks, saving throws, and skill checks.
  The wielder can query the soul portions trapped within, in effect questioning echoed memories of the target creature. This works as _call spirit_, except the creature doesn't need to be dead. The wielder can ask a number of questions per day equal to the number of soul portions in the glass.
  Temporary negative levels bestowed by a _soultheft glass_ never become permanent. The victim can attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save to remove each negative level every 24 hours. Success removes that negative level and frees one soul portion held within the glass. Any other method of removing a negative level (such as _restoration_) also frees a soul portion from the glass.
  Once it imposes a temporary negative level on a creature, a _soultheft glass_ shows a ghostly reflection of that creature (though not any information about its surroundings) until all soul portions have been returned. If the victim dies, its soul portions fade after 24 hours. As a standard action, the mirror's wielder can release all soul portions, which also removes the victim's negative levels."

### Description

The wielder of this hand-sized, fine glass _[[items/Mundane/Mirror|mirror]]_ can view another's reflection in the _mirror_ to capture a portion of that creature's soul. Doing so requires the wielder to avert his eyes as if _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Defending|defending]]_ against a _[[universal monster rules/Gaze|gaze]]_ attack (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 300) so that he views the creature only by its reflection, and then take a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. This imposes 1 temporary negative level on the creature reflected (Fortitude DC 16 negates). A _[[items/Wondrous Item/Soultheft Glass|soultheft glass]]_ can hold no more than three portions of a creature's soul, and can't contain portions from more than one creature's soul at a time. When the glass is at full capacity, attempts to steal additional soul portions fail. While the _mirror_ retains at least one soul portion, its possessor receives a +1 luck bonus on ability checks, saving throws, and skill checks.

The wielder can query the soul portions trapped within, in effect questioning echoed memories of the target creature. This works as _[[spells/Call Spirit|call spirit]]_, except the creature doesn't need to be dead. The wielder can ask a number of questions per day equal to the number of soul portions in the glass.

Temporary negative levels bestowed by a _soultheft glass_ never become permanent. The victim can attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save to remove each negative level every 24 hours. Success removes that negative level and frees one soul portion held within the glass. Any other method of removing a negative level (such as _[[spells/Restoration|restoration]]_) also frees a soul portion from the glass.

Once it imposes a temporary negative level on a creature, a _soultheft glass_ shows a ghostly reflection of that creature (though not any information about its surroundings) until all soul portions have been returned. If the victim dies, its soul portions fade after 24 hours. As a standard action, the _mirror_'s wielder can release all soul portions, which also removes the victim's negative levels.
