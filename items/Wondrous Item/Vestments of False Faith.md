Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "27000 gp"
Weight: "5 lbs."
Slot: "Body"
Caster level: "8"
Aura: "moderate illusion"
Description: |
  "This priestly garment can be commanded to alter its appearance as a standard action, able to reshape itself into ceremonial garb or the everyday habit of a religious functionary of any faith. _Vestments of false faith_ are always emblazoned with the holy symbol and colors of the faith chosen by the wearer, and she can disguise an object held in a hand as a holy symbol, censer, candle, or similar item of religious paraphernalia. This change is a visual illusion (glamer) effect akin to _disguise self_.
  The wearer of _vestments of false faith_ gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate a member of the faith she has chosen (this doesn't stack with _disguise self_ and similar effects). She also gains a +5 competence bonus on Use Magic Device checks to activate items that duplicate divine spells or emulate a specific religion or alignment, provided they fit the religion she's imitating. If she uses a magic item to produce the effect of a divine spell, she can make it appear to observers as though she were casting the spell, though a Spellcraft check to identify the spell being cast can identify it as coming from a magic item if the result exceeds the DC by 5 or more.
  The wearer's alignment is disguised while wearing _vestments of false faith_, so that it appears identical to that of the deity whose holy symbol she bears, and her aura is as strong as if she had a number of cleric levels equal to her Hit Dice. This primarily affects alignment detection; however, once per day as an immediate action, she can function as if she actually had that alignment when she would normally be affected by an alignment-based effect, such as _blasphemy, chaos hammer, forbiddance_, or an _unholy_ magic weapon. This effect persists until the end of the wearer's next turn, after which any non-instantaneous effects (such as _smite evil_) suddenly revert to having the effects they would normally have on a creature of her true alignment."
