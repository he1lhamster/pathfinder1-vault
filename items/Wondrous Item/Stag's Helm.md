Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "3500 gp"
Weight: "3 lbs."
Slot: "Head"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "faint divination"
Description: |
  "This striking helmet is crafted to resemble the skull of a mighty stag. Although made from bone, the antlers and helm are as strong as metal. When worn, the helm greatly enhances eyesight and hearing, granting a +2 competence bonus on Perception checks. In addition, once per day the helm may be called upon to enhance any ranged attack made by the wearer to make an insightful shot. Activating this ability is a free action, and once activated, your next ranged attack against a target within 30 feet is made as if that target were flat-footed against you—this allows a rogue to gain the benefit of sneak attack with this shot. If you don't make a ranged attack within 1 round of activating this power, the insight fades and is wasted for that day.
  A worshiper of Erastil who wears this helm may utilize the insightful shot ability up to 3 times per day."
