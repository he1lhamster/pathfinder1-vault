Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "–"
Weight: "160 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "15"
Aura: "strong necromancy"
Description: |
  "The _void crystal_ crackled into existence through interplanetary feedback between a device on Golarion—one of two linked magical rings—and a facility on Eox. The ring that's buried deep beneath the Dim Gate sits at the center of this great crystal, which shudders and expands in the collection chamber each time the proper alignment of celestial bodies comes to pass.
  The _void crystal_ is attuned to the creature that wears its _control ring_, which is inherently linked to the ring at the center of the crystal. As a move action, a creature wearing the ring can trigger the crystal to discharge negative energy. This discharge fills the chamber, and deals 150 points of negative energy damage (Will DC 20 half). Undead creatures in the area of the discharge are healed of 150 points of damage. The reservoirs in the Dim Gate usually contain enough energy to power this discharge three times per week.
  Also, a creature in control of the _void crystal_ can use its necromantic energy to raise any creature killed by the discharge as an undead creature as if using _animate dead_, _create undead_, or _create greater undead_. The creature in control of the _void crystal_ can control up to 30 HD of undead created in this manner.
  Finally, a creature in control of the _void crystal_ can use _dimension door_ at will to travel to the collection chamber or the Dim Gate's control room."
Destruction: |
  "The _void crystal_ can be destroyed by subjecting it to 16 continual hours of true sunlight without removing it from its receptacle in the collection chamber."

### Description

The _[[items/Wondrous Item/Void Crystal|void crystal]]_ crackled into existence through interplanetary feedback between a device on Golarion—one of two linked magical rings—and a facility on Eox. The ring that's buried deep beneath the Dim _[[spells/Gate|Gate]]_ sits at the center of this great crystal, which shudders and expands in the collection chamber each time the proper alignment of celestial bodies comes to pass.

The _void crystal_ is attuned to the creature that wears its control ring, which is inherently linked to the ring at the center of the crystal. As a move action, a creature wearing the ring can trigger the crystal to _[[spells/Discharge|discharge]]_ negative energy. This _discharge_ fills the chamber, and deals 150 points of negative energy damage (Will DC 20 half). Undead creatures in the area of the _discharge_ are healed of 150 points of damage. The reservoirs in the Dim _Gate_ usually contain enough energy to power this _discharge_ three times per week.

Also, a creature in control of the _void crystal_ can use its necromantic energy to raise any creature killed by the _discharge_ as an undead creature as if using _[[spells/Animate Dead|animate dead]]_, _[[spells/Create Undead|create undead]]_, or _[[spells/Create Greater Undead|create greater undead]]_. The creature in control of the _void crystal_ can control up to 30 HD of undead created in this manner.

Finally, a creature in control of the _void crystal_ can use _[[spells/Dimension Door|dimension door]]_ at will to travel to the collection chamber or the Dim _Gate_'s control room.

### _[[spells/Destruction|Destruction]]_

The _void crystal_ can be destroyed by subjecting it to 16 continual hours of true sunlight without removing it from its receptacle in the collection chamber.
