Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "4500 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Hands"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate conjuration"
Description: |
  "These gloves have a sapphire decorating each finger, bearing 10 in all. While wearing a pair of _first aid gloves_, as a standard action the wearer can cast any of the following spells (caster level 9th), permanently expending a number of sapphires equal to the spell's level (as denoted in parentheses after each spell): _breath of life_ (5), _cure critical wounds_ (4), _cure light wounds_ (1), _cure moderate wounds_ (2), _cure serious wounds_ (3), and _mass cure light wounds_ (5). When casting a spell from the gloves, the wearer can't expend sapphires on different hands; thus only a full hand's worth of gems can be used to cast _breath of life_ or _mass cure light wounds_. Regardless, both gloves must be worn to function. Once all of the sapphires are expended, a pair of _first aid gloves_ becomes nonmagical."
