Price: "16000 gp"
Weight: "4 lbs."
Slot: "Head"
Caster level: "6"
Aura: "moderate necromancy"
Description: |
  "This elaborate wooden mask is carved in the image of Pharasma. The owner of a _death mask_ can place the mask upon a corpse to ask the corpse up to three questions as if by _speak with dead_, except the corpse does not get a Will saving throw if the mask's owner is of a different alignment than the corpse had in life. This effect works as long as the head of the corpse is intact enough to fit the mask onto, no matter how damaged the corpse is otherwise. A _death mask_ functions on a given corpse only once in this way; additional attempts to ask the corpse questions fail.
  If a living person dons the _death mask_, her appearance changes to that of the last person whose corpse was spoken with using the mask, as _alter self_. The wearer resembles the deceased person as she looked in life."
