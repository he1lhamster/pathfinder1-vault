The mantle grants its wearer a +6 enhancement bonus to Wisdom, a +5 resistance bonus on all saving throws, and the ability to hide in plain sight as per the shadowdancer class feature. The wearer can speak with any shadow, in a way similar to the effects of the spell _stone tell_. Shadows willingly tell the wearer what dangers they obscure and what creatures have come in contact with them in the past 24 hours. The shadows can only relate information about creatures they've enshrouded. Creatures bearing a light source are not usually touched by shadows, though shadows can tell when they've been disrupted by passing light."
Destruction: |
  "The _Shredskin_ must be taken to the Positive Energy Plane or Sarenrae's domain on Nirvana and exposed to direct light for 1 month."
