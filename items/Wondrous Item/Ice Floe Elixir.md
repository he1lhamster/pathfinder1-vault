Weight: "–"
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "6"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "This chilled elixir usually takes the form of a pale blue liquid in a small glass vial coated in ice. Imbibing the elixir grants the drinker cold resistance 10 and the ability to merge with solid ice in the same fashion as _meld into stone_. These effects last for 1 hour.
  Alternatively, instead of drinking the ice floe elixir, the vial can be uncorked, releasing a cold, glowing vapor from the vial's mouth that coalesces around all living creatures within 30 feet. Creatures covered with the cloying vapor take a –20 penalty on Stealth checks and do not benefit from _blur_, _displacement_, _invisibility_, or similar effects for as long as they stay in the affected area. The vapor also reveals figments, _mirror images_, and _projected images_ in the area for what they really are. This effect lasts for 5 rounds before the vapor dissipates. This effect does not function in any environment already affected by fog, mist, or cloud-like effects."
