### Description

An ivory cameo depicting two elderly, bearded wizards with identical faces hangs on this amulet's delicate silver chain. Three times per day, when casting a spell with a verbal component, the wearer of an _[[items/Wondrous Item/Amulet of Reverse Incantation|amulet of reverse incantation]]_ can recite the spell's words backward as a free action in order to invert the spell's effect, as described below.

* If the wearer casts a spell that can counter or dispel another specific spell, she can activate the amulet to convert the spell being cast into the spell it specifically counters. For example, _[[spells/Haste|haste]]_ would become _[[spells/Slow|slow]]_, or _[[spells/Reduce Person|reduce person]]_ would become _[[spells/Enlarge Person|enlarge person]]_.
* If the wearer casts a spell that detects or affects creatures of a certain alignment, the spell instead affects creatures of the opposite alignment. For example, _[[spells/Chaos Hammer|chaos hammer]]_ would damage and blind chaotic creatures and outsiders instead of lawful ones.
* If the wearer casts a cure or inflict spell, she can activate the amulet to convert the spell being cast into the other type of the same spell level, such as converting _[[spells/Cure Moderate Wounds|cure moderate wounds]]_ into _[[spells/Inflict Moderate Wounds|inflict moderate wounds]]_.
