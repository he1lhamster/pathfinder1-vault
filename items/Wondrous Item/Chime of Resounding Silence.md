Caster level: "7"

Description: |
  "This foot-long tube of gold absorbs nearby sound when struck, as if it were the target of a _silence_ spell. This ability can be used once per day. The chime vibrates silently for the next 5 rounds, increasing in strength as time passes. On the bearer's turn each round there is a cumulative 20% chance that the chime prematurely ends the magical silence and releases the pent-up sound as a shout spell as a free action, oriented in a random direction. The bearer may spend a standard action to strike the vibrating chime again, ending its _silence_ early and unleashing the shout in a direction of his choosing. If dropped while vibrating, the chime automatically gains the broken condition and releases the shout effect in a random direction. A broken _chime of resounding silence_ cannot be used until it is repaired. The chime has no effect if struck in an area of _silence_ it did not create."
