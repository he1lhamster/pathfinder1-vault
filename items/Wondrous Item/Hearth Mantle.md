Title: "Hearth Mantle"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "3600 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Neck"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "faint abjuration, faint evocation"
Description: |
  "The inside of this long, thick shawl is cool muslin, while the outside is decorated with a flame-like rune. _Hearth mantles_ are favored by the faithful of Erastil, particularly those among his worshipers who rely upon the hunt for their livelihood. With a _hearth mantle_, one never has to worry about building a campfire in the wild.
  A _hearth mantle's_ wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on saving throws against fire-based effects; the mantle itself is immune to fire damage. Once per day, the wearer can cause the leather exterior of the mantle to smolder for 1 minute. While smoldering, the _hearth mantle_ sheds light as a torch.
  If the user takes a full-round action to carefully spread a _hearth mantle_ on the ground with its exterior facing up, a campfire ignites on the mantle's fire rune. This campfire burns for 8 hours and requires no fuel. Any creature that sleeps within 20 feet of the mantle for the full duration of the campfire recovers a number of hit points equal to twice its character level, as if it had undergone complete bed rest for a full 24 hours. The campfire is automatically extinguished if the _hearth mantle_ is picked up, but can also be extinguished through normal means."
Crafting cost: "1800 gp"
