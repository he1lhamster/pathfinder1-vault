Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "3"
Aura: "faint evocation"
Description: |
  "This piece of sooty coal has a tiny bit of flint embedded in it. The bearer of a _jumping cinder_ can, as a standard action, order it to burst into flames and bounce around in random directions. Each round, the _jumping cinder_ leaps into a randomly selected adjacent square. If a creature is in the square into which the _jumping cinder_ lands, that creature takes 1d6 points of fire damage if it fails a DC 12 Reflex save. After 1 minute, the _jumping cinder_ burns out, leaving behind a puff of smoke and a tiny smear of ash. Some goblin tribes use _jumping cinders_ to randomly select volunteers for undesirable duties from a large crowd of goblins—anyone who takes fire damage from the _jumping cinder_ but is not killed by the fire has to do the undesirable task."
