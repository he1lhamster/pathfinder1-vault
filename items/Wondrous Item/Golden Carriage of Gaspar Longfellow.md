Description: |
  "Crafted from the finest materials, the _Golden Carriage of Gaspar Longfellow_ is a vehicle fit for royalty. Larger than an average carriage, the _Golden Carriage_ can accommodate six occupants in the interior, as well as two drivers and a footman on the exterior. The interior is lavishly furnished and magically maintained—occupants are protected from extreme heat and cold as if under the effects of _endure elements_, and are treated as acclimated creatures for altitudes up to 15,000 feet (see altitude zones, _Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook_ 430). Both doors of the carriage are secured against intruders with _alarm_ and _arcane lock_ spells, and an invisible driver can control the reins as _unseen servant_ if no living driver is controlling the carriage.
  The most prominent features of the _Golden Carriage_ are the four spectral steeds that pull it. Adorned in beautiful scarlet leather harnesses, these gray horses pull the carriage tirelessly over nearly any terrain. These horses function as _phantom steed_ cast by a 12th-level caster, and grant their _air walk_, _water walk_, and other abilities to the carriage."
