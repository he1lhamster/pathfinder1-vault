  "This standard gold coin typically has two blank faces, but its owner can cause the holy symbol of Desna—a butterfly with the sun, the moon, and stars on its wings—to appear on either face at will. This proves especially useful when performing coin flips, as the owner of a Desna's coin can essentially guarantee that the result will end up in her favor.
  As one would expect of an item associated with the goddess of luck, a Desna's coin confers on its owner an uncanny ability to fortuitously avoid sudden threats. As a result, its bearer gains a +2 luck bonus on Reflex saving throws."
