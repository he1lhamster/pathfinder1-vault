Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "–"
Weight: "8 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "20"
Aura: "strong universal"
Description: |
  "The _tentacle of the Vaults_ is an artifact fashioned by the xiomorns from an aboleth tentacle to aid in their wars against the piscine masterminds. The tentacle is 8 feet in length and too rubbery and flexible to carry comfortably; humanoids find it more convenient to wear the _tentacle of the Vaults_ wrapped around the waist like a belt or over the shoulder as a sash, but no matter how the tentacle is worn, it does not occupy a magic item slot. The tentacle's owner can cast _dispel magic_ and _remove disease_ each five times per day.
  The tentacle's primary power activates when its owner tosses it onto the ground and speaks a command word as a standard action. The tentacle animates, transforming into a construct with the statistics listed in the paragraph below until the owner commands the construct to return to an inanimate tentacle as a free action. The construct obeys and serves its owner. It understands all languages spoken by its owner but does not speak. If the construct is destroyed, the artifact reverts to an inanimate tentacle that can be used again at a later time. The _tentacle of the Vaults_ can be animated for up to 1 hour each day. This time does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.
  When animated, the _tentacle of the Vaults_ has the statistics of a Medium animated object (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary_ 14) with a hardness of 20, the grab special attack, and the following special abilities.
  **Aboleth-Bane Aura (Su)** A magical aura extends in a 20-foot radius centered on the construct. All creatures within the aura, including the construct, gain a +8 bonus on attack rolls and melee damage rolls against aberrations. Any creature subject to a compulsion effect immediately receives another saving throw to break free from the effect (if one was allowed to begin with) when it enters the aura and at the start of its turn each round that it remains within the aura.
  **Dispel Illusion (Sp)** As a swift action, the construct can cast _dispel magic_ (CL 20th) on an illusion spell within 100 feet. This ability does not count against the number of uses of _dispel magic_ granted by the artifact."
Destruction: |
  "If the _tentacle of the Vaults_ is soaked in the necromantic fluids from the Vault called the Land of Black Blood and then used to cast remove disease on a mythic aboleth (_Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures_ 178) within 1 day, the mythic aboleth permanently loses its slime ability and the artifact is destroyed."

### Description

The _[[items/Wondrous Item/Tentacle of the Vaults|tentacle of the Vaults]]_ is an artifact fashioned by the xiomorns from an aboleth tentacle to aid in their wars against the piscine masterminds. The tentacle is 8 feet in length and too rubbery and flexible to carry comfortably; humanoids find it more convenient to wear the _tentacle of the Vaults_ wrapped around the waist like a belt or over the shoulder as a sash, but no matter how the tentacle is worn, it does not occupy a magic item slot. The tentacle's owner can cast _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ and _[[spells/Remove Disease|remove disease]]_ each five times per day.

The tentacle's primary power activates when its owner tosses it onto the ground and speaks a _[[spells/Command|command]]_ word as a standard action. The tentacle animates, transforming into a construct with the statistics listed in the paragraph below until the owner commands the construct to return to an inanimate tentacle as a free action. The construct obeys and serves its owner. It understands all languages spoken by its owner but does not speak. If the construct is destroyed, the artifact reverts to an inanimate tentacle that can be used again at a later time. The _tentacle of the Vaults_ can be _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Animated|animated]]_ for up to 1 hour each day. This time does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.

When _animated_, the _tentacle of the Vaults_ has the statistics of a _[[classes/Medium|Medium]]_ _[[monsters/Animated Object|animated object]]_ (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 14) with a hardness of 20, the _[[universal monster rules/Grab|grab]]_ special attack, and the following special abilities.

**Aboleth-Bane Aura (Su)** A magical aura extends in a 20-foot radius centered on the construct. All creatures within the aura, including the construct, gain a +8 bonus on attack rolls and melee damage rolls against aberrations. Any creature subject to a compulsion effect immediately receives another saving throw to break free from the effect (if one was allowed to begin with) when it enters the aura and at the start of its turn each round that it remains within the aura.

**Dispel Illusion (Sp)** As a swift action, the construct can cast _dispel magic_ (CL 20th) on an illusion spell within 100 feet. This ability does not count against the number of uses of _dispel magic_ granted by the artifact.

### _[[spells/Destruction|Destruction]]_

If the _tentacle of the Vaults_ is soaked in the necromantic fluids from the Vault _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ the Land of Black Blood and then used to cast _remove disease_ on a mythic aboleth (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 178) within 1 day, the mythic aboleth permanently loses its slime ability and the artifact is destroyed.
