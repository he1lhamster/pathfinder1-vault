Slot: "Shoulders"
Caster level: "20"
Aura: "overwhelming abjuration"
Description: |
  "Iomedae often grants the use of the _Stole of the Inheritor_ to her champions in times of great need. When draped across the shoulders, the stole grants DR 5/good, and it grants the use of _heal_ as a quickened spell-like ability once per day. Once per day, a good-aligned wearer of the _Stole of the Inheritor_ can cast _holy word_. In addition, as long as it is worn, the user can use _detect evil_ and _detect chaos_ at all times. A divine spellcaster who worships Iomedae gains a +2 sacred bonus on all saving throws while wearing the stole. The stole's greatest power, though, is allowing its wearer to use _plane shift_ on himself and any allies within 120 feet as an immediate action; the stole immediately returns to Iomedae's shoulders when this effect is used."
Destruction: |
  "A demon lord must adorn itself with the stole and use its _plane shift_ power to travel to Iomedae's court, whereupon anyone who pulls the stole from the Inheritor's shoulders can tear it apart while the demon lord remains alive and in Iomedae's presence."
