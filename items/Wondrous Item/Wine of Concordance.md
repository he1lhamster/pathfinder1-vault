Description: |
  "This sweet white wine contains notes of apple, lemon, and peach and is among the most citrus-flavored of the local wines produced in Caliphas. According to traditional legends, drinking glasses of _wine of concordance_ together can forge strong bonds between those individuals who share it, both emotionally and magically.
  Drinking a glass of _wine of concordance_ takes at least 1 round, though many imbibers take longer to savor the wine's fruity flavor. Creatures that each finish at least one glass of the wine while within 10 feet of each other become aware of each other, as per _status_ (each drinker is aware of the direction and distance to each other and any conditions affecting the others). In addition, while they're within 100 feet of each other, the drinkers share equally in any wounds they take, as per _shield other_. If a drinker moves more than 100 feet from any other drinker, the _shield other_ effect is suppressed, but it resumes functioning once the drinker moves within range again. These effects last for 3 hours. A bottle of _wine of concordance_ contains six glasses' worth of wine."
