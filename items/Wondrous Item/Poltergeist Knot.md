Description: |
  "This hopelessly knotted ball of golden twine defies any efforts to untangle it, forming new snarls out of nowhere just when it appears to be nearly unraveled.
  On command, the twine unrolls and snakes out through the air toward a target within 50 feet. Unless the target succeeds at a DC 13 Reflex save to avoid the _poltergeist knot_, at the twine's touch, the bindings of any containers the target is carrying (packs, pouches, sheaths, quivers, and so on) come undone and all their contents are swept up in a whirlwind, performing a madcap dance around the target's head.
  Anyone can grab an item as it spins by succeeding at a steal combat maneuver (_Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide_ 322) against a CMD of 12. In addition, the spinning objects obstruct the target's sight; other creatures gain concealment against attacks made by the target. The equipment moves with the victim, whirling around her head for 3 rounds before falling to the ground.
  A _poltergeist knot_ affects laces and buckles only on exterior containers—bottles in a pouch or a bag of caltrops in a backpack, for example, are swept into the whirlwind but don't spill their contents. The _poltergeist knot_ works on inanimate objects, but can't open locks. A creature who isn't carrying a significant amount of gear may be immune to the _poltergeist knot_ 's effect, at the GM's discretion.
  Once used, the knot loses its magic and becomes 50 feet of tangle, mundane twine."

### Description

This hopelessly knotted ball of golden twine defies any efforts to untangle it, forming new snarls out of nowhere just when it appears to be nearly unraveled.

On _[[spells/Command|command]]_, the twine unrolls and snakes out through the air toward a target within 50 feet. Unless the target succeeds at a DC 13 Reflex save to avoid the _[[items/Wondrous Item/Poltergeist Knot|poltergeist knot]]_, at the twine's touch, the bindings of any containers the target is carrying (packs, pouches, sheaths, quivers, and so on) come undone and all their contents are swept up in a _[[universal monster rules/Whirlwind|whirlwind]]_, performing a madcap dance around the target's head.

Anyone can _[[universal monster rules/Grab|grab]]_ an item as it spins by succeeding at a steal combat maneuver (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 322) against a CMD of 12. In addition, the spinning objects obstruct the target's sight; other creatures gain concealment against attacks made by the target. The equipment moves with the victim, whirling around her head for 3 rounds before falling to the ground.

A _poltergeist knot_ affects laces and buckles only on exterior containers—bottles in a pouch or a bag of _[[items/Mundane/Caltrops|caltrops]]_ in a backpack, for example, are swept into the _whirlwind_ but don't spill their contents. The _poltergeist knot_ works on inanimate objects, but can't open locks. A creature who isn't carrying a significant amount of gear may be immune to the _poltergeist knot_ 's effect, at the GM's discretion.

Once used, the knot loses its magic and becomes 50 feet of tangle, mundane twine.
