Description: |
  "Created by a race of unknown undersea creatures only passingly familiar with humanoid physiology, these tall, uncomfortable boots are made of slimy skin that wriggles slightly. The boots function as _slippers of the triton_, allowing the wearer to breathe and swim underwater. The boots constantly murmur telepathically to the wearer, alternating between sycophantic praise of the wearer's prowess and smug assurance that the boots will ensure that the wearer comes to no harm while underwater. The _unctuous waders_ urge the wearer to explore beneath the waves, hoping to find some clues as to their creators and purpose, which the boots have long ago forgotten. If the wearer goes for more than a week without submerging herself in the ocean, the unctuous waders become less obsequious and more demanding. The unctuous waders can remove the ability to allow the wielder to breathe underwater, which they might do as a threat to compel obedience, or out of mere petulance.
  Three times per day as a standard action, the unctuous waders can exude slimy water from the heels to propel the user, as the _slipstream_ spell."
