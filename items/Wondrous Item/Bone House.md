Description: |
  "A _bone house_ is a variant form of _instant fortress_ most often employed by elite agents of Nidal and influential members of Zon-Kuthon's faith. These grim statuettes appear as skull-topped fortresses the size of a clenched fist. When activated by speaking a command word, a _bone house_ grows to form a tower 20 feet square and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a crenellated battlement on top. The bone walls extend 10 feet into the ground, rooting it to the spot and preventing it from being tipped over. The fortress has a small door that opens only at the command of the owner of the fortress—even _knock_ spells can't open the door.
  The bone walls are magically enhanced to be as hard as stone, and have 100 hit points and hardness 10. A _bone house_ can be repaired by casting inflict spells on the walls, with every 10 points of negative energy repairing 1 point of damage. A _bone house_ springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the device's owner. The door opens and closes instantly at his command. People and creatures nearby (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the fortress's sudden growth. Anyone caught in the area takes 10d6 points of damage (DC 19 Reflex save for half damage). The interior of a _bone house_ is under the constant effects of a _desecrate_ spell and is considered an altar to Zon-Kuthon for the purposes of determining the _desecrate_ modifiers.
  Once a _bone house_ is expanded into tower size, its owner can create up to four mummies per month from the drifts of bone ash and detritus that litter the inner rooms. Creating a mummy in this manner takes 10 minutes, and the owner must be inside of the _bone house_ the entire time. Due to the _desecrate_ effect, mummies created inside gain +2 hit points per Hit Die. These undead guard the contents of the _bone house_ without needing to be commanded. If the owner wishes to command these mummies to perform other tasks, he must use other means to do so. No more than four mummies may be active at one time.
  A _bone house_ is deactivated by speaking a command word (different from the one used to activate it). It cannot be deactivated unless it is empty."
Destruction: |
  "A _bone house_ has hit points and hardness and can be destroyed largely by mundane means. However, to fully destroy a _bone house_, its final hit point must be taken by a positive energy effect, requiring a cure spell or similar effect to be cast on the nearly ruined structure."

### Description

A _[[items/Wondrous Item/Bone House|bone house]]_ is a variant form of _[[items/Wondrous Item/Instant Fortress|instant fortress]]_ most often employed by elite agents of Nidal and influential members of Zon-Kuthon's faith. These grim statuettes appear as skull-topped fortresses the size of a _[[spells/Clenched Fist|clenched fist]]_. When activated by speaking a _[[spells/Command|command]]_ word, a _bone house_ grows to form a tower 20 feet square and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a crenellated battlement on top. The bone walls extend 10 feet into the ground, rooting it to the spot and preventing it from being tipped over. The fortress has a small door that opens only at the _command_ of the owner of the fortress—even _[[spells/Knock|knock]]_ spells can't open the door.

The bone walls are magically enhanced to be as hard as stone, and have 100 hit points and hardness 10. A _bone house_ can be repaired by casting inflict spells on the walls, with every 10 points of negative energy repairing 1 point of damage. A _bone house_ springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the device's owner. The door opens and closes instantly at his _command_. People and creatures nearby (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the fortress's sudden growth. Anyone caught in the area takes 10d6 points of damage (DC 19 Reflex save for half damage). The interior of a _bone house_ is under the constant effects of a _[[spells/Desecrate|desecrate]]_ spell and is considered an altar to Zon-Kuthon for the purposes of determining the _desecrate_ modifiers.

Once a _bone house_ is expanded into tower size, its owner can create up to four mummies per month from the drifts of bone ash and detritus that litter the inner rooms. Creating a _[[monsters/Mummy|mummy]]_ in this manner takes 10 minutes, and the owner must be inside of the _bone house_ the entire time.
