Weight: "5 lbs."
Slot: "Head"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "This hide helm is a powerful variant of the more common _helm of the Mammoth Lord_. Like its lesser incarnation, a _greathelm of the Mammoth Lord_ is set with plates of ivory carved with runes, with a pair of tusks curving down either side of the wearer's face for cheek guards. The helm's tusks provide a gore attack dealing 1d8 points of damage for a Medium wearer (or 1d6 points of damage for a Small wearer) and count as magic and cold for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. The greathelm of the Mammoth Lord also protects the wearer from cold environments as per _endure elements_.
  Furthermore, it provides a +5 competence bonus on Handle Animal, Ride, and wild empathy checks with elephants, mammoths, mastodons, and other elephant-like creatures. On command, the wearer can use _detect animals or plants_ or _speak with animals_, but only to detect or communicate with elephant-like creatures. Once per day, the wearer can transform into a mammoth (treat as an mastodon) as _beast shape III_."
