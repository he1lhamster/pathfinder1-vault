### Description

Most bags of devouring appear to be normal sacks, but _[[items/Wondrous Item/Chomper|Chomper]]_ is unlike most bags of devouring. Sporting rows of _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_ teeth, a bad attitude, and a thirst to devour all things, this intelligent cursed item believes that it is the favored maw and most important appendage of a creature it mysteriously refers to as the Eater of All. _Chomper_ hates all creatures except for demons, whom it considers kindred spirits of _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_.

_Chomper_ has all of the magical abilities of a regular _[[items/Wondrous Item/Bag of Devouring|bag of devouring]]_, along with the following additional powers.

* As a standard action, _Chomper_'s possessor can swing the bag by its straps in an attempt to strike any single creature or unattended item within a 5-foot radius. _Chomper_ (not the wielder) can then make a single bite attack against the target. This bite has a +14 attack bonus and deals 1d10+5 points of damage plus 2 points of _[[universal monster rules/Bleed|bleed]]_ damage. This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Attacks made in this way are never modified by the wielder's abilities.
* When a non-demon is in _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_ of _Chomper_, the bag's cursed aura imparts a –1 penalty on all of its wielder's attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If _Chomper_ manages to gain dominance over a non-demon wielder through a personality conflict, it directs its bearer to seek out victims to feed to it.
