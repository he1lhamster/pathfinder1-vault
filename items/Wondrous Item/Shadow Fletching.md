  "These small black feathers appear to have been stripped off an arrow and crafted into a token. By braiding a _shadow fletching_ into her hair, a character can imbue herself with the magic of the Shadow Plane. Three times per day by touching the fletching as a swift action in an area of dim light or darkness, the wearer can enshroud her next ranged attack in shadowy extraplanar energy. As long as the wearer makes this attack before the end of her turn, the target of the attack is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC as if the attacker were invisible. This doesn't affect creatures with low-light vision, darkvision, or any ability that allows them to see invisible creatures."
