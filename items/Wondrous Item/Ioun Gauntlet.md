When the _detect magic_ effect is active, the gauntlet also sheds illumination as _light_ in the 60- foot cone of the _detect magic_ effect.
  An _ioun gauntlet_ features a single matrix in the back of the hand, suitable for one _ioun stone_. When an _ioun stone_ is inserted into the matrix as a standard action, the wearer gains the associated bonus from the _ioun stone_ as well an additional effect based on the shape of the _ioun stone_ inserted, as listed below. While a creature can put on two _ioun gauntlets_, the wearer gains the additional benefit from only one inserted _ioun stone_.
