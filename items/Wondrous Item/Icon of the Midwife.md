Description: |
  "This gray stone carving of a gaunt older woman is usually painted with black hair and black clothing with red trim. Once per day, the bearer can use it to cast _stabilize_, _resistance_, and _virtue_ —this is usually enough to ensure that a mother and newborn both live through a difficult birth.
  If Pharasma is the bearer's patron, the bearer can use the icon to cast _augury_ once per day. As a standard action, the bearer can touch a pregnant woman and know whether she is carrying a boy or girl and whether it will be a single birth or multiple. Once per day, the bearer can consecrate a corpse so if it is buried within 24 hours it cannot be reanimated as an undead."
