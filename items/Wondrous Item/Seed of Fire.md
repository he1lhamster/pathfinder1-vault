  "Created by the Empire of Cheliax as a weapon capable of scouring the battlefield in cleansing flame, this magic item consists of a pair of red gemstones. When the command word and a period of time is spoken into one of the gems, the other becomes permanently stationary and begins to glow with flame. When the period of time expires, the gemstone explodes, raining fire on a 60-foot square area directly below it. This fire deals 18d6 points of fire damage to all creatures and structures in the area. A DC 22 Reflex save halves this damage. Once activated, the seed can only be deactivated by destroying its partner gem (which destroys the item) or by speaking a special command word into the partner gem, which allows the _seed of fire_ to be reused."
