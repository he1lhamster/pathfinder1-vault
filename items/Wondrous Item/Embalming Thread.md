Weight: "–"
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "This coarse, acrid-smelling thread is more akin to wire than fabric. When carefully sewn into the body of a flesh golem or zombie (requiring 1 hour per Hit Die of the creature and a successful DC 20 Heal or Spellcraft check), the stitches change the creature's damage reduction to DR 5/ adamantine and slashing. Variant zombies lacking damage reduction (such as fast zombies) instead gain DR 5/slashing. One length of stitching is required for every Hit Die of the creature being enhanced. Using an insufficient number of lengths has no effect. A full thimble of _embalming thread_ contains 20 lengths.
  If the skill check to use the stitches fails, they are not wasted, but must first be cleaned and unknotted, requiring 1 hour per stitch. Once used successfully, the stitches cannot be reused."

This coarse, acrid-smelling thread is more akin to _[[items/Mundane/Wire|wire]]_ than fabric. When carefully sewn into the body of a flesh golem or zombie (requiring 1 hour per Hit Die of the creature and a successful DC 20 _[[spells/Heal|Heal]]_ or Spellcraft check), the stitches change the creature's _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_ to DR 5/ adamantine and slashing.
