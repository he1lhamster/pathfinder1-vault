Description: |
  "This small copper lantern always glows with a faint green light equivalent to a candle flame. If its reservoir is filled with oil as a full-round action, it burns with the normal intensity of a lamp for 6 hours. A creature filling the lantern can attune the _foxfire lantern_ to a specific creature type (such as aberrations or monstrous humanoids) with a successful DC 15 Knowledge check (appropriate to the creature type). Once the lantern is attuned, its green flame will change to red whenever creatures of that type approach within 50 feet. The creature filling the lantern can choose a more specific type of creature (such as green hags), but doing so increases the DC of the Knowledge check to 15 + the creature's CR."
