Description: |
  "When the Worldwound destroyed the nation of Sarkoris, the faithful of Iomedae seized upon the event as a balm against the horror of Aroden's death. The invention of the first _wardstones_, giant menhirs infused with holy magic meant to contain and repel demonic creatures, was perhaps the greatest result of the crusader's initial response to Sarkoris's destruction. Today, dozens of _wardstones_ stand sentinel along the borders of the Worldwound. The primary purpose of the _wardstones_ is to contain the growing influence of the Worldwound itself, but they also exude a powerful field similar to that generated by a _forbiddance_ spell. A single _wardstone_ exerts this aura in a 300-foot radius, but when multiple _wardstones_ are linked (as in the case of those running along the border of the Worldwound), they create a 300-footwide path of _forbiddance_, with the _wardstones_ running down the middle. The _forbiddance_ area, be it a radius or path, deals 12d6 points of damage per round to any demon within that area (DC 18 Will save half; spell resistance applies). Teleportation effects do not function in this zone at all. The _wardstones_ that bolster the eastern and southern borders of the Worldwound have a further effect as well—focused on the Worldwound as they are, they prevent demons from teleporting into or out of the Worldwound and effectively contain the threat. The arrangement of the _wardstones_ along the Mendev, Numeria, and Ustalav borders is such that even the unwarded borders to the west and north work to hamper demonic incursions."
Destruction: |
  "If a _wardstone_ misses its yearly maintenance ritual, it becomes vulnerable to damage. At this point, a _wardstone_ can be damaged by mortal attacks, but it still has hardness 25 and 500 hit points. If a _wardstone_ along a series of linked _wardstones_ is destroyed, the resulting "hole" in the path of the _forbiddance_ effect can be as narrow as a few dozen feet or as wide as several miles, depending upon numerous other variables (such as the terrain, the strength of the other _wardstones_, and other factors)."

### Description

When the Worldwound destroyed the nation of Sarkoris, the faithful of Iomedae seized upon the event as a balm against the horror of Aroden's death. The invention of the first wardstones, giant menhirs infused with holy magic meant to contain and repel demonic creatures, was perhaps the greatest result of the crusader's initial response to Sarkoris's _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_. Today, dozens of wardstones stand sentinel along the borders of the Worldwound. The primary purpose of the wardstones is to contain the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Growing|growing]]_ influence of the Worldwound itself, but they also exude a powerful field similar to that generated by a _[[spells/Forbiddance|forbiddance]]_ spell. A single _[[items/Wondrous Item/Wardstone|wardstone]]_ exerts this aura in a 300-foot radius, but when multiple wardstones are linked (as in the case of those running along the border of the Worldwound), they create a 300-footwide path of _forbiddance_, with the wardstones running down the middle. The _forbiddance_ area, be it a radius or path, deals 12d6 points of damage per round to any demon within that area (DC 18 Will save half; _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ applies). Teleportation effects do not function in this zone at all. The wardstones that bolster the eastern and southern borders of the Worldwound have a further effect as well—focused on the Worldwound as they are, they prevent demons from teleporting into or out of the Worldwound and effectively contain the threat. The arrangement of the wardstones along the Mendev, Numeria, and Ustalav borders is such that even the unwarded borders to the west and north work to hamper demonic incursions.

### _Destruction_

If a _wardstone_ misses its yearly maintenance ritual, it becomes vulnerable to damage. At this point, a _wardstone_ can be damaged by mortal attacks, but it still has hardness 25 and 500 hit points. If a _wardstone_ along a series of linked wardstones is destroyed, the resulting "hole" in the path of the _forbiddance_ effect can be as narrow as a few dozen feet or as wide as several miles, depending upon numerous other variables (such as the terrain, the strength of the other wardstones, and other factors).
