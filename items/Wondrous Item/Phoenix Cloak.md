Price: "55000 gp"
Weight: "7 lbs."
Slot: "Shoulders"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "This cloak is made of tough leather, and is decorated with brilliant red and orange feathers. As a free action, the wearer can rub her hands together, setting them alight—thus granting her natural attacks and unarmed strikes the burn special ability (_Bestiary_ 298; 1d6, Reflex DC 14). The wearer can use this ability for up to 10 rounds per day, which don't need to be consecutive.
  If the wearer takes damage that would reduce her below 0 hit points, she can expend one use of mythic power to transform into a phoenix-like being. This doesn't require an action. When this happens, she is immediately affected as though targeted with a _breath of life_ spell (CL 9th) and polymorphs into a birdlike creature made of flames (as _elemental body II_, CL 9; fire elemental only). While in this form, the wearer also gains a fly speed of 50 feet with good maneuverability, as well as a +4 bonus on Fly skill checks due to this maneuverability."
