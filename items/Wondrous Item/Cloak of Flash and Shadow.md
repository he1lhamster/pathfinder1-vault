  When worn inside-out, the matte-black lining seems to absorb light, cloaking you in shadow and giving you a +2 competence bonus on Stealth checks. In this configuration you can cast _blur_ three times per day.
  Reversing the cloak's position is a standard action and requires at least one free hand."
