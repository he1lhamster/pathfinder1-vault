Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "4000 gp"
Weight: "5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate conjuration"
Description: |
  "This rugged backpack is identical to a _handy haversack_ in most regards, with numerous compartments for storing items. Any effort to identify it with a Spellcraft check result ranging from 24 to 33 by someone unfamiliar with its special properties reveals it to be a _handy haversack_. A result below 24 does not identify any magic properties, while a result of 34 or higher reveals its additional secret properties. It has two hidden compartments (Perception DC 35), each able to store up to 1 cubic foot of material or 10 pounds in weight. In addition, the entire item is reinforced with thin mithral fibers, giving it a hardness of 15 and 5 hit points. Each compartment has a concealed superior lock (Perception DC 35, Disable Device DC 40) built in to prevent unauthorized access. When a compartment is locked, an item can still be removed from it as a move action by a character who has a key to the lock, like a normal _handy haversack_. The keys are not magical and can be crafted (Craft DC 25) by a character able to disable the existing locks and who has at least 5 ranks in Craft (locks). Each _secure paypack_ is normally created with two keys."
