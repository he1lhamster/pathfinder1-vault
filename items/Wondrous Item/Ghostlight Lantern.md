Title: "Ghostlight Lantern"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "7000 gp"
Weight: "3 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "moderate evocation"
Description: |
  "This brass bullseye lantern is embossed with dancing orbs flitting amid a leaf-and-holly motif. A _ghostlight lantern_ functions as a normal bullseye lantern, but if the remains of a dead will-o'-wisp are placed inside it, the lantern gains additional abilities. The dead will-o'-wisp powers the lantern for a period of 1 week, during which time the lantern sheds a bluish-white light without the need for oil as fuel. Creatures within the 60-foot cone of the lantern's normal light are outlined with a pale, bluish glow, as _faerie fire_. Orcs within the cone are dazzled, as if in bright sunlight, for as long as they remain within the light. Additionally, three times per day as a standard action, the wielder of a _ghostlight lantern_ can draw upon the power of the deceased will-o'- wisp fueling it to cast _shocking grasp_. Lastly, while within the bounds of Ghostlight Marsh in the Hold of Belkzen, a _ghostlight lantern_ unerringly emits a beacon that illuminates a direct path to the circle of standing stones that form the entrance to the Vault of Thorns. After 1 week, the power of the deceased aberration is exhausted, and the _ghostlight lantern_ loses its additional abilities, once again functioning only as a normal bullseye lantern until another dead will-o'-wisp is placed inside."
