While in this form, the wearer gains a +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple or pin a foe. Once a foe is grappled, the wearer can constrict the opponent with any successful subsequent grapple checks, dealing an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 + her Strength modifier, if Medium (1d6 if Small). The snake form lasts until another command is given, or for a maximum of 10 minutes, whichever is shorter."
