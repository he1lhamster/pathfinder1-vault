On command, by passing the edge of the cloak over her face, the wearer may remove a mundane disguise (one applied with the Disguise skill) and store it in the cloak. This does not change the cloak's appearance in any way. Once a disguise is stored in the cloak, it can be reapplied to the wearer who placed it within the cloak on command, using the original result of the Disguise check. The cloak can store up to three disguises at once, and any wearer of the cloak can discard any number of disguises within the cloak as a free action."
