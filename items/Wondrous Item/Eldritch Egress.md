Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "10000 gp"
Weight: "4 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "This cunningly designed bundle of wooden slats unfolds and interlocks to form a 3-foot-by-3-foot frame. Once per day you may place the unfolded frame upon a solid surface to form a passage up to 10 feet deep, as if using a _passwall_ spell. The passageway lasts for 1 hour unless the frame is removed earlier.
  Folding or unfolding the frame is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Using the unfolded frame to create a passage is a standard action. Medium or smaller creatures can easily pass through the tunnel, while Large creatures require an Escape Artist check. The _eldritch egress_ can only be removed from outside the surface it was placed on, so careful planning is required when using it."
