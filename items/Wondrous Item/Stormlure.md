Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "5400 gp"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Neck"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "faint evocation"
Description: |
  "A stormlure is usually fashioned from pieces of creatures known for their affinity to air—the feathers of birds, the shells of flying insects, and the scales of a dragon. When activated, stormlures call to the wind, causing a tempestuous gale. Once per day on command, the wearer of a stormlure is surrounding by swirling winds for 1 minute, granting a 50% miss chance against all ranged attacks, including rays and other ranged spells that require a roll to hit. This wind does not hinder the wearer of the _stormlure_ in any way. At any one time during this duration, as a swift action, the wearer can cause the air around her to fill with crackling lightning, dealing 4d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures adjacent to her. A DC 14 Reflex save halves this damage."
