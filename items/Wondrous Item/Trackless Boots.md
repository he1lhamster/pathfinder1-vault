Description: |
  "Leaving marks of your passage can alert predators that a newcomer has entered their territory. _Trackless boots_ help prevent you from making too much noise as you creep along, and they also mask traces of your passage through underground caverns to prevent your enemies from finding you. These boots are particularly valued by smugglers who work in patrolled areas.
  _Trackless boots_ are soft, well-worn leather boots with thin soles. The softness of the boots' soles add a +4 competence bonus on Move Silently checks. In addition, the boots conceal your passage much like the _pass without trace_ spell—you leave no trail underground and cannot be tracked."
