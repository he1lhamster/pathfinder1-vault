  "Once per day, the bearer of the _Fluttered Wing_ can quietly and soothingly converse with a creature that is at least indifferent toward it. While the bearer does so, she gains a +10 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks against that target. At any point during the conversation, she can cast _suggestion_ on the target. When she does so, she can attempt a Bluff check to hide the act of casting the spell as mere words, gaining a +10 bonus on this check; an observer realizes she's casting _suggestion_ only if the result of his own Sense Motive check exceeds the result of this Bluff check.
  A character who carries the _Fluttered Wing_ is not affected by effects that detect or reveal falsehoods unless those effects come from 8th- or 9th-level spells."
Destruction: |
  "If the Fluttered Wing is bathed in the blood of an innocent while lies about that innocent are chanted aloud for 30 minutes, it crumbles into ash."
