Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "12000 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate divination"
Description: |
  "A set of _lithomancy stones_ contains 15 semi-precious stones of varying shape and color, representing a mixture of elements, emotions, and various spiritual presences from the outer planes. Once per day, the possessor of a set of lithomancy stones can frame a question in her mind, cast the stones upon the ground, and attempt a reading with a Knowledge (planes) check to find the answer to her question. The check takes 1 minute, and the DC depends on the time frame of the question. The DC for a question regarding the next 30 minutes is 20. A question regarding the next day has a DC of 30, and a question about the next week has a DC of 40. The GM rolls the check in secret. If the possessor fails the check by 5 or more, she receives a false or misleading reading. If the possessor fails the check by less than 5, it yields no result. A successful check reveals information similar to that gained through a successful _augury_ (for a reading about the next 30 minutes) or _divination_ (for longer readings), which is communicated by the relative position of the stones.
  In addition to this function, _lithomancy stones_ can be used as an additional focus for _augury_, _divination_, or similar spells to increase the chance of receiving correct information by 10% (to a maximum of 90%)."
