Title: "Horn of Plenty"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "6500 gp"
Weight: "3 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate enchantment"
Description: |
  "This hollowed-out horn comes in four varieties: a _horn of plentiful goods_, a _horn of plentiful labor_, a _horn of plentiful influence_, and a _horn of plentiful magic_. Each variety carries the same construction requirements but offers a different benefit. The horn's type must be determined at creation and cannot later be changed. If the horn is random, roll a d4 to determine which type of horn it is.
  A _horn of plenty_ may be blown once per week of downtime to improve the rate at which its bearer can exchange capital. On command, a _horn of plentiful goods_, _labor_, or _influence_ allows a creature to trade any 2 points of a single type of capital in exchange for 1 point of either Goods, Labor, or Influence, as indicated by the item's name. (For instance, a _horn of plentiful goods_ allows a creature to trade 2 points of any one kind of capital for 1 point of Goods.) This effect lasts for 1 day. If you are already trading two single types of capital for one other type of capital, at the GM's discretion, blowing the horn allows you to trade on a 1-to-1 basis.
  A _horn of plentiful magic_ acts similarly to the aforementioned horns, but instead allows a character to trade 3 points of either Goods, Labor, or Influence for 1 point of Magic."
