Price: "5040 gp"
Weight: "7 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate abjuration"
Description: |
  "This magical standard appears to be a rather plain banner of nondescript canvas cloth, but on command it takes on the device or pattern chosen by the person using it. Once per day when the banner is planted firmly in the ground, it creates a calm and comfortable environment in a 20-foot radius from the banner, granting those within the area the benefits of _endure elements_. This area of calm and comfort can even resist magical weather effects, but only if those effects are of a caster level lower than that of the banner.
  Also, the banner wards the area of calm and comfort as if by an _alarm_ spell (audible alarm). The creature that plants the banner into the ground chooses the password upon doing so. The area created by the banner lasts for 8 hours or until the banner is taken out of the ground."
