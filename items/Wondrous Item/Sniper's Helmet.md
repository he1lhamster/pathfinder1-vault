Description: |
  "A _sniper's helmet_ looks like the simple steel soldier's helmet common to the European trenches of the First World War, with the addition of a steel eye shield. Once per day, the wearer of a _sniper's helmet_ can, as a standard action, denote one creature within her line of sight as her target. The wearer can perceive the target when it is invisible or ethereal as though using the _see invisibility_ spell, and gains a +20 competence bonus on Perception checks to locate the target. The wearer ignores concealment provided by fog or mist, _blur_, _displacement_, _invisibility_, and similar effects affecting the target, but not concealment provided by darkness. These bonuses last for 5 minutes or until the target creature is dead. The _sniper's helmet_ provides no benefits to the wearer's allies, and the wearer gains no benefits against creatures other than her chosen target.
  In addition, once per day, the wearer of a _sniper's helmet_ can create a magical sensor up to 600 feet above her that gives her a full 360-degree viewpoint as if she were actually there. The wearer perceives with her normal visual senses, and though the sensor cannot penetrate solid surfaces, it is unaffected by foliage and the like."
