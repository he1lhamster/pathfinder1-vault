Title: "Swarmlord's Jar"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "3000 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate conjuration"
Description: |
  "This small, lidded jar contains a sizable deformed insect that twitches and wriggles as if constantly undergoing a particularly painful death. A _swarmlord's jar_ has a lid, but the lid is fused to the rest of the jar and cannot be opened. While a _swarmlord's jar_ is carried openly in one hand, it grants a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws attempted against the attacks of swarms, and reduces swarm damage taken by the target by 5 points. These effects do not stack if more than one jar is carried.
  A _swarmlord's jar_ can be thrown to shatter at any point within 30 feet. If the jar shatters in a square that isn't currently occupied by an existing swarm, it creates a locust swarm (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4_ 183) that follows the thrower's mental commands; these commands may be issued as a free action. If the jar shatters in a square occupied by a swarm, the swarm must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become controlled by the thrower. Issuing mental commands to a swarm (whether it's a freshly created locust swarm or a controlled swarm) is a move action, but once the swarm has been issued orders, it continues to follow those orders until it's destroyed or the magic of the _swarmlord's jar_ ends. A locust swarm created by this item lasts for 1 minute if not destroyed earlier. Likewise, control granted by the jar lasts for 1 minute. Used against a worm that walks, a _swarmlord's jar_ merely deals 6d6 points of damage on a successful touch attack as it shatters (Will DC 15 half)."

### Description

This small, lidded jar contains a sizable deformed insect that twitches and wriggles as if constantly undergoing a particularly painful death. A _[[items/Wondrous Item/Swarmlord's Jar|swarmlord's jar]]_ has a lid, but the lid is fused to the rest of the jar and cannot be opened. While a _swarmlord's jar_ is carried openly in one hand, it grants a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws attempted against the attacks of swarms, and reduces swarm damage taken by the target by 5 points. These effects do not stack if more than one jar is carried.

A _swarmlord's jar_ can be thrown to _[[spells/Shatter|shatter]]_ at any point within 30 feet. If the jar shatters in a square that isn't currently occupied by an existing swarm, it creates a locust swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 183) that follows the thrower's mental commands; these commands may be issued as a free action. If the jar shatters in a square occupied by a swarm, the swarm must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become controlled by the thrower. Issuing mental commands to a swarm (whether it's a freshly created locust swarm or a controlled swarm) is a move action, but once the swarm has been issued orders, it continues to follow those orders until it's destroyed or the magic of the _swarmlord's jar_ ends. A locust swarm created by this item lasts for 1 minute if not destroyed earlier. Likewise, control granted by the jar lasts for 1 minute. Used against a _[[monsters/Worm That Walks|worm that walks]]_, a _swarmlord's jar_ merely deals 6d6 points of damage on a successful touch attack as it shatters (Will DC 15 half).
