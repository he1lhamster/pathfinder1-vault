Price: "2500 gp"

Slot: "Hands"
Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate necromancy"
Description: |
  "This thin disk of woven material is 2-1/2 inches in diameter. From its edges protrude fine, hair-like fibers about half an inch long. A _touch of avolition_ is in fact an example of migo technology—as much fungus as anything else. Creatures like mi-go can handle a _touch of avolition_ with ease, but humanoids and other fleshy users must wear gloves to avoid becoming the target of the item's effect. Applying a _touch of avolition_ requires a successful touch attack. When placed against flesh (any living, corporeal, non-plant or non-ooze creature), a _touch of avolition's_ fibers swiftly merge with the target unless the creature succeeds at a DC 15 Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim becomes paralyzed for 7 rounds. It can attempt a new Fortitude as a standard action after the first round to end the effect early.
  Once a victim recovers from the paralysis effect, the _touch of avolition_ saps the user's willpower and dulls the senses, making creatures under these effects easier to mentally manipulate. The victim's Wisdom is reduced by 6 (minimum 1) as long as the _touch of avolition_ remains attached. The fungal filaments of a _touch of avolition_ dig deep, and merely ripping the patch free from the skin doesn't remove this Wisdom penalty, though the removal itself deals 1d4 points of damage to the victim. The effect is a curse effect, and it (and the paralysis) can be removed as such via _remove curse_ or similar spells.
  A _touch of avolition_ works best when damp. The save DC to resist a dry _touch of avolition_ is 10, its paralysis effect lasts for only 2 rounds, and its Wisdom penalty is reduced to 2. The effects of multiple _touches of avolition_ do not stack."

### Description

This thin disk of woven material is 2-1/2 inches in diameter. From its edges protrude fine, hair-like fibers about half an inch long. A _[[items/Wondrous Item/Touch of Avolition|touch of avolition]]_ is in fact an example of migo technology—as much fungus as anything else. Creatures like _[[monsters/Mi-go|mi-go]]_ can handle a _touch of avolition_ with ease, but humanoids and other fleshy users must wear gloves to avoid becoming the target of the item's effect. Applying a _touch of avolition_ requires a successful touch attack. When placed against flesh (any living, corporeal, non-plant or non-ooze creature), a _touch of avolition_'s fibers swiftly merge with the target unless the creature succeeds at a DC 15 Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim becomes _[[conditions/Paralyzed|paralyzed]]_ for 7 rounds. It can attempt a new Fortitude as a standard action after the first round to end the effect early.

Once a victim recovers from the _[[universal monster rules/Paralysis|paralysis]]_ effect, the _touch of avolition_ saps the user's willpower and dulls the senses, making creatures under these effects easier to mentally manipulate. The victim's Wisdom is reduced by 6 (minimum 1) as long as the _touch of avolition_ remains attached. The fungal filaments of a _touch of avolition_ dig deep, and merely ripping the patch free from the skin doesn't remove this Wisdom penalty, though the removal itself deals 1d4 points of damage to the victim. The effect is a curse effect, and it (and the _paralysis_) can be removed as such via _[[spells/Remove Curse|remove curse]]_ or similar spells.

A _touch of avolition_ works best when damp. The save DC to resist a dry _touch of avolition_ is 10, its _paralysis_ effect lasts for only 2 rounds, and its Wisdom penalty is reduced to 2. The effects of multiple touches of avolition do not stack.
