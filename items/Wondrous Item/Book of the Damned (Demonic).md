The user gains a +4 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks if she uses the book as a resource (consulting it for at least an hour regarding a question), and its descriptions of the Abyss are so accurate that any teleportation travel to or within the Abyss always brings the caster to the exact location desired (no familiarity roll required).
  The demonic section of the _Book of the Damned_ serves as the focal point for an _unhallow_ effect and _sympathy_ attuned to attract chaotic evil creatures. As long as the book's owner is carrying it, she casts evil spells as if she were 2 caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on Charisma-based skills and checks when interacting with chaotic evil creatures (these bonuses are considered to be profane bonuses and do not stack with similar bonuses granted by other partial copies of the _Book of the Damned_). Three times per day, the tome can be used to cast one of the following spells: _blasphemy_, _desecrate_, _greater planar binding_, _insanity_, _rift of ruin_, _summon monster VII_, or _unholy blight_. Once per day as a standard action, the bearer can use the book to gain one of the boons granted by any demon lord, which lasts as long as the owner retains possession of the book or until she chooses a new boon. This does not require an obedience."
Destruction: |
  "The demonic _Book of the Damned_ can be destroyed by feeding the pages to a lawful or good outsider (though doing so usually results in the outsider's death or fall from grace). Unless the other three portions of the _Book of the Damned_ are also destroyed within 24 hours, the demonic _Book of the Damned_ reappears unharmed at some random, obscure point in the multiverse."
