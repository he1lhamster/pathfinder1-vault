Title: "Harvesting Lens"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "5400 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "3"
Aura: "faint evocation"
Description: |
  "This thick, intricate lens piece is covered in alchemical wiring. A small aperture on the side of the lens connects to a mundane glass vial, such as a vial used for potions. When slid onto the viewer's end of a telescope, a _harvesting lens_ allows the telescope's user to harness the power of starlight or the void as she chooses.
  When a vial is fitted to the lens and the telescope is aimed at a distant star in the night sky, the vial slowly fills with collected starlight. After 8 hours, the vial is filled with silvery liquid cosmic light. One filled and removed, the vial of starlight sheds light for 8 hours, as if it were affected by _light_. During this time, the vial can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. On a direct hit, the vial shatters in a blinding flash of light, affecting the target as a _blinding ray_ (Fortitude DC 13 negates). If the vial misses, it breaks with no effect. Either way, a new empty vial must be attached to the harvesting lens to use it again.
  Alternatively, a _harvesting lens_ attached to a telescope can be pointed toward an empty, dark space between the stars. After 8 hours, the vial becomes full of thick, inky dark matter. For 8 hours after the vial of dark matter is filled and removed, an inky black haze surrounds any creature holding it, as the _protective penumbra_ spell. A vial of dark matter can also be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Upon striking any solid body or surface, the vial breaks and releases a 10-footradius emanation of magical darkness that lasts for 3 minutes. This effect otherwise acts as _darkness_.
  Only vials that have been filled for 8 hours produce the above effects. Partially filled vials do not work.
  Only one magical lens (such as this or a _lens of starlight_) can be attached to a telescope at a time."

### Description

This thick, intricate lens piece is covered in alchemical wiring. A small aperture on the side of the lens connects to a mundane glass _[[items/Mundane/Vial|vial]]_, such as a _vial_ used for potions. When slid onto the viewer's end of a telescope, a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Harvesting Lens|harvesting lens]]_ allows the telescope's user to harness the power of starlight or the void as she chooses.

When a _vial_ is fitted to the lens and the telescope is aimed at a distant star in the night sky, the _vial_ slowly fills with collected starlight. After 8 hours, the _vial_ is filled with silvery liquid cosmic light. One filled and removed, the _vial_ of starlight sheds light for 8 hours, as if it were affected by light. During this time, the _vial_ can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. On a direct hit, the _vial_ shatters in a _[[feats/Blinding Flash|blinding flash]]_ of light, affecting the target as a _[[spells/Blinding Ray|blinding ray]]_ (Fortitude DC 13 negates). If the _vial_ misses, it breaks with no effect. Either way, a new empty _vial_ must be attached to the _harvesting lens_ to use it again.

Alternatively, a _harvesting lens_ attached to a telescope can be pointed toward an empty, dark space between the stars. After 8 hours, the _vial_ becomes full of thick, inky dark matter. For 8 hours after the _vial_ of dark matter is filled and removed, an inky black haze surrounds any creature holding it, as the _[[spells/Protective Penumbra|protective penumbra]]_ spell. A _vial_ of dark matter can also be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Upon striking any solid body or surface, the _vial_ breaks and releases a 10-footradius emanation of magical _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_ that lasts for 3 minutes. This effect otherwise acts as _darkness_.

Only vials that have been filled for 8 hours produce the above effects. Partially filled vials do not work.

Only one magical lens (such as this or a lens of starlight) can be attached to a telescope at a time.
