Description: |
  "These wrist wraps are actually dark, thorny vines that constantly move and twist around the wearer's hands of their own accord. The wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on combat maneuver checks to disarm, grapple, and steal. Once per day when the wearer successfully pins a foe with a grapple check, the vines can move off the wearer (ending the circumstance bonus on combat maneuver checks), envelop the target, and tie it up. A tied-up victim can escape the vines by succeeding at a combat maneuver or Escape Artist check with a DC equal to the result of the combat maneuver check that pinned the victim. The character who was wearing the gauntlets when they were used to envelop a target can remove them from the target as a move action. Any other creature must succeed at a combat maneuver or Strength check at the same DC to pry the gauntlets loose of an enveloped target."
