Description: |
  "This heavy leather belt is reinforced with metal and detailed to resemble a gut wound that has sprouted teeth. In addition to functioning as a _belt of mighty constitution +2_, the mouth on the belt animates whenever the wearer gains the grappled condition, damaging the wearer's opponent as if it were armor spikes (1d6 points of damage for a Medium wearer, 1d4 for Small). Similar to armor spikes, the mouth can be made into a magic weapon in its own right; it can also be temporarily enhanced with magic such as _magic weapon_. The wearer can use the mouth to eat meat, gaining nutrition from it as if he had eaten with his own mouth (the mouth refuses any food other than meat)."
