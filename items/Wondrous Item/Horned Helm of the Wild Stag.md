Title: "Horned Helm of the Wild Stag"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "14000 gp"
Weight: "3 lbs."
Slot: "Head"
Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "Numerous antlers protrude from this ornate leather helm, creating an impressive array of bony points that jut out in several directions. When the _horned helm of the wild stag_ is donned, the wearer's facial structure subtly elongates in a manner reminiscent of a stag's head. He gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity.
  Once per day when the wearer charges an enemy or attempts an overrun combat maneuver, he can as part of his action activate the helm to summon dozens of spectral stags to accompany him during his movement. These ghostly stags gallop around him in a frenzy, with the unmistakable sound of pounding hooves, and stampede through any creature within 5 feet of the wearer at any point during his movement. Although this stampede causes no physical damage, each affected creature must attempt a DC 16 Will save to avoid being overcome by the frenzy of the rampaging herd. A creature that fails this save must use its next turn to charge the nearest valid target (including its allies), if possible. Creatures that are unable to charge must instead move away from the wearer of the helm as quickly as possible on their next turn. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect."
