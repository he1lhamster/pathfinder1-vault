  "This delicate fan is made of dried leaves and thin twigs. Three times per day as a standard action, the wielder can wave the fan to summon forth a 30-foot cone of swirling red and gold leaves that lasts for 3 rounds. This area acts as _obscuring mist_, except for the duration and the fact it is composed of leaves rather than fog (thus, creatures able to see through mist and fog can't see through the _fan of autumn's_ concealment). As long as the wielder has the fan in her hand, the leaves don't obscure her vision."
