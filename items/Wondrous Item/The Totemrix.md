Description: |
  "The _Totemrix_ is the dark half of the _Aohl_, an artifact gifted to the lost Jaytirian Society of the Mwangi Expanse following a sacred truce between their two feuding gods. The _Totemrix_ is a manifestation of power from the now-dead demon lord of shadows, Vyriavaxus. It's a DC 30 Knowledge (religion) check to know this, but any evilaligned creature that touches the _Totemrix_ immediately knows the name and how to use the artifact's powers. The _Totemrix_ constantly emits _darkness_, as per the spell of the same name, reducing illumination levels in a 20-foot radius by one step.
  As long as the _Totemrix_ is carried, the wielder's demeanor and attitude become increasingly morbid. After a day of keeping the _Totemrix_ in his possession, its owner becomes incredibly possessive of the artifact and will not voluntarily relinquish it—if the wielder loses possession of the _Totemrix_, he becomes obsessed with recovering it. Every day that the owner maintains possession of the _Totemrix_, he gains 1 "shadow point." When the owner's shadow point total equals his experience level, he must make a DC 25 Fortitude save. Regardless of the results of this save, the owner dies—if the Fortitude save is a success, though, he rises the next evening as a vampire. If a player character succumbs to this potent curse and becomes a vampire, you should assume control of that PC until the other characters can defeat him and, hopefully, resurrect him. The compulsion to maintain ownership of the _Totemrix_ is a curse that functions at CL 15th.
  A vampire created in this manner continues to covet the _Totemrix_, and indeed, if separated from its ownership (or unable to benefit from its power, as in the case of it being joined to the _Morrowfall_), suffers a –4 penalty on all skill checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until he recovers the artifact.
  In the hands of a vampire, the _Totemrix_ gains a potent new ability—when the vampire uses his children of the night ability, he may call upon shadow beasts. When he calls upon shadow beasts, he calls 2d6 shadowgarms (see _Pathfinder Adventure Path_ volume #25), 1d4 shadow rat swarms (see page 37), 1d4+1 shadows, or 1d3 shadow mastiffs (see page 31). Although the vampire can only do so as often as he can use children of the night (once a day for most vampires), shadow beasts called in this manner persist in the area and follow the vampire's last command until they are slain or banished. At any one time, a vampiric wielder of the _Totemrix_ can maintain a number of shadow beasts equal to the amount of spawn he can control (up to 52 at a time for Ilnerik); attempts to call more shadow beasts while this total number is maxed still function, but the called shadow beasts persist for only up to 1 hour before vanishing."
Destruction: |
  "When the _Totemrix_ is joined with its counterpart, the _Morrowfall_, its powers (as well as those of the _Morrowfall_) are suppressed. In this state, both it and the _Morrowfall_ can be destroyed by anything capable of destroying a magic metal object of its size."

### Description

_[[items/Wondrous Item/The Totemrix|The Totemrix]]_ is the dark half of the Aohl, an artifact gifted to the lost Jaytirian Society of the Mwangi Expanse following a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sacred|sacred]]_ truce between their two feuding gods. _The Totemrix_ is a manifestation of power from the now-dead demon lord of shadows, Vyriavaxus. It's a DC 30 Knowledge (religion) check to know this, but any evilaligned creature that touches _the Totemrix_ immediately knows the name and how to use the artifact's powers. _The Totemrix_ constantly emits _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_, as per the spell of the same name, reducing illumination levels in a 20-foot radius by one step.

As long as _the Totemrix_ is carried, the wielder's demeanor and attitude become increasingly morbid. After a day of keeping _the Totemrix_ in his _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_, its owner becomes incredibly possessive of the artifact and will not voluntarily relinquish it—if the wielder loses _possession_ of _the Totemrix_, he becomes obsessed with recovering it. Every day that the owner maintains _possession_ of _the Totemrix_, he gains 1 "_[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|shadow]]_ point." When the owner's _shadow_ point total equals his experience level, he must make a DC 25 Fortitude save. Regardless of the results of this save, the owner dies—if the Fortitude save is a success, though, he rises the next evening as a _[[monsters/Vampire|vampire]]_. If a player character succumbs to this _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ curse and becomes a _vampire_, you should assume control of that PC until the other characters can defeat him and, hopefully, resurrect him. The compulsion to maintain ownership of _the Totemrix_ is a curse that functions at CL 15th.

A _vampire_ created in this manner continues to covet _the Totemrix_, and indeed, if separated from its ownership (or unable to benefit from its power, as in the case of it being joined to _[[items/Wondrous Item/The Morrowfall|the Morrowfall]]_), suffers a –4 penalty on all skill checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until he recovers the artifact.

In the hands of a _vampire_, _the Totemrix_ gains a _potent_ new ability—when the _vampire_ uses his children of the night ability, he may call upon _shadow_ beasts. When he calls upon _shadow_ beasts, he calls 2d6 shadowgarms (see Pathfinder Adventure Path volume #25), 1d4 _shadow_ rat swarms (see page 37), 1d4+1 shadows, or 1d3 _shadow_ mastiffs (see page 31). Although the _vampire_ can only do so as often as he can use children of the night (once a day for most vampires), _shadow_ beasts _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ in this manner persist in the area and follow the _vampire_'s last _[[spells/Command|command]]_ until they are slain or banished. At any one time, a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vampiric|vampiric]]_ wielder of _the Totemrix_ can maintain a number of _shadow_ beasts equal to the amount of spawn he can control (up to 52 at a time for Ilnerik); attempts to call more _shadow_ beasts while this total number is maxed still function, but the _called_ _shadow_ beasts persist for only up to 1 hour before vanishing.

### _[[spells/Destruction|Destruction]]_

When _the Totemrix_ is joined with its counterpart, _the Morrowfall_, its powers (as well as those of _the Morrowfall_) are suppressed. In this state, both it and _the Morrowfall_ can be destroyed by anything capable of destroying a magic metal object of its size.
