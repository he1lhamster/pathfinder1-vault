Title: "Chalice of Ozem"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "–"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "20"
Aura: "strong abjuration, strong evocation"
Description: |
  "This chalice is perhaps the last surviving artifact from Sacred Ozem, now forever lost in a tragic battle that ultimately led to the foundation of the Knights of Ozem. Made of shimmering mithral and studded with dozens of rubies, the _Chalice of Ozem_ was carried from the ruins and handed down through generations until it was finally given to Iomedae, who used it in her fight against Erum-Hel during the Battle of Three Sorrows.
  The chalice cannot be harmed by any substance it holds, no matter how caustic. Further, any liquid placed within the chalice will never spill unless the chalice's carrier wills it. If the chalice is held and the command phrase spoken ("Ozem for Iomedae!"), it projects a _globe of invulnerability_. If a second command phrase is spoken ("Her sheltering shield!") and a scooping motion is made with the chalice, a _resilient sphere_ is created around the carrier. Each of these effects can be called upon twice per day.
  Once per day, a mythic character can expend one use of mythic power while pouring a dose of holy water into the chalice to immediately transform that dose of holy water into a single dose of nectar of the gods (_Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures_ 155)."
Destruction: |
  "If the _Chalice of Ozem_ is filled with Iomedae's blood and Arazni drinks from it, the chalice shatters into glass fragments."
