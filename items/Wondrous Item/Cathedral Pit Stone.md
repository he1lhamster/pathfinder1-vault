Title: "Cathedral Pit Stone"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "600 gp"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "faint conjuration"
Description: |
  "A golden ribbon winds around this smooth, ring-shaped piece of basalt, which was created to emulate the pit of the Starstone. The stone can be thrown as a ranged attack with a range increment of 20 feet. When the stone strikes a target, it creates a 10-foot-wide, 20-foot-deep moat, as per _create pit_, leaving the target on a stone pillar equal in size to its space. Alternatively, the user can target a specific grid intersection (or merely drop the stone, which requires no attack roll) to create a 10-foot-wide, 20-foot-deep moat around the 5-foot square onto which it was thrown or dropped. (If the wielder throws the stone at a target and misses, treat the stone as a splash weapon to determine where it lands.) Each creature that is not the target in the area where a pit is created in this way must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex saving throw to jump to safety in the nearest open space. The pit disappears after 6 rounds. The stone is consumed upon being thrown or dropped."
