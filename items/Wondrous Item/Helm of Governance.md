Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "–"
Weight: "3 lbs."
Slot: "Head"
Caster level: "20"
Aura: "strong abjuration"
Description: |
  "This helm masks the wearer's face and functions as a _helm of telepathy_ combined with an _amulet of proof against detection and location_. The wearer can cast _disguise self_ at will and benefits from _discern lies_ and _true seeing_ at all times. The helm provides complete protection from all gaze attacks and all forms of mental control. The helm also interfaces with illusory effects, allowing the wearer to see and hear through certain illusions as though those illusions acted as scrying sensors. The helm is currently attuned to numerous projection pads depicting Jazradan's programmed image, scattered throughout the ruins of Azlant.
  Once per day as a swift action, the wearer of the _helm of governance_ can utter the Azlanti word for "stop," which causes a _time stop_ effect. Similarly, up to three times per day as a swift action, the wearer can say "insufficient" in Azlanti, which targets a creature within 300 feet with _greater dispel magic_."
Destruction: |
  "The helm is forever tied to its wearer, even unto death. Only by killing the helm's owner, Grand Arcanist Jazradan, can this artifact be destroyed."
