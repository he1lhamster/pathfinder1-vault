Title: "Kineticist's Diadem (Lesser)"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "18000 gp"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Headband"
Caster level: "10"
Aura: "moderate evocation"
Description: |
  "This metal headband holds a glistening, diamond-shaped gem. A _kineticist's diadem_ includes one of five colors of gem, each corresponding to a different element: blue (water), clear (aether), green (earth), red (fire), and white (air). The diadem's gem grants the wearer greater control over its associated element.
  While worn by a kineticist, this item increases the damage dealt by the kineticist's simple and composite blasts that match the element of the inlaid gem by 1d6 points (for a _lesser kineticist's diadem_), 2d6 points (for a _kineticist's diadem_), or 3d6 points (for a _greater kineticist's diadem_). If the blast is a physical blast, the extra damage dice from the _kineticist's diadem_ increase to d8s instead of d6s. These extra damage dice do not multiply on a critical hit, and the extra damage dice do not apply to blasts with form infusions that do not apply the extra damage from elemental overflow, like kinetic blade and kinetic whip."

### Description

This metal headband holds a glistening, diamond-shaped gem. A _[[classes/Kineticist|kineticist]]_'s diadem includes one of five colors of gem, each corresponding to a different element: blue (water), clear (aether), green (earth), red (fire), and white (air). The diadem's gem grants the wearer greater control over its associated element.

While worn by a _kineticist_, this item increases the damage dealt by the _kineticist_'s simple and composite blasts that match the element of the inlaid gem by 1d6 points (for a lesser _kineticist_'s diadem), 2d6 points (for a _kineticist_'s diadem), or 3d6 points (for a greater _kineticist_'s diadem). If the blast is a physical blast, the extra damage dice from the _kineticist_'s diadem increase to d8s instead of d6s. These extra damage dice do not multiply on a critical hit, and the extra damage dice do not apply to blasts with form infusions that do not apply the extra damage from elemental overflow, like kinetic blade and kinetic _[[items/Weapon/Whip|whip]]_.
