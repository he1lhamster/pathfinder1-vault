  "This minute crystal vial contains a single drop distilled from the captured dreams of a hundred different worlds. The drop can be poured into a vessel of water, wine, or other drink, and shared between as many as nine recipients. If not drunk within an hour of mixing, it loses potency.

  If an imbiber expends two uses of mythic power and envisions a destination as she falls asleep, she gains the benefits above and sleeps for 2 hours before waking on a plane of her choice as though using _plane shift_. Each imbiber who expends the uses of mythic power can travel to a different plane. All imbibers traveling to the same plane wake up at the same location on that plane."
