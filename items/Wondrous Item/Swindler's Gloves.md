Price: "9000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Hands"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate illusion"
Description: |
  "When the wearer of these jet-black leather gloves reaches for an item carried by another creature, inky strands of gloom swirl around the gloves, making the wearer's hand movements difficult to follow. The wearer does not provoke an attack of opportunity when attempting a disarm or steal combat maneuver check while wearing a pair of _swindler's gloves_. She also ignores the penalty on her combat maneuver check for attempting to disarm a foe while she is unarmed.
  Once per day as a swift action, upon using the _swindler's gloves_ to steal from or disarm a foe, the wearer can activate an illusion that causes the enemy to believe the maneuver failed. The item taken via the maneuver becomes invisible and an illusory duplicate of the item appears in the target's possession for 1 minute. This illusory item looks and feels like the original, but the target can attempt a DC 14 Will saving throw to realize the item he now holds is an illusory duplicate. In any event, when the user drops the item or attempts to use it, the shadow item fades away into shadows and is gone. The illusory duplicate is a shadow effect."
