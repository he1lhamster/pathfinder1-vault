Description: |
  "This small brass device is shaped like a compass or clock, and is designed for travel on planes without magnetic poles or set geography. When activated via a mechanical trigger, its geared arms rotate around to point toward the stronghold of either the plane's ruler or the three closest approximations, as per _planar orientation_, with the name or holy symbol of the entity in question appearing on the arm. In addition, pressing a lever on the back side can cause the device to switch over to a portal-finding function that acts as per _locate portal_, with a range of 3 miles.
  _Planar guides_ are notoriously tricky to make, and most have a 5% chance each time they're consulted of having their magic twisted to lead the user astray, usually pointing toward a hazard (such as the lair of a dangerous creature). This chance is cumulative each time the guide is consulted, but resets to 5% as soon as the user encounters such a hazard. _Planar guides_ without this flaw are rare and can easily cost twice as much as the standard model. At the same time, those with a higher percentage can be significantly cheaper, and are sometimes even given away freely to Material Plane travelers by locals—these last generally direct the user to a specific hazard known by the giver."
