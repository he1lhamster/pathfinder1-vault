Description: |
  "The _neverspill goblet_ was designed for one very simple purpose: to never have to worry about wasting Cayden Cailean's gifts. A goblet holds up to 1 cup of liquid (or 1 dose of a magic potable, such as a potion), and no matter how it is held or shaken, it never spills a drop, except down the throat of a willing drinker. A _neverspill goblet_ does not dispense its contents for someone unwilling to drink from it. The magic of the goblet also keeps fluids from accidentally entering the goblet. This does not prevent poisoning (since the poisoner's addition is intentional), but means if a _neverspill goblet_ is placed underwater and removed, its original contents remain undiluted. It is therefore possible to drink a potion from a neverspill goblet while underwater. Most _neverspill goblets_ are made from light, portable materials such as wood or pewter, or come in larger sizes. Its magical nature does not prevent it from corrosion by acid. Liquids placed in a _neverspill goblet_ do not succumb to the ravages of temperature or time, a fact that more than one adventurer has taken advantage of on journeys."
