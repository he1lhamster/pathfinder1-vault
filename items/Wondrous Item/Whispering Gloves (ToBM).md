Description: |
  "These gloves constantly project a very short-range _silence_ spell, so that anything touched or held by the wearer's hands makes no sound. Thus picking a locked door wouldn't make a clicking noise audible to those on the other side, and holding a hand over a victim's mouth would silence his scream. The silence extends only a few inches, so knocking on a door produces no sound but hammering it down still does.
  If the wearer presses a finger to her lips and speaks, no sound comes out, but the words are audible to anyone she chooses in her line of sight (as the _message_ spell)."
