Title: "Shadowwraith Heart"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "–"
Weight: "3 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "20"
Aura: "strong necromancy"
Description: |
  "This strangely shaped, ebon-colored rock streaked with deep purple veins is actually the petrified heart of a long-forgotten mythic hero. Over the centuries, the heart has appeared as an amulet, the head of a staff, and a mace head. Regardless of its form, the _Shadowwraith Heart_ functions the same. The heart seeks out the location of the nearest source of mythic power— either a creature or place—and when brought to the source devours its power. As soon as it comes within a 60-foot-radius of a mythic creature, it begins to leech off that creature's mythic power. Each round a mythic creature remains within the area of effect, it must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or lose 1d4 uses of mythic power. If the heart drains a mythic creature of all its daily uses of mythic power, the creature loses a mythic tier. The tier loss is semi-permanent, remaining until the creature successfully completes one trial."
Destruction: |
  "Implanting the _Shadowwraith Heart_ into the chest of a dying mythic hero reanimates the heart, restoring the hero as the _heal_ spell (CL 15th), though the hero loses all mythic tiers."
