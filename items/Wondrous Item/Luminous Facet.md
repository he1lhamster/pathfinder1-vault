  "This glass cone is welded to a brass base and contains a faint crimsonand- violet fire that burns in the shape of a blooming flower, but sheds no discernible light.
  By speaking the item's command word, a creature can ignite the flame within a _luminous facet_, which then sheds light as a torch.
