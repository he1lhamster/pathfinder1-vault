  "This beautiful, gem-encrusted golden chest measures 4 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 4 feet tall. The _chest of the mercane_ is engraved with symbols of wealth and trade, and comes with an equally ornate key. Even without its magic properties, the chest is worth 5,000 gp. The chest is bonded to a traveling mercane (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2_ 188) that makes i ts living trading magical items throughout the planes. The chest acts as if affected by the _secret chest_ spell (CL 9th), except it allows the key wielder to retrieve the chest once per day and send it back to its mercane master once per day. The chest's ornate key functions as the small replica chest does in _secret chest_.
  Each time the chest is sent back to its mercane master, there's a chance the mercane decides to buy any new magic item in the chest. If the mercane buys the item, it may pay slightly less than, equal to, or more than the standard market value (normally 50% of its total value). The mercane's interest and payment is determined by the table below. If the mercane does buy an item, the payment is always in gold pieces that take the item's place in the _chest of the mercane_.
  <table><tbody><tr><td>**d%**</td><td>**Mercane's Trade**</td></tr><tr><td>01–10</td><td>40% of the item's total value</td></tr><tr><td>11–50</td><td>Item is not purchased</td></tr><tr><td>51–90</td><td>50% of the item's total value</td></tr><tr><td>91–99</td><td>60% of the item's total value</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>75% of item's total value</td></tr></tbody></table>
  It's also possible to send notes to the mercane connected to the chest, but such notes never receive a response through the chest. If an owner of the _chest of the mercane_ finds the mercane connected to it, she can use the ability to pass notes to pay in advance (with magic items) for objects she wishes the mercane to purchase on the owner's behalf. Such objects are never sent via the chest; the mercane requires that they be picked up in person."
