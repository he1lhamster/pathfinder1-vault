Title: "Planar Keystone"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "16200 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "17"
Aura: "strong conjuration"
Description: |
  "A _planar keystone_ is a small cube etched with runes. Each _planar keystone_ is attuned to a specific site on a particular plane—this site must be determined when the _planar keystone_ is created and cannot be changed at a later date. Anyone examining the etched patterns can determine the plane and location with a successful DC 20 Knowledge (planes) check. Once per day, up to eight intelligent creatures within 20 feet of the _planar keystone_ can concentrate upon its etched patterns for 1 minute. This concentration is tenuous; if any of the creatures are attacked or pause to take other actions during this time, the concentration of all participants is broken and the _planar keystone's_ use for that day is lost. At the end of this time, all creatures concentrating on the _planar keystone_ are transported to the _planar keystone's_ site as if via _plane shift_, but arriving precisely on target. The _planar keystone_ travels with the creatures—it is not left behind in the process."

### Description

A _[[items/Wondrous Item/Planar Keystone|planar keystone]]_ is a small cube etched with runes. Each _planar keystone_ is attuned to a specific site on a particular plane—this site must be determined when the _planar keystone_ is created and cannot be changed at a later date. Anyone examining the etched patterns can determine the plane and location with a successful DC 20 Knowledge (planes) check. Once per day, up to eight intelligent creatures within 20 feet of the _planar keystone_ can concentrate upon its etched patterns for 1 minute. This concentration is tenuous; if any of the creatures are attacked or pause to take other actions during this time, the concentration of all participants is _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ and the _planar keystone_'s use for that day is lost. At the end of this time, all creatures concentrating on the _planar keystone_ are transported to the _planar keystone_'s site as if via _[[spells/Plane Shift|plane shift]]_, but arriving precisely on target. The _planar keystone_ travels with the creatures—it is not left behind in the process.
