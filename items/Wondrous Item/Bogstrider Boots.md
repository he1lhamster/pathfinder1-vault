  "These soft leather boots smell strongly of marsh gas, and leave faint wet prints behind even when they're dry. Despite these aesthetic flaws, _bogstrider boots_ are of great use in areas of swampy terrain. They provide the wearer the ability to move without penalty in squares of shallow or deep bog (_Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook_ 427), and the DCs of Acrobatics checks attempted by the boots' wearer are unchanged in squares of shallow bog. In addition, three times per day when the wearer takes a charge or withdraw action, she can increase her speed by 60 feet for 1 round."
