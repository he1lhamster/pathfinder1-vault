Description: |
  "A _runestone of power_ is a small chip of polished stone etched with a rune. These objects are potent aids to all spellcasters who cast spontaneously (but not to spellcasters like clerics who have the option to spontaneously cast certain spells). Once per day, a spontaneous caster can draw upon a _runestone of power_ to cast a spell—doing so is part of the spellcasting action, and expends that runestone's power for the day rather than one of the spellcaster's actual spell slots for the day. An expended _runestone of power_ recharges its capacity after 24 hours. The spell must be of a particular level, depending on the runestone."
