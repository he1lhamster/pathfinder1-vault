### Description

These gloves are made of pale _[[monsters/Gray|gray]]_ silk; each is adorned with an embroidered silver eye on the back. Once per day the wearer may activate them, as a standard action, by bowing her head and pressing her hands to her eyes. The embroidered silver eyes _[[spells/Flare|flare]]_ and open, and when the wearer lowers her hands, deep pools of swirling _gray_ mist hide her own eyes and allow her to more clearly see the restless dead for the next 10 rounds. While active, _[[items/Wondrous Item/Ghostvision Gloves|ghostvision gloves]]_ grant the following effects.

* The wearer can see all undead within 60 feet clearly, including ethereal undead and _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ undead hiding in objects or walls to a depth of 5 feet.
* If the wearer has the channel positive energy class ability, she may _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ one use of channeled positive energy to make a ranged touch attack against one undead creature within channel range. If the ranged touch attack hits, she rolls channel energy damage against that target (affecting no other creatures), except she rolls d12s instead of d6s.
* While the gloves are active, constructs and living opponents treat the wearer as blind.
