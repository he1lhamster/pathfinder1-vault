  "This long-stemmed, wooden pipe can burn any number of substances, but is primarily used for smoking tobacco. The pipe smoker can command a small, smoky servant to emerge from the pipe to do minor tasks. The servant can move or fetch small objects, and in general acts as an _unseen servant_, except that it is visible as a small, wispy cloud of gray smoke. Additionally, the servant is capable of clearing one 5-foot square of smoke or fog per round. The servant can be used for up to 1 hour per day; this time doesn't need to be continuous, but must be used in 10-minute increments.
  An investigator gains some additional benefits while smoking the pipe. He can use inspiration on Survival checks to track or Perception checks to notice fine details without spending a use of inspiration. Additionally, once per day he can attempt a Knowledge check as if he had the eidetic recollection investigator talent."
