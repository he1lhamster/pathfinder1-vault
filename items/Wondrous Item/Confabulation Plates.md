Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "9000 gp"
Weight: "5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "faint divination, faint necromancy"
Description: |
  "Approximately 10 inches on each side, these two square, brass-colored metal plates have rubber edges and screws at each corner used to tighten the plates like a clamp. In the center of the top plate is a fleshy tube that ends in a suction cup ringed with tiny teeth. Next to the base of the tube is a small winding key that powers the device and a toggle switch that selects the device's function (dead or plants).
  To use the _confabulation plates_ on a dead entity, the user must clamp the plates around part of the subject's body and attach the tube to the subject's bare skin. Then the user has to crank the winding key for 1 minute. Once this is complete, the user can ask the corpse two questions, and the response emits from the device in a metallic, buzzing tone. This effect is identical to _speak with dead_.
  If the device is selected to be able to communicate with plants and clamped onto a plant, the user can communicate freely with the subject for 5 minutes as the spell _speak with plants_.
  _Confabulation plates_ can be used once per day."
