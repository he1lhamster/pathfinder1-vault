Title: "Brass Spider"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "2500 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "This diminutive, shiny brass construct looks like a spider made of gears and cogs. It's roughly the size of an adult human's hand, and its legs are all picks, chisels, pliers, and other tools of fine manipulation. Its body contains reservoirs of powders and oils it can spray 2 inches out of its nozzle-spinnerets. A fine chain can be played out of a winch on the brass spider's back, connecting it to a small disk with studs and levers that control the construct's actions, enabling it to walk and crawl like a spider. It has no autonomous motivation.
  Once per day, a character holding the _brass spider's_ chain can use the Disable Device skill from 15 feet away without penalty, though he must have line of sight to the device he is attempting to disable. In most cases, this means any mishap caused by the skill affects the _brass spider_ (which has hardness 5 and 25 hit points) rather than the spider's controller. Additionally, the brass spider can be used without limit as masterwork thieves' tools, without the advantage of any additional range."
