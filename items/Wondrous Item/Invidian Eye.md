Title: "Invidian Eye"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "–"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Neck"
Caster level: "20"
Aura: "strong abjuration, strong divination"
Description: |
  "The _Invidian Eye_ rewards devotion and punishes betrayal. When first given to a creature, the necklace recognizes members of the creature's race and gender—but not a specific individual— as its owner. The owner automatically fails any saving throw made to resist the effects of divination magic, but the necklace seeks to protect the owner against danger, reactively casting spells to defend its wearer against effects that compromise her control. The spells the amulet can cast (and when it does so) include _freedom_ (in response to _imprisonment_, petrification, paralysis, and similar effects described by this spell), _greater dispel magic_ (in response to any fear or mind-affecting effect), _remove curse_ (in response to curses), _protection from chaos_ (in response to any form of possession or similar control). The wearer has no control over when these spells are cast and the target of these spells is always the wearer. The _Invidian Eye_ can cast each spell 3 times per day.
  If the _Invidian Eye_ is worn by a creature not of the race and gender it recognizes as its owner, it ceases to use its defensive properties. In addition, once every 1d6 days, the gem makes a self-destructive suggestion. The wearer must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or make a casual attempt to harm herself during the course of the day. This suggestion does not dominate the wearer's actions, but she might be compelled to cut herself if she's wielding a weapon or jump if she passes a high window. If the wearer resists this compulsion three times in a row, the _Invidian Eye_ takes more serious measures, conjuring a miniature _prismatic sphere_ into the wearer's throat, which causes the wearer to begin suffocating (_Core Rulebook_ 445). The sphere can only be removed by targeting the wearer with the same spells that normally remove a full size _prismatic wall_.
  The race and gender the _Invidian Eye_ perceives as its owner can be reset by casting _mage's disjunction_ upon the artifact, though this carries the normal risk of destroying the artifact. Whoever the necklace is next given to determines the artifact's new owner.
  The _Invidian Eye_ is under the effects of a permanent _nondetection_ spell. This affects only the artifact, not the wearer."
Destruction: |
  "The _Invidian Eye_ must be offered to 100 free-willed mortals who know nothing of its powers and be rejected by each."

### Description

The _[[items/Wondrous Item/Invidian Eye|Invidian Eye]]_ rewards devotion and punishes betrayal. When first given to a creature, the necklace recognizes members of the creature's race and gender—but not a specific individual— as its owner. The owner automatically fails any saving throw made to resist the effects of _divination_ magic, but the necklace seeks to protect the owner against danger, reactively casting spells to defend its wearer against effects that compromise her control. The spells the amulet can cast (and when it does so) include _[[spells/Freedom|freedom]]_ (in response to _[[spells/Imprisonment|imprisonment]]_, petrification, _[[universal monster rules/Paralysis|paralysis]]_, and similar effects described by this spell), greater _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ (in response to any _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ or mind-affecting effect), _[[spells/Remove Curse|remove curse]]_ (in response to curses), _[[spells/Protection From Chaos|protection from chaos]]_ (in response to any form of _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_ or similar control). The wearer has no control over when these spells are cast and the target of these spells is always the wearer. The _Invidian Eye_ can cast each spell 3 times per day.

If the _Invidian Eye_ is worn by a creature not of the race and gender it recognizes as its owner, it ceases to use its defensive properties. In addition, once every 1d6 days, the gem makes a self-destructive _[[spells/Suggestion|suggestion]]_. The wearer must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or make a casual attempt to _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ herself during the course of the day. This _suggestion_ does not dominate the wearer's actions, but she might be compelled to cut herself if she's wielding a weapon or _[[spells/Jump|jump]]_ if she passes a high window. If the wearer resists this compulsion three times in a row, the _Invidian Eye_ takes more serious measures, conjuring a miniature _[[spells/Prismatic Sphere|prismatic sphere]]_ into the wearer's throat, which causes the wearer to begin suffocating (Core Rulebook 445). The sphere can only be removed by targeting the wearer with the same spells that normally remove a full size _[[spells/Prismatic Wall|prismatic wall]]_.

The race and gender the _Invidian Eye_ perceives as its owner can be reset by casting _[[spells/Mage's Disjunction|mage's disjunction]]_ upon the artifact, though this carries the normal risk of destroying the artifact. Whoever the necklace is next given to determines the artifact's new owner.

The _Invidian Eye_ is under the effects of a permanent _[[spells/Nondetection|nondetection]]_ spell. This affects only the artifact, not the wearer.

### _[[spells/Destruction|Destruction]]_

The _Invidian Eye_ must be offered to 100 free-willed mortals who know nothing of its powers and be rejected by each.
