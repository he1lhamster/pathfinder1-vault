Title: "Helm of Brilliance (Lesser)"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "36000 gp"
Weight: "3 lbs."
Slot: "Head"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "moderate evocation"
Description: |
  "This helm functions like a _helm of brilliance_ but is lower-powered. Instead of the standard helm's allotment of gems, the lesser helm has 10 diamonds (_fireball_, 10d6 damage, Reflex DC 20 half), 20 corals (_flaming sphere_), 30 garnets (_scorching ray_), and 40 agates (_light_). It still glows near and harms undead, has the _flaming_ weapon special ability, and provides fire resistance (though only 20 instead of 30).
  Just like the standard helm, the wearer risks detonation if damaged by magical fire; diamonds become _fireballs_ centered on the wearer, corals become _flaming spheres_ in and adjacent to the wearer's space, garnets become _scorching rays_ that fire randomly at creatures in range, and the agates and the helm itself are destroyed."
Crafting cost: "18000 gp"
