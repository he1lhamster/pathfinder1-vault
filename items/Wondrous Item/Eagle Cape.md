Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Shoulders"
Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "Large eagle feathers decorate the back and arms of this magnificent cape. Should the cape's wearer fall more than 5 feet, the cape spreads out behind the wearer and she gently drifts to the ground. This acts exactly like a _feather fall_ spell for the wearer only. Once per day, if the wearer grasps the edges of the cape and spreads her arms, she transforms into an eagle (as per the _beast shape I_ spell, except that it allows only eagle form and the wearer gains the eagle's full fly speed of 80 feet). This effect lasts for 10 minutes but can be ended prematurely as a standard action. In addition, while in eagle form, the wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks."
