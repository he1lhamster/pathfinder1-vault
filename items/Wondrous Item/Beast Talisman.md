  "Carved to resemble a predatory animal, this small charm hangs from a leather cord.

When the wielder does so, she gains an enhancement bonus on all of her natural weapons equal to twice the level of the spell or spell slot expended. This enhancement bonus applies to attack and damage rolls made with the natural weapons and lasts for 5 minutes. The bonus does not allow the wielder's natural weapons to bypass damage reduction, except for DR/magic."
