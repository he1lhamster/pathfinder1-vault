  "These fur-lined boots grant the wearer the ability to glide easily across icy surfaces.

While fighting on ice, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD.
  Once per day, the wearer may cause all surfaces within a 30-foot radius of himself to become covered in a thin sheet of ice for 10 rounds. A creature can walk within or through this icy area at half normal speed with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move in that round, while failure by 5 or more means it falls. A creature using Acrobatics in this way is considered flat-footed and loses its Dexterity bonus to AC."
