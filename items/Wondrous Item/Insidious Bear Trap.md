Price: "6300 gp"
Weight: "10 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "faint transmutation"
Description: |
  "This bear trap looks no different from any other ordinary bear trap (_Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment_ 76), but it has several additional magical abilities. On command, an _insidious bear trap_ snaps shut, opens to release a trapped creature, or resets itself. The trap can also be set to ignore a creature that speaks a password (designated by the person setting the trap), thus preventing the trap from triggering when the creature enters the trap's location. In addition, the person setting the trap can effortlessly insert and withdraw the spike designed to secure the trap into the ground or even stone.
  Once per day, an _insidious bear trap_ can be commanded to turn invisible for up to 5 hours or until triggered. While invisible, the _insidious bear trap_ is virtually impossible to spot or disable (+40 to the DCs for Perception and Disable Device checks), though the person who set the trap can still see it. The trap receives no bonus on its melee attack roll. If a target of the trap has the trap sense class ability, it retains those bonuses to avoid the trap's attack. Additionally, once per day, an _insidious bear trap_ can also be set to emit an audible alarm or mental ping, as per the _alarm_ spell, when it is triggered."
