Title: "Meridian Belt"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "1000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Belt"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "This narrow cloth belt has a silver buckle in the shape of four rings. The belt allows a creature to wear a magic ring on each foot in addition to the ring on each hand, though only two rings function at any given time. As a swift action, the wearer can change which of his rings are active (both hands, both feet, left hand and right foot, and so on). For example, a creature could wear a _ring of protection_, _ring of energy resistance_, _ring of swimming_, and _ring of counterspells_, switching between any two of them as a swift action each round as it desires.
  The belt does not change the type of action required to activate a ring (for example, activating a _ring of invisibility_ is still a standard action), but allows the wearer to easily switch between the constant powers of several worn rings. While the belt is worn, wearing a ring on a foot counts toward the attunement process of certain rings (such as a _ring of sustenance_) even if the belt isn't used to make that ring active during that attunement period."

### Description

This narrow cloth belt has a silver buckle in the shape of four rings. The belt allows a creature to wear a magic ring on each foot in addition to the ring on each hand, though only two rings function at any given time. As a swift action, the wearer can change which of his rings are active (both hands, both feet, left hand and right foot, and so on). For example, a creature could wear a ring of protection, ring of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Energy Resistance|energy resistance]]_, _[[items/Ring/Ring of Swimming|ring of swimming]]_, and _[[items/Ring/Ring of Counterspells|ring of counterspells]]_, switching between any two of them as a swift action each round as it desires.

The belt does not change the type of action required to activate a ring (for example, activating a _[[items/Ring/Ring of Invisibility|ring of invisibility]]_ is still a standard action), but allows the wearer to easily switch between the constant powers of several worn rings. While the belt is worn, wearing a ring on a foot counts toward the attunement process of certain rings (such as a _[[items/Ring/Ring of Sustenance|ring of sustenance]]_) even if the belt isn't used to make that ring active during that attunement period.
