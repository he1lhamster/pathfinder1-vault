Description: |
  "This giant-sized silver brooch is fashioned in the shape of a roc's head inscribed inside a circle. A _roc rider badge_ automatically neutralizes the energy field around Ironcloud Keep (see page 20) in a 200-foot-radius sphere around the wearer, allowing the wearer and his mount (if any) to freely move through the field. In addition, the wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on Handle Animal and Ride checks dealing with aerial mounts. A _roc rider badge_ also allows its wearer to improve the initial attitude of birds of all kinds, as if the wearer had the wild empathy ranger class feature. If the wearer already has the wild empathy class feature, the _roc rider badge_ grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on wild empathy checks against birds. A _roc rider badge_ occupies the neck slot on Large or Huge creatures, but a Medium creature can wear the badge as a pectoral in the chest slot."
