Description: |
  "This shallow box contains an assortment of beeswax, oils, pigments, brushes, and quills, and allows a user to blend seemlessly into new cultures and fashion scenes. By spending 5 minutes applying these contents, a user may adopt the hairstyle, fashion, and social cues of any culture with which he is familiar, granting a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff or Diplomacy checks with members of that culture, but leaving him otherwise recognizable. Alternatively, the palette may be used to conceal the user's identity entirely; it cannot make the user appear shorter or taller or otherwise alter their body, but otherwise allows him to adopt the appearance of another creature of the same type with the same body type and build. Either application lasts for 5 hours or until removed with soap and water. A _resplendent diplomat's palette_ has 50 charges when created, and each use consumes 1 charge.
  The palette qualifies as a disguise kit, granting a +2 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. Using it as such does not consume a charge."
