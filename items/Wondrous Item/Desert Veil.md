  "Small round mirrors adorn the edges of this yellow, Qadiran silk veil, which covers the wearer's mouth and nose. The veil protects the wearer against extreme temperatures, as per _endure elements_. In addition, once per day while in a warm or temperate desert, the wearer can speak a command word to create a 20-foot-radius oasis that functions like a casting of _grove of respite_. The oasis appears in a spot the wearer designates within 40 feet and disappears after 8 hours. Any creature outside the oasis that sees it must succeed at a DC 16 Will saving throw or dismiss it as a mirage to be ignored. A creature that steps inside the oasis, however, recognizes its substance."
