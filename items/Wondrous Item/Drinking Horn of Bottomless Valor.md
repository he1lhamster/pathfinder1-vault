Description: |
  "This horn is bound with fittings of gold and decorated with ornate carvings depicting scenes of glorious battle. A fully charged horn has 3 charges—charges used are automatically renewed each day. So long as the horn has at least one charge remaining, it's owner can command it to fill with mead or a similar alcoholic drink. A creature can spend one or more charges while drinking from the horn to gain the following benefits:
  _1 charge_: The drinker gains 1d8 temporary hit points (as if from an _aid_ spell), which last for 1 minute.
  _2 charges_: The drinker gains 1d8+5 temporary hit points and is enlarged, as the spell _enlarge person_, for 5 minutes.
  _3 charges_: The drinker gains 1d8+10 temporary hit points, is enlarged for 10 minutes, and gains the benefit of a _heroism_ spell for as long as she is enlarged.
  A creature must drink deeply from the horn to receive its full benefit. Using 1 charge is similar to drinking a potion—it takes a standard action and provokes an attack of opportunity (though certain abilities can reduce the action required). To use 2 charges, the drinker must spend a full round drinking from the horn, which always provokes and attack of opportunity. To use all 3 charges, the drinker must spend 2 full-round actions drinking from the horn."
