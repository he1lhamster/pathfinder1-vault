Price: "500 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "10"
Aura: "moderate necromancy"
Description: |
  "This leather bottle is filled to the brim with frothy green liquid. As a full-round action, a witch can target the bottle with any hex (but not a greater or grand hex) she knows that targets a single creature, transferring its effects to the brew within, which congeals into a sticky syrup. Any creature can use this syrup as a dose of injury poison (including the 5% chance to affect the user if she does not possess the poison use class feature). Any creature struck by a weapon coated in this syrup must save against the hex (DC 15) or be affected as if the witch had targeted them with the hex directly. The syrup counts as a poison and is a magical effect. If the hex cannot affect a target more than once every 24 hours, subsequent doses of the syrup are similarly ineffective against that target. Once imbued with the power of a hex, the syrup lasts for 24 hours before reverting into useless, harmless liquid."
