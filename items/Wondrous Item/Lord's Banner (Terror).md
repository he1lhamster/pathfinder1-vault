Description: |
  "A _lord's banner_ is a cloth flag or standard, typically at least 2 feet wide and 4 feet long (though some are up to twice that size), meant to be carried and displayed on a lance, polearm, frame, or staff. It has no effect when not mounted properly or when laying on the ground. It normally depicts the insignia or heraldic symbol of a particular noble.
  A _lord's banner_ may be carried (on foot or mounted) or planted. In the latter case, the banner does not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of its owner.
  _Crusades_ (evocation aura): A noble-looking _lord's banner of crusades_ emits a hallow effect in a 40-foot radius around it, so long as it is borne by one true to the religion of the person whose crest is on the banner (these sorts of banners usually have a holy symbol or other religious insignia worked into the design).
  _Swiftness_ (abjuration aura): A group or army that are traveling under a _lord's banner of swiftness_ can make a forced march without needing Constitution checks or suffering any nonlethal damage from doing so, allowing them to cover great distances while still arriving ready to do battle. This ability affects all allied creatures within 1 mile as long as they are able to see the banner at least once a day.
  _Terror_ (necromancy aura): Enemies of the bearer of a _lord's banner of terror_, while within 30 feet and able to see the banner, must make a DC 16 Will save or become panicked, fleeing as quickly as possible for as long as they can see the banner. Those that succeed on the save are shaken. A creature that makes its saving throw cannot be panicked by the banner for 24 hours.
  _Victory_ (evocation aura): Allies of the owner of a _lord's banner of victory_ gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks for as long as they can see the banner."
