Title: "Mummified Guardian"

Price: "3500 gp"
Weight: "3 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "3"
Aura: "faint necromancy"
Description: |
  "This mummified house cat—dried, filled with sand, and bound in linen wrappings— appears to be nothing more than a family pet buried alongside its deceased master. Far more than a mere pet, however, a _mummified guardian_ protects and preserves the corpse it is interred with and acts as a guardian against grave robbers and looters, potentially driving such trespassers toward more dangerous defenders or traps. When placed inside a sarcophagus or coffin alongside a dead body and activated, a _mummified guardian_ also infuses the corpse with positive energy, preventing the body from being turned into an undead creature, as _sanctify corpse_.
  In addition, the _mummified guardian_ also creates a magical ward around the sarcophagus containing it. If the sarcophagus is opened after the _mummified guardian_ is placed inside, any creature with 5 Hit Dice or fewer within 20 feet of the open sarcophagus is overcome by a feeling of dread and must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be frightened for 3 rounds. On a successful save, a creature is instead shaken for 1 round. This ability functions only once. Once triggered, the _mummified guardian_ retains only its _sanctify corpse_ ability (this reduces the price of the _mummified guardian_ to 3,000 gp).
  If the sarcophagus containing the _mummified guardian_ is placed in an area or room with multiple paths of egress, the owner may designate one general direction an affected target must take if it flees, as long as the chosen direction does not require the target to move any closer to the _mummified guardian_. After moving in the designated direction for 1 round, the target behaves as normal for the frightened condition for the remainder of the effect's duration.
  A _mummified guardian_ must be placed inside a sarcophagus, coffin, or other enclosed container with a dead body to function. Although cats are most common, _mummified guardians_ can be created from the mummified remains of other small animals as well."

### Description

This mummified house cat—dried, filled with sand, and bound in linen wrappings— appears to be nothing more than a family pet buried alongside its deceased master. Far more than a mere pet, however, a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Mummified Guardian|mummified guardian]]_ protects and preserves the corpse it is interred with and acts as a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Guardian|guardian]]_ against grave robbers and looters, potentially driving such trespassers toward more dangerous defenders or traps. When placed inside a sarcophagus or coffin alongside a dead body and activated, a _mummified guardian_ also infuses the corpse with positive energy, preventing the body from being turned into an undead creature, as _[[spells/Sanctify Corpse|sanctify corpse]]_.

In addition, the _mummified guardian_ also creates a magical ward around the sarcophagus containing it. If the sarcophagus is opened after the _mummified guardian_ is placed inside, any creature with 5 Hit Dice or fewer within 20 feet of the open sarcophagus is overcome by a feeling of dread and must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_ for 3 rounds. On a successful save, a creature is instead _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 1 round. This ability functions only once. Once triggered, the _mummified guardian_ retains only its _sanctify corpse_ ability (this reduces the price of the _mummified guardian_ to 3,000 gp).

If the sarcophagus containing the _mummified guardian_ is placed in an area or room with multiple paths of egress, the owner may designate one general direction an affected target must take if it flees, as long as the chosen direction does not require the target to move any closer to the _mummified guardian_. After moving in the designated direction for 1 round, the target behaves as normal for the _frightened_ condition for the remainder of the effect's duration.

A _mummified guardian_ must be placed inside a sarcophagus, coffin, or other enclosed container with a dead body to function. Although cats are most common, mummified guardians can be created from the mummified remains of other small animals as well.
