Aura: "moderate divination"
Description: |
  "_Crystal balls of the dark void_ look like dark-colored _crystal balls_. Upon inspection, most appear to be filled with roiling clouds of midnight blue smoke, but some seem to contain motes of light that evoke the night sky. This item functions as a standard crystal ball, but can be used to cast sending once per day targeting any creature observed in the crystal ball.
  Once per month, the user can attempt to use a _crystal ball of the dark void_ to contact a flying creature from the depths of space called a shantak (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2_ 244). The user must attempt at a DC 25 Spellcraft check. If the attempt to contact a shantak is successful, the monster flies to the location where the user was when contact was made. It arrives there in 3d20 hours, at which point the user must use Diplomacy or magic to compel the shantak to serve him. Failure to do so (or failure to meet the shantak) causes the angry shantak to remain in the area for 2d6 hours, attacking anything that comes near.
  Every time a _crystal ball of the dark void_ is used, there's a 5% chance that the item doesn't work as intended and instead reveals glimpses of alien horrors from the depths of the Dark Tapestry to the user, who must immediately attempt a DC 20 Will save to avoid taking 1d4 points of Wisdom drain."
