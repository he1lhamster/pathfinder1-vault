Caster level: "1"
Aura: "faint transmutation"
Description: |
  "A _courier's secure pouch_ appears as a typical soft-sided leather satchel with a shoulder strap and a fold-over flap with a buckle that can be fastened to seal documents inside. The pouch allows for the safe transport of important, sensitive, or secret documents from one place to another with minimal risk of them falling into the wrong hands. When any type of letters, writs, contracts, or even scrolls are placed inside the pouch, the buckle is fastened, and the command word is uttered, the pouch seals the documents safely inside, magically protecting them from being removed again. Unless the answering command word is uttered before unbuckling the flap, the magic of the pouch instantly and completely erases all the text, leaving behind only blank pages, as per the _erase_ spell. Attempting to cut or otherwise damage the pouch in order to bypass the buckle results in the magical protection taking effect, but the pouch itself withstands damage as normal for a magic item. Attempting to deactivate the pouch's magic without attempting to open it doesn't trigger the erasure. The _courier's secure pouch_ can protect five pages of writing. If more pages (or an entire book) are placed inside, only the first five pages are affected. Only paper, parchment, vellum, and similar materials are affected; writing inscribed on wood, stone, or wax are not subject to the pouch's magic."
