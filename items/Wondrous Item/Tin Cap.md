  "This simple tin headpiece is a lesser replica of the powerful _stannum crown_. A _tin cap_ feeds on its wearer's paranoia, granting her a +4 insight bonus on saving throws against mindaffecting effects and divinations that gather information about her. Donning a _tin cap_ saps the mind of the wearer, imposing a –2 penalty to her Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. The increased paranoia causes the wearer to always attempt saving throws, even against harmless effects. Removing the _tin cap_ removes both the benefits and drawbacks until it is donned again."
