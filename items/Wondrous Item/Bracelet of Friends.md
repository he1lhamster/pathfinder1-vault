Description: |
  "This silver charm bracelet has four charms upon it when created. The owner may designate one person known to him to be keyed to each charm. (This designation takes a standard action, but once done it lasts forever or until changed.) When a charm is grasped and the name of the keyed individual is spoken, that person is called to the spot (a standard action) appearing at the user's location along with his gear, as long as the bracelets's owner and the called person are on the same plane. The keyed individual knows who is attempting to teleport him, and the _bracelet of friends_ only functions on willing travelers. Once a charm is activated, it disappears. Charms separated from the bracelet are worthless. A bracelet found with fewer than four charms is worth 25% less for each missing charm."
