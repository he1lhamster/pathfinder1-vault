Description: |
  "This crystal appears to be a long, rough prism. Upon utterance of a command word, though, the gem's facets suddenly grow highly polished as the crystal emits bright light of one of three sorts.
  One command word causes the gem to shed light as a hooded lantern. This use of the gem does not expend any charges, and it continues to emit light until this command word is spoken a second time to extinguish the illumination.
  Another command word causes the _gem of brightness_ to send out a bright ray 1 foot in diameter and 50 feet long. This strikes as a ranged touch attack, and any creature struck by this beam is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a DC 14 Fortitude save. This use of the gem expends 1 charge.
  The third command word causes the gem to flare in a blinding flash of light that fills a 30-foot cone. Although this glare lasts but a moment, any creature within the cone must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. This use expends 5 charges.
  A newly created _gem of brightness_ has 50 charges. When all its charges are expended, the gem becomes nonmagical and its facets grow cloudy with a fine network of cracks."

One _command_ word causes the gem to shed light as a _[[items/Mundane/Hooded lantern|hooded lantern]]_. This use of the gem does not _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ any charges, and it continues to emit light until this _command_ word is spoken a second time to extinguish the illumination.

Another _command_ word causes the _[[items/Wondrous Item/Gem of Brightness|gem of brightness]]_ to send out a bright ray 1 foot in diameter and 50 feet long. This strikes as a ranged touch attack, and any creature struck by this beam is _[[conditions/Blinded|blinded]]_ for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a DC 14 Fortitude save. This use of the gem expends 1 charge.

The third _command_ word causes the gem to _[[spells/Flare|flare]]_ in a _[[feats/Blinding Flash|blinding flash]]_ of light that fills a 30-foot cone.

A newly created _gem of brightness_ has 50 charges. When all its charges are expended, the gem becomes nonmagical and its facets grow cloudy with a fine network of cracks.
