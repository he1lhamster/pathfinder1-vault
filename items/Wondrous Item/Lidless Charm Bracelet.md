Title: "Lidless Charm Bracelet"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "10000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Wrists"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate abjuration"
Description: |
  "This bronze, serpentine bracelet has five dangling charms, each depicting an open and staring eye. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can touch the bracelet to a creature with a gaze attack (requiring a successful touch attack for unwilling creatures) and become immune to natural gaze attacks from all creatures of that kind for the following 24 hours. The wearer could, for example, touch the bracelet to a basilisk to gain immunity to the gaze attacks of all basilisks, but would not be immune to the gaze of a medusa. This ability does not grant immunity to gaze attacks from spells or magic items such as _eyes of doom_. For the duration of this immunity, the charms on the bracelet each appear to be closed eyes.
  When the wearer fails a save against a gaze attack, she can expend a charm from the bracelet as an immediate action to reroll that saving throw, but must take the second result even if it is worse. An expended charm crumbles to dust. When the last charm is expended, the _lidless charm bracelet_ loses all magical properties."
Crafting cost: "5000 gp"

### Description

This bronze, serpentine bracelet has five dangling charms, each depicting an open and staring eye. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can touch the bracelet to a creature with a _[[universal monster rules/Gaze|gaze]]_ attack (requiring a successful touch attack for unwilling creatures) and become immune to natural _gaze_ attacks from all creatures of that kind for the following 24 hours. The wearer could, for example, touch the bracelet to a _[[monsters/Basilisk|basilisk]]_ to gain _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to the _gaze_ attacks of all basilisks, but would not be immune to the _gaze_ of a _[[monsters/Medusa|medusa]]_. This ability does not grant _immunity_ to _gaze_ attacks from spells or magic items such as _[[items/Wondrous Item/Eyes of Doom|eyes of doom]]_. For the duration of this _immunity_, the charms on the bracelet each appear to be closed eyes.

When the wearer fails a save against a _gaze_ attack, she can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ a charm from the bracelet as an immediate action to reroll that saving throw, but must take the second result even if it is worse. An expended charm crumbles to dust. When the last charm is expended, the _[[items/Wondrous Item/Lidless Charm Bracelet|lidless charm bracelet]]_ loses all magical properties.
