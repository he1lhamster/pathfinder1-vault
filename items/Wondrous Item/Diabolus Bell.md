Description: |
  "This black, iron bell is inscribed with diabolical symbols. The spherical clapper is affixed to a chain, resembling a tyrant's ball and chain. _Diabolus bells_ can be dedicated to other powers of Hell, such as archdevils. They act as divine foci for spells granted by associated patrons.
  Once per day, when the wielder speaks a command word while ringing the bell (a standard action), lawful neutral or lawful evil creatures within a 20-foot radius that hear the toll and worship Asmodeus can say a prayer to Asmodeus as a move action to be affected as per _ward the faithful_. The supplication must be said before the beginning of the wielder's next turn and within 20 feet of the bell.
  Chaotic or good creatures within a 20-foot radius that hear the toll must instead succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be affected as per _doom_. Creatures that are both chaotic and good that fail the Will save take 1d8 points of sonic damage and must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round.
  Finally, any living creatures within a 20-foot radius that have –1 or fewer hit points must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be slain as per _death knell_. At the beginning of the wielder's next turn, if the bell's _death knell_ effect slew a creature, the wielder can then choose to grant the benefits of _death knell_ to either himself or any one creature within sight that is benefiting from the bell's _ward the faithful_ effect. Even if multiple enemy creatures fail their saving throws versus the _death knell_ effect, only one creature gains the benefits."

### Description

This black, iron _[[items/Mundane/Bell|bell]]_ is inscribed with diabolical symbols. The spherical clapper is affixed to a chain, resembling a tyrant's ball and chain. Diabolus bells can be dedicated to other powers of Hell, such as archdevils. They act as divine foci for spells granted by associated patrons.

Once per day, when the wielder speaks a _[[spells/Command|command]]_ word while ringing the _bell_ (a standard action), lawful neutral or lawful evil creatures within a 20-foot radius that hear the toll and worship Asmodeus can say a _[[spells/Prayer|prayer]]_ to Asmodeus as a move action to be affected as per _[[spells/Ward the Faithful|ward the faithful]]_. The supplication must be said before the beginning of the wielder's next turn and within 20 feet of the _bell_.

Chaotic or good creatures within a 20-foot radius that hear the toll must instead succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be affected as per _[[spells/Doom|doom]]_. Creatures that are both chaotic and good that fail the Will save take 1d8 points of sonic damage and must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or be _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_ for 1 round.

Finally, any living creatures within a 20-foot radius that have –1 or fewer hit points must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be slain as per _[[spells/Death Knell|death knell]]_. At the beginning of the wielder's next turn, if the _bell_'s _death knell_ effect slew a creature, the wielder can then choose to grant the benefits of _death knell_ to either himself or any one creature within sight that is benefiting from the _bell_'s _ward the faithful_ effect. Even if multiple enemy creatures fail their saving throws versus the _death knell_ effect, only one creature gains the benefits.
