Description: |
  "When this _ioun stone_ is embedded in a clockwork construct, it grants the recipient humanlike sentience, as per the _awaken construct_ spell. The transformation is not permanent, and regardless of the body a stone is embedded in, the creature in which it's embedded always gains the same alignment, Charisma score increase, Intelligence score, language, memories, personality, and skills. These statistics depend on the _ioun memory node type_, as noted in the table below.
  <table><tbody><tr><td>**Type**</td><td>**Int**</td><td>**Cha**</td><td>**Skills**</td><td>**Languages**</td><td>**Max HD**</td></tr><tr><td>I</td><td>7</td><td>+2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>II</td><td>10</td><td>+5</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>III</td><td>12</td><td>+7</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>IV</td><td>15</td><td>+10</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>16</td></tr></tbody></table>
  The skills, languages, and alignment are chosen when the node is created. The node grants a number of skill ranks in those skills equal to the clockwork's Hit Dice. Unlike _awaken construct_, an _ioun memory node_ doesn't grant feats. A clockwork that is already intelligent can access the memories collected in the _ioun memory node_ but is otherwise unaffected. A clockwork whose number of Hit Dice exceeds the maximum HD for that type of _ioun memory node_ is unaffected."
