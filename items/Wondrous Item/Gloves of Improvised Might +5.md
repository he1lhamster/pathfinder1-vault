Price: "100000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Hands"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "faint transmutation"
Description: |
  "These rough leather gloves grant an enhancement bonus of +1 to +5 on attack and damage rolls with improvised weapons. Alternatively, the gloves can grant melee weapon special abilities, so long as they can be applied to melee or thrown weapons (see pages 136– 137 of _Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment_ for a list of abilities). Special abilities count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of the item, but do not modify attack or damage bonuses. _Gloves of improvised might_ cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +5. Unlike an _amulet of mighty fists_, _gloves of improvised might_ must have a +1 enhancement bonus to grant a melee weapon special ability.
  Normal weapons are unaffected by _gloves of improvised might_ except when used as an improvised weapon in a way specifically permitted by the weapon description, such as using an arrow or bolt as a melee weapon (or if the user has an ability that allows the use of normal weapons as improvised weapons). The wearer still takes a –4 nonproficiency penalty on attack rolls with improvised weapons, as normal, unless he has the Catch Off-Guard feat or a similar ability."
