Description: |
  "Each of the several kinds of _figurines of wondrous power_ appears to be a miniature statuette of a creature an inch or so high (with one exception). When the figurine is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak.
  If a _figurine of wondrous power_ is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time.
  **Silver Raven**: This silver figurine turns into a raven on command (but it retains its metallic consistency, which gives it hardness 10). Another command sends it off into the air, bearing a message just like a creature affected by an _animal messenger_ spell. If not commanded to carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its owner, although it has no special powers or telepathic abilities. It can maintain its nonfigurine status for only 24 hours per week, but the duration need not be continuous.; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animal messenger_, _animate objects_.
  **Coral Hippocampus**: When animated, this _figurine of wondrous_ power (_Core Rulebook_ 513) acts in all ways like a normal combat-trained hippocampus (_Bestiary 2_ 155). The item can be used three times per week for up to 12 hours per use. When 12 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the coral hippocampus again becomes a tiny statuette.; CL 19th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects_.
  **Emerald Frog**: This _figurine of wondrous power_ appears as a small, innocuous frog carved of cloudy emerald. On command, it transforms into either a giant frog with the advanced template or 3 poisonous frogs—the user makes this choice at the time of activation. The frog (or frogs) can be animated up to 3 times per week, for a maximum total duration of 12 hours per week. If the advanced giant frog is slain, the _emerald frog_ cannot be activated again for 1 full week. Each poisonous frog that is slain in combat reduces the total duration that the figurine can be activated for the week by 4 hours.
  Either the giant frog or the poisonous frogs can be used as combatants or as small, unintelligent servant-creatures, performing minor tasks or fetching small objects. The giant frog can be used by Small or smaller creatures as a makeshift mount, although it is not equipped with a saddle or similar equipment, and its slick hide imposes an additional –4 penalty on Ride attempts.; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects_.
  **Lapis Camel**: This palm-sized camel figurine is sculpted of lapis lazuli. When you throw the _lapis camel_ to the ground and speak the command word, it turns into a dromedary camel. The camel acts as a normal camel in all respects, except that it obeys your verbal commands to the best of its animal-level intelligence. At your command, the camel returns to its figurine form. The _lapis camel_ can be used up to 3 times per week for up 8 hours each use.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate object_.
  **Pearl Dolphin**: This 2-inch-long pearl figurine turns into a dolphin on command (but it retains its composition, which gives it hardness 10). The dolphin follows the verbal commands of the creature who spoke the command word and will follow commands as a summoned creature. With a second command word, the dolphin will swim to an indicated location at double its swim speed, bearing a message just like a creature affected by an _animal messenger_ spell.
  The _pearl dolphin_ can maintain its nonfigurine status for only 24 hours per week. The duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-hour increments.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animal messenger_, _animate objects_.
  **Ruby Butterfly**: Upon command, this _figurine of wondrous power_ transforms into a hand-sized red butterfly (same statistics as a bat). A spellcaster can use a ruby butterfly to deliver touch spells, as if the _ruby butterfly_ were a familiar capable of this ability. A ruby butterfly can also be commanded to guard its owner while he sleeps. Creatures protected this way gain a +5 luck bonus on saving throws against any spell or effect that affects sleeping creatures' dreams (such as _nightmare_ or a night hag's dream haunting ability). A ruby butterfly can be used three times per week for up to 8 hours at a time.; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate object_, _dream_.
  **Black Jade Raven**: This fist-sized piece of black jade is exquisitely tooled into the shape of a raven with outstretched wings. Upon command, it transforms into a black raven (use the stats for an eagle) or a giant black raven (use the stats for a giant eagle). Both forms of the raven have Improved Steal as a bonus feat. The raven understands Common but cannot speak. It can answer questions related to its abilities or what it has seen by cawing once for "yes" and twice for "no."
  The raven can maintain its non-figurine status for only 24 hours per week. This duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-hour increments. After three transformations into its giant raven form (though not its smaller version), the statuette loses all magical properties.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects_.
  **Serpentine Eagle**: This Andoren variant of the _serpentine owl_ can be transformed into an eagle or giant eagle but is otherwise identical to the owl figurine. _Serpentine eagles_ are popular among Eagle Knights for scouting and emergency transportation.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects_.
  **Serpentine Owl**: This figurine becomes either a normal-sized horned owl or a giant owl (use the stats for the giant eagle) according to the command word used. The transformation can take place once per day, with a maximum duration of 8 continuous hours. However, after three transformations into giant owl form, the statuette loses all its magical properties. The owl communicates with its owner by telepathic means, informing her of all it sees and hears.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects_.
  **Bronze Griffon**: When animated, a bronze griffon acts in all ways like a normal griffon under the command of its possessor. The item can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use. When 6 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the bronze griffon once again becomes a tiny statuette.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects_.
  **Ebony Fly**: When animated, an ebony fly is the size of a pony and has all the statistics of a pegasus but can make no attacks. The item can be used three times per week for up to 12 hours per use. When 12 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the ebony fly again becomes a tiny statuette.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects_.
  **Hematite Courgar**: This palm-sized figurine of a cat with a spiked tail is made of gleaming hematite. A hematite cougar turns into a digmaul (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 5_ 82) that is fully obedient to the figurine's owner. Even in its animated form, the hematite cougar is made of dense metal, granting it a +2 armor bonus to AC and a +2 bonus to its CMD. An animated hematite cougar conducts low levels of electricity; creatures adjacent to the hematite cougar gain electricity resistance 2, but any damage prevented by this ability is dealt to the hematite cougar instead. A hematite cougar can be animated twice per week for up to 8 hours per use; speaking the command word before the 8 hours expires returns the hematite cougar to a figurine.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects_, _resist energy_.
  **Slate Spider**: This statuette of a spider with stubby legs can be used once per day for 1 minute. When activated, the figurine sprouts longer, segmented legs, and scampers about the bearer, picking lint off robes, chiseling grime from armor, or otherwise grooming the bearer. If commanded to do so (a free action), it perches on the muzzle of a one-handed or two-handed firearm barrel and, after the firearm is fired, travels down the barrel and cleans out the firearm. Each time the slate spider cleans a firearm, the next shot the firearm fires has no chance of misfiring.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects_.
  **Tin Imp**: These fat, smirking imp figurines are made of solid tin. A _tin imp_ turns into an imp (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary_ 78) on command, though it retains its metallic consistency, which gives it a +4 armor bonus to AC. In imp form, a _tin imp_ can turn invisible at will as a swift action, though it retains none of an imp's other spelllike abilities and lacks a poisoned sting. _Tin imps_ generally avoid combat, but make excellent spies and trackers.
  The _tin imp's_ owner can, as a move action, designate a single creature in his line of sight as the _tin imp's_ quarry. The _tin imp_ then follows its quarry clandestinely, and sends a whispered message to its owner once each hour detailing the quarry's location and activities. The message is similar to the _whispering wind_ spell, though the message unerringly locates the _tin imp's_ owner instead of moving to a predetermined location. A _tin imp_ can maintain its animate status for up to 48 hours per week. This duration doesn't need to be continuous, but must be used in 1-hour increments. If slain in combat, a _tin imp_ is destroyed.
  Additionally, a creature with the track class feature can command a _tin imp_ he owns to study a set of footprints (a standard action) and designate the creature that made the footprints as its quarry. The _tin imp_ can then attempt to track the creature as if its owner was tracking it, using the owner's Perception and Survival skill (and any tracking bonuses).; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects_, _invisibility_, _whispering wind_.
  **Glass Walrus**: This _figurine of wondrous power_ is shaped like a walrus and is carved out of a prismatic crystal. It follows all the normal rules for _figurines of wondrous power_ (_Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook_ 513). When animated, a glass walrus acts in all ways like a normal walrus (see page 29) except it can glide along the surface of water as though under the constant effects of _water walk_. Up to two Medium creatures or four Small creatures can fit on a glass walrus's back as the creature glides across water (the walrus moves at half speed while carrying creatures), and the walrus can carry up to 600 pounds in this way before it becomes too encumbered to move. A glass walrus can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use. When 6 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the glass walrus again becomes a tiny statuette.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects_, _water walk_.
  **Obsidian Raven**: This _figurine of wondrous power_ is similar to a _silver raven_, but it can be used to send messages across the planes. On command, the figurine turns into a raven (retaining its stone-like consistency, which gives it hardness 8). Another command sends it off into the air, bearing a message as the _sending_ spell (with no chance of the message not arriving). The recipient of the message can then use the _obsidian raven_ to _plane shift_ (self only) to the plane from which the message was sent. The figurine can be used in this way once per day. If not commanded to carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its owner, although it has no special abilities, and it can maintain its non-figurine status for 24 hours per week (the duration need not be continuous).; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects_, _plane shift_, _sending_.
  **Onyx Dog**: When commanded, this statuette changes into a creature with the same properties as a riding dog except that it is endowed with an Intelligence of 8, can communicate in Common, and has exceptional olfactory and visual abilities. It has the scent ability and adds +4 on its Perception checks. It has 60-foot darkvision, and it can _see invisibility_. An onyx dog can be used once per week for up to 6 hours. It obeys only its owner.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects_.
  **Golden Lions**: These figurines come in pairs. They become normal adult male lions. If slain in combat, the lions cannot be brought back from statuette form for 1 full week. Otherwise, they can be used once per day for up to 1 hour. They enlarge and shrink upon speaking the command word.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects_.
  **Marble Elephant**: This is the largest of the figurines, the statuette being about the size of a human hand. Upon utterance of the command word, a marble elephant grows to the size and specifications of a true elephant. The animal created from the statuette is fully obedient to the figurine's owner, serving as a beast of burden, a mount, or a combatant. The statuette can be used four times per month for up to 24 hours at a time.; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects_.
  **Ivory Goats**: These figurines come in threes. Each goat of this trio looks slightly different from the others, and each has a different function:
  ; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects_.
  **Obsidian Steed**: This figurine appears to be a small, shapeless lump of black stone. Only careful inspection reveals that it vaguely resembles some form of quadruped. On command, the near-formless piece of obsidian becomes a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy horse with the following additional powers usable once per round at will: _overland flight_, _plane shift_, and _ethereal jaunt_. The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an obsidian steed becomes ethereal or plane shifts, its rider and his gear follow suit. Thus, the user can travel to other planes via this means.; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects_, _etherealness_, _fly_, _plane shift_.
  **Basalt Dragon**: This fist-sized, carved dragon is sculpted from volcanic rock. It becomes either a pseudodragon or a flame drake (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2_ 106), depending on the command word used. The transformation can take place twice per day, with a maximum duration of 2 continuous hours. The pseudodragon can use its telepathy to communicate with its owner over any distance, but not across planes.
  By expending one use of mythic power, the user of the figurine can instead transform the figurine into a young red dragon. If the user is at least 5th tier, she can instead expend two uses of mythic power to transform the figurine into an adult red dragon. If the user is at least 9th tier, she can instead expend four uses of mythic power to transform the figurine into an ancient red dragon. Transforming the figurine into a true dragon renders the figurine powerless for 1 week after the transformation ends.; CL 20th; Craft Wondrous Item, Mythic Crafter, animate objects, _form of the dragon III_, _telepathic bond_."

The statuette can be used four times per month for up to 24 hours at a time.; CL 11th; _Craft Wondrous Item_, _animate objects_.

**Ivory Goats**: These figurines come in threes. Each goat of this trio looks slightly different from the others, and each has a different function:

* The Goat of Traveling: This statuette provides a speedy and enduring _mount_ equal to that of a heavy _[[monsters/Horse|horse]]_ in every way except appearance. The goat can travel for a maximum of 1 day each week—continuously or in any combination of periods totaling 24 hours. At this point, or when the _command_ word is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for no less than 1 day before it can again be used.
* The Goat of Travail: This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of a _nightmare_ except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each successful attack in that round). It can be _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ to life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time.
* The Goat of Terror: When _called_ upon with the proper _command_ word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like _mount_ with the statistics of a light _horse_. However, its rider can employ the goat's horns as weapons (one horn as a +3 heavy _[[items/Weapon/Lance|lance]]_, the other as a +5 _[[items/Weapon/Longsword|longsword]]_). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the goat of terror radiates _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC 16 partial). It can be used once every 2 weeks for up to 3 hours per use.
