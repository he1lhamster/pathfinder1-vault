Description: |
  "This waxy amber substance is typically stored in a lidded container that holds 10 applications. One application is enough to plug both of a creature's ears—applying the wax is a standard action. Once applied, the wax imparts a –2 penalty on Perception checks, but imparts a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws against charm or language-dependant compulsion effects, like _charm monster_, _command_, and _suggestion_. If placed in the ears of a willing or helpless creature currently under a charm or language-dependant compulsion effect, the dose immediately allows the creature to make a new saving throw against the original effect to throw off the charm or compulsion effect (although without the normal +4 bonus granted by the wax if used when a creature is first targeted by such an effect). A single dose of _wax of defiance_ lasts for 1 hour once applied."
