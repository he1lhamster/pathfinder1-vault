Description: |
  "Horticulturists harvest this magical dye from the pulp of rare plants found only in the lushest regions of Tian Xia. Bisby first encountered this dye while visiting the royal courts of the Miracle Samurai during his early adventures as a Pathfinder. He made a point of returning with several bottles, and the decision served him well over the next several decades.
  _Truecolor dye_ produces vibrant colors, yet the actual color that registers varies according to the personality and temperment of the viewer—the viewer's good, neutral, or evil alignment component determines the color he sees. Good viewers see a pleasing gold, while evil viewers see a rich blood red. A neutral viewer sees the dye as its actual color, a dull orange. Centuries ago, _truecolor dye_ was used in the miracle courts of Tian Xia as a way to trick emissaries into revealing their alignments, but its secret has long since been disseminated on the eastern continent and lost its hidden value. A DC 25 Knowledge (geography or nature) check reveals the dye's nature.
  A single vial of _truecolor dye_ is enough to coat a square foot of material, or to ink 5 pages of text. Once applied, _truecolor dye_ is permanent, although it can be washed off with _universal solvent_."
