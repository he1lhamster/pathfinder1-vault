Description: |
  "When activated, this black pebble acts as a limited gravitational singularity. Once the command word is spoken, the pebble delays for 1 round, then pulls all stone or earth within a 5-foot-diameter sphere toward it with irresistible force. This causes small tunnels to collapse inward, creating localized cave-ins. _Imploding stones_ do not affect living creatures, though any creature in the same square as an activated _imploding stone_ is caught in the bury zone of the collapse (_Core Rulebook_ 415). _Imploding stones_ are destroyed when used. Activating an _imploding stone_ is a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity."
