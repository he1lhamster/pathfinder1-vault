Caster level: "3"
Aura: "faint necromancy"
Description: |
  "This plain mask is made of a reflective, dark gray ceramic. When worn, the mask transforms to look like the wearer's skull, and it gradually becomes eerier and more fearsome the closer a viewer gets to the wearer. Whenever a creature enters a square adjacent to the wearer of _Bax's mask_, that creature must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or become shaken for as long as it remains adjacent to the wearer. An affected creature can attempt a new save by moving away from the wearer and reentering a square adjacent to the wearer. A creature that succeeds at the save is immune to the mask's effect for 24 hours. A creature shaken by _Bax's mask_ does not become frightened if affected by the mask again, but other fear effects stack with the creature's shaken condition as normal."

### Description

This plain _[[items/Mundane/Mask|mask]]_ is made of a reflective, dark _[[monsters/Gray|gray]]_ ceramic. When worn, the _mask_ transforms to look like the wearer's skull, and it gradually becomes eerier and more fearsome the closer a viewer gets to the wearer. Whenever a creature enters a square adjacent to the wearer of _[[items/Wondrous Item/Bax's Mask|Bax's mask]]_, that creature must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or become _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for as long as it remains adjacent to the wearer. An affected creature can attempt a new save by moving away from the wearer and reentering a square adjacent to the wearer. A creature that succeeds at the save is immune to the _mask_'s effect for 24 hours. A creature _shaken_ by _Bax's mask_ does not become _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_ if affected by the _mask_ again, but other _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effects stack with the creature's _shaken_ condition as normal.
