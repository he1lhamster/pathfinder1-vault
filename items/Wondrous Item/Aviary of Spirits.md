Title: "Aviary of Spirits"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "16000 gp"
Weight: "5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate divination"
Description: |
  "This reinforced wicker box is decorated with images of owls, ravens, or other cunning birds. It has enough room for up to three Tiny birds to perch inside. Any bird of the animal type stored in the aviary for 24 hours becomes attuned to the aviary's magic, radiating the same aura as the aviary itself. By issuing a command word and concentrating on the bond between their spirits, a user can direct a released bird to fly either to a known location (as with _animal messenger_) or in a specific direction. The bird flies in a direct route at its normal speed. For the next hour, by maintaining physical contact with the aviary, the user can scry through the bird's senses, making the bird the sensor for a _clairaudience/clairvoyance_ spell. While scrying, the user cannot sense her own surroundings, but she can switch between her senses and the bird's as a move action."
