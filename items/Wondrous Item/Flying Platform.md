Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "38000 gp"
Weight: "80 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "12"
Aura: "strong transmutation"
Description: |
  "This sturdy, 10-foot-by-10-foot mithral platform bears five shifting, white runes of Auran incantations related to clouds and swift travel. It functions identically to a _carpet of flying_, except it requires periodic recharging to maintain power. The device can hold up to 5 charges, depleting them at a rate of 1 charge for every hour or partial hour of continuous use. The charges can be restored by casting _overland flight_ onto the runes, which restores 1 charge per casting.
  When in operation, a _flying platform_ also reduces the effect of rushing wind upon those standing on it, producing an _alter winds_ effect to decrease the wind's intensity by one step. A _flying platform_ can normally carry 800 pounds at a speed of 40 feet, but it can carry up to twice this amount with a reduced speed of 30 feet. A _flying platform_ can hover without need for a Fly check, and grants a +5 bonus on any other Fly checks made to operate it. It has hardness 10 and 60 hit points."
