Price: "50000 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate abjuration"
Description: |
  "Forged from adamantine and silver, this heavy lock's shank is large enough to wrap around a humanoid ankle, magically resizing itself to fit any wearer. When the lock is placed on a creature, it immediately suppresses all magical polymorph effects or supernatural shapechanging effects (such as a lycanthrope's change shape ability) affecting the wearer, returning her to her true form. The _lock of formbinding_ does not negate these effects, and creatures return to their altered form if the lock is removed before the effect's duration expires. Creatures targeted by a polymorph effect while wearing a _lock of formbinding_ are affected for only a single round before the lock returns them to their true form. A creature wearing a _lock of formbinding_ can likewise change its own shape, but it must succeed at a DC 16 Will saving throw at the end of each round or revert to its true form; the lock resizes to accommodate whatever new forms its wearer might temporarily assume.
  Attaching the _lock of formbinding_ is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Unwilling creatures must be unconscious, pinned, or helpless before the lock can be attached. The lock has hardness 20 and 20 hit points, and without the key, it can be removed only with a successful DC 30 Strength check, a DC 37 Escape Artist check, or DC 30 Disable Device check."
