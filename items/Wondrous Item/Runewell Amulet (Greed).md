Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "–"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Neck"
Caster level: "20"
Aura: "strong transmutation"
Description: |
  "This amulet of gold and red crystal grants the wearer a +5 enhancement bonus to her natural armor. In addition, the wearer becomes attuned to both the _runewell of greed_ and the _soul lens_ that controls it—allowing the wearer to benefit from the fragmentary souls gathered and absorbed by the _runewell_. As long as the _runewell_ functions, the wearer does not age and has no need for food or water. In addition, she can fly at a speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability and gains fast healing 10. If the _runewell amulet_ is removed, the wearer loses all of these abilities. While this does mean the wearer begins aging normally and must eat and drink, she does not suffer any ill effect from the years that passed or the meals she missed while she wore the amulet."
Destruction: |
  "A _runewell amulet_ must be thrown into an active runewell of an opposing magic (a _runewell of lust_ or a _runewell of pride_ in the case of this particular amulet)—doing so causes the amulet to shatter into four fragments, which then scatter throughout the region that was once Thassilon. If these four fragments can be gathered and placed back in the associated _runewell_ (the _runewell of greed_ in this case), the amulet reforms and returns to full use."
