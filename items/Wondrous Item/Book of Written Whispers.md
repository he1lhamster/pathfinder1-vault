Title: "Book of Written Whispers"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "6000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "3"
Aura: "faint transmutation"
Description: |
  "When first created, a _book of written whispers_ is a relatively slim volume of blank pages. Typically, the cover of a book of written whispers is made to appear nondescript or plain, but the actual design of the book's cover has no bearing on the item's use. This magic item is used to pen secret messages to allies in distant areas. Each book of whispers is linked to a specific activation word. The backside of each of the book's pages can be removed as a standard action; the removed page appears as a normal piece of paper, and the front side of the page that remains in the book of whispers turns uniformly dark gray. The removed page is known as a "secret letter," while the page from which it was removed is known as a "source page." A secret letter doesn't radiate magic, behaving as if under the effects of a _magic aura_ spell.
  At any point thereafter, the owner of the _book of written whispers_ can write a message on the source page. This message can be up to 25 words long, a simple line drawing, or even a straightforward map. When the book's owner writes the activation word in the page's margin (this word does not count against the message's total word count), the message or image inscribed on the page instantly duplicates on the page's linked secret letter, and the actual contents of both the source page and the secret letter are hidden by a _secret page_ effect. The carrier of the secret letter can use the activation word to reveal the actual contents of the message or to restore the misleading secret page contents.
  As a standard action, the owner of a _book of written whispers_ can rip an entire source page out of the book. Doing so causes its linked secret letter to crumble to ash, whether or not any messages have yet been sent. A _book of written whispers_ can be used only 25 times before it is filled; once used, a page cannot be reused to send a new message."

### Description

When first created, a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Book of Written Whispers|book of written whispers]]_ is a relatively slim volume of blank pages. Typically, the cover of a _book of written whispers_ is made to appear nondescript or plain, but the actual design of the book's cover has no bearing on the item's use. This magic item is used to pen secret messages to allies in distant areas. Each book of whispers is linked to a specific activation word. The backside of each of the book's pages can be removed as a standard action; the removed page appears as a normal piece of paper, and the front side of the page that remains in the book of whispers turns uniformly dark _[[monsters/Gray|gray]]_. The removed page is known as a "secret letter," while the page from which it was removed is known as a "source page." A secret letter doesn't radiate magic, behaving as if under the effects of a _[[spells/Magic Aura|magic aura]]_ spell.

At any point thereafter, the owner of the _book of written whispers_ can write a _[[spells/Message|message]]_ on the source page. This _message_ can be up to 25 words long, a simple line drawing, or even a straightforward map. When the book's owner writes the activation word in the page's margin (this word does not count against the _message_'s total word count), the _message_ or image inscribed on the page instantly duplicates on the page's linked secret letter, and the actual contents of both the source page and the secret letter are hidden by a _[[spells/Secret Page|secret page]]_ effect. The carrier of the secret letter can use the activation word to reveal the actual contents of the _message_ or to restore the misleading _secret page_ contents.

As a standard action, the owner of a _book of written whispers_ can rip an entire source page out of the book. Doing so causes its linked secret letter to crumble to ash, whether or not any messages have yet been sent. A _book of written whispers_ can be used only 25 times before it is filled; once used, a page cannot be reused to send a new _message_.
