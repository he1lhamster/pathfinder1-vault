Title: "Nahyndrian Elixir"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "–"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "20"
Aura: "strong conjuration, strong necromancy"
Description: |
  "This thick, syrupy, deep purple elixir contains within it the ability to infuse a drinker with a tiny fragment of a dead demon lord's mythic power. So potent is this elixir that it must be stored in a magically reinforced cold iron flask capped with a mixture of lead and demon ichor—the flask itself is essentially a wondrous magic item that does nothing else and costs 8,000 gp to craft. Even then, the elixir's essence fills a 10-foot-radius area with unholy energies that sicken all living creatures (this is a poison effect with no saving throw). If the flask is opened, this radius expands to 30 feet. A thin sheet of lead, 1 inch of common metal, or 1 foot of stone blocks this effect. Once the flask is opened, the elixir must be imbibed within 1 minute; re-capping the elixir at this point doesn't reset or pause this countdown. If the elixir has not been imbibed in that time, the energy within explodes in a 30-foot-radius burst that deals 15d6 points of unholy damage (Will DC 25 half) to all creatures in the area of effect, destroying the elixir.
  If a creature drinks a _Nahyndrian elixir_, it must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 4d6 points of Constitution drain (demons automatically succeed). If a non-mythic chaotic evil creature succeeds, it undergoes mythic ascension—gaining either the first tier in a mythic path or a mythic rank, at the GM's discretion. A chaotic evil creature that is already mythic treats a _Nahyndrian elixir_ as _nectar of the gods_ (_Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures_ 155).
  _Nahyndrian elixirs_ have the same strange immunity to teleportation effects as _Nahyndrian crystals_."
Destruction: |
  "Merely opening the elixir ensures its destruction. Pouring the contents out triggers its unholy explosion instantly."

### Description

This thick, syrupy, deep purple elixir contains within it the ability to infuse a drinker with a tiny fragment of a dead demon lord's mythic power. So _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ is this elixir that it must be stored in a magically reinforced cold _[[items/Wondrous Item/Iron Flask|iron flask]]_ capped with a mixture of lead and demon ichor—the _[[items/Mundane/Flask|flask]]_ itself is essentially a wondrous magic item that does nothing else and costs 8,000 gp to craft. Even then, the elixir's essence fills a 10-foot-radius area with _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Unholy|unholy]]_ energies that sicken all living creatures (this is a poison effect with no saving throw). If the _flask_ is opened, this radius expands to 30 feet. A thin sheet of lead, 1 inch of common metal, or 1 foot of stone blocks this effect. Once the _flask_ is opened, the elixir must be imbibed within 1 minute; re-capping the elixir at this point doesn't reset or pause this countdown. If the elixir has not been imbibed in that time, the energy within explodes in a 30-foot-radius burst that deals 15d6 points of _unholy_ damage (Will DC 25 half) to all creatures in the area of effect, destroying the elixir.

If a creature drinks a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Nahyndrian Elixir|Nahyndrian elixir]]_, it must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 4d6 points of Constitution drain (demons automatically succeed). If a non-mythic chaotic evil creature succeeds, it undergoes mythic _[[spells/Ascension|ascension]]_—gaining either the first tier in a mythic path or a mythic rank, at the GM's discretion. A chaotic evil creature that is already mythic treats a _Nahyndrian elixir_ as _[[items/Wondrous Item/Nectar of the Gods|nectar of the gods]]_ (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 155).

Nahyndrian elixirs have the same strange _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to teleportation effects as Nahyndrian crystals.

### _[[spells/Destruction|Destruction]]_

Merely opening the elixir ensures its _destruction_. Pouring the contents out triggers its _unholy_ explosion instantly.
