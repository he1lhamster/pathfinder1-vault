  "Despite having the strength and texture of unhewn stone, this pale white harp is sculpted from solid glass. A _harp of slumber_ has several effects when played. At will, the user can produce a _lullaby_ effect by plucking a single string. Up to three times per day, the user can strum the harp to produce a _sleep_ effect.

The DC for these effects increases by 2 against creatures with the giant subtype.
  **Mythic**: A mythic performer can expend one use of mythic power when strumming a _harp of slumber_ in order to augment the effect it creates to _mythic sleep_, or _mythic deep slumber_ if the performer also succeeds at a DC 13 Perform (string instrument) check."
