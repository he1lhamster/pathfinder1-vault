Aura: "moderate enchantment"
Description: |
  "A _scintillating garment_ can become either a tight-fitting tunic of any style or a long, tight dress of any cut. It appears to be made of mist and shimmering silks, hinting at the form and color of the skin beneath without revealing it. When worn, it gives any successful Diplomacy check made by the wearer the chance to increase one target's attitude by one additional step. The wearer chooses a single target affected by her Diplomacy check to make a DC 13 Will save. If the target fails, his attitude improves by one step above the attitude indicated by the check. If the target succeeds, he is unaffected by the garment but his attitude is still adjusted by the successful Diplomacy check as normal. Any target that successfully saves against the garment's effects is immune to its magic for 24 hours. A _scintillating garment_ has no affect on a failed Diplomacy check."
