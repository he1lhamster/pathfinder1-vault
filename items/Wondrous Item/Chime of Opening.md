Title: "Chime of Opening"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "3000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "11"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "A _chime of opening_ is a hollow mithral tube about 1 foot long. When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. A _chime of opening_ also automatically dispels a _hold portal_ spell or even an _arcane lock_ cast by a spellcaster of lower than 15th level.
  The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck and a clear tone rings forth. The wielder can then make a caster level check against the lock or binding, using the chime's caster level in place of her own. The DC of this check is equal to the Disable Device DC to open the lock or binding. Each sounding only opens one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and arcane locked, it takes four successful uses of a _chime of opening_ to get it open. A _silence_ spell negates the power of the device. A brand-new chime can be used a total of 10 times before it cracks and becomes useless."
