  "This 2-foot-long metal rod has a unique sigil on the end. When the sigil is heated in a fire, it can be used to brand a creature or object. Anytime after the branding, a creature can hold the _branding iron of tracking_ and know the direction to the nearest brand, as if using _locate object_ for branded objects or _locate creature_ for branded creatures. The _branding iron of tracking_ only tracks the brand itself, so cutting or scraping off the brand can fool the item."
