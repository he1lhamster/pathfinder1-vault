Title: "Sun Wukong's Puzzle Box"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "15200 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "10"
Aura: "moderate conjuration, moderate illusion"
Description: |
  "The plainly lacquered exterior of this wooden puzzle box cunningly hides the devious clockwork mechanism inside. To those unversed in its abilities, _Sun Wukong's puzzle box_ seems to be little more than a frustratingly impossible child's toy that is adorned with the holy symbol of the Monkey King.
  Once per day as a standard action, the user can unlock _Sun Wukong's puzzle box_ to create two simultaneous effects. First, a shower of golden sparks envelops the user, causing her to become invisible and immediately teleporting her exactly 20 feet in a direction of her choice. Second, a monkey swarm (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2_ 212) bursts from the same square the user left.
  Although the monkey swarm isn't under the control of the user, the monkeys keep at least 20 feet from the user at all times and attempt to surround as many of her opponents as possible. This effect otherwise acts as _mad monkeys_ with a CMB of +12. Both the invisibility effect and the monkey swarm last for 10 rounds."
