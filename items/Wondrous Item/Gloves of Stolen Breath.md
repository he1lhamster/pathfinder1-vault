Price: "54000 gp"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Hands"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate conjuration, moderate necromancy"
Description: |
  "These black leather gloves feel like warm, living skin to the touch. When the wearer delivers a coup de grace that kills an opponent, she can target a single creature within 30 feet that has died within the previous 3 rounds as a free action. The target creature is healed as if with a _breath of life_ spell (regaining 5d8+9 hit points), and if the creature's hit point total is then greater than a negative amount equal to its Constitution score, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total. As with the _breath of life_ spell, creatures brought back to life gain a temporary negative level that lasts for 1 day, but this effect can save creatures slain by death effects. This effect cannot damage undead creatures. The opponent killed by the coup de grace must have a number of Hit Dice equal to or greater than the target slain creature's Hit Dice or the gloves' ability is not triggered."
