Title: "Fate-Woven Braid of the Norns"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "9000 gp"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Wrists"
Caster level: "16"
Aura: "strong abjuration, strong evocation"
Description: |
  "At first glance, this circlet of plaited hair interwoven with a single gold thread appears to be nothing more than a personal memento or a lover's token. Closer examination reveals that each strand of hair seems to have neither a beginning nor an end. Most of these braids are blonde in color, but other hues are not unknown.
  Up to three times per day, the wearer of a _fate-woven braid of the norns_ can potentially negate a disastrous turn of fortune. Upon rolling a natural 1 on a saving throw or after failing a saving throw against a death effect, the wearer can activate the braid as a free action to reroll the saving throw.
  The golden thread is vulnerable to severe twists of fate, though. If the result of any reroll obtained by the braid is ever a natural 20, the golden thread frays, permanently reducing the braid's daily reroll uses by one. If all three daily uses are eliminated in this manner, the golden thread snaps and the _fate-woven braid of the norns_ falls apart into a nonmagical pile of wispy gray hair. A _fate-woven braid of the norns_ uses up the entire wrists slot, even though the user wears only one at a time. The user can't use another item (even another _fate-woven braid of the norns_) that also uses the wrists slot."
