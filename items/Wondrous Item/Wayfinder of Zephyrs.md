  "Swirling green and blue patterns bedeck the surface of this fine oak _wayfinder_, whose compass and needle are made of light polished steel engraved with themes of Gozreh's oceanic aspect.

A _wayfinder of zephyrs_ grants its bearer a +5 circumstance bonus on Profession (sailor) checks. Once per day, the bearer of a _wayfinder of zephyrs_ can move the needle to change the direction the wind is traveling toward any direction on the compass. Optionally, the wielder may also increase or decrease the wind's intensity by one step (_Core Rulebook_ 439) while changing its direction. A _wayfinder of zephyrs_ has no effect on magical wind effects other than indicating the direction they are traveling."
