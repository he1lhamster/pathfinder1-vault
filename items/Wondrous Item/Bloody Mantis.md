Price: "52500 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Head"
Caster level: "11"
Aura: "moderate divination, moderate enchantment, moderate illusion"
Description: |
  "The antennae on this mask of the mantis (_Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide_ 298) have been truncated. Bloody Mantis has three charges per day, which replenish automatically every 24 hours. Each charge grants the wearer two of the following abilities for 30 minutes: darkvision to a range of 60 feet, the effects of _see invisibility_, the effects of _deathwatch_, or a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks. Additionally, three times per day the wearer can also use _disguise self_, although he always retains the mask's nublike antennae and must cover them with her hair or a hood to conceal them. Finally, if the wearer strikes a target with a melee attack during a surprise round, the target can't speak or cast spells with verbal components for 1 round.
  _Bloody Mantis_ contains the spirit of a haughty assassin lord, and has the special purpose of slaying insurrectionists, traitors, and other challengers to rightful monarchs. _Bloody Mantis_ can use _geas/quest_ once per day, but it rarely does so at the behest of its wearer. Instead, the mask targets its wearer with the effect whenever it dominates the wearer in a personality conflict, tasking the wearer to assassinate a target appropriate for its special purpose. So long as the wearer pursues this goal, _Bloody Mantis_ uses its abilities to aid the wearer. The mask can spend its charges to improve its own senses rather than the wearer's, and is likely to waste charges in this way if its wearer resists its will."
