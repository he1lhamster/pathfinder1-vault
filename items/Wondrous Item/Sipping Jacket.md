Weight: "5 lbs."

Description: |
  "Absorbent fibers line this heavy canvas coat. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can pour a potion onto this lining, suffusing it into the coat. If the potion has an instantaneous duration, the wearer can activate the coat as a swift action to consume the potion. If the potion's duration is measured in rounds, the wearer can activate the coat as a swift action to gain the potion's benefits for 1 round, repeating as desired each round until the potion's entire duration has been used. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. The coat absorbs only potions with instantaneous or round-based durations, and only those which affect creatures (for example, it does not work on oils). Once the coat absorbs a potion, the potion cannot be retrieved from it, only used as described above. The absorbed potion loses its powers after 24 hours, even if unused."
