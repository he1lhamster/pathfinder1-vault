Title: "Talons of Leng"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "67000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Hands"
Caster level: "15"
Aura: "strong transmutation"
Description: |
  "Finely laid gold filigree lines these ornately worked talons. Once worn, the _talons of Leng_ grant the wearer two natural claw attacks, both with a +3 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage. A hit from one of the talons deals 1d4 points of damage. On a critical hit, the talons deal ×3 damage and force the victim to make a DC 20 Will save. Failing this save renders the target permanently insane (as per the spell _insanity_), while success leaves the target confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect.
  The wearer of the _talons of Leng_ is immune to the spells _confusion_ and _insanity_, as well as to any spell or any ability that produces similar effects. For as long as he wears the talons, however, his Wisdom is reduced by 2, as alien voices constantly whisper through his head. The _talons of Leng_ do not interfere with spellcasting, the use of handheld items, or wielding other weapons (though a wielder cannot make an attack with a claw that's holding another weapon or item). If the wielder attacks only with the talons, they are treated as a primary attack, but if he attacks with a weapon or other natural attack, the claws are treated as secondary attacks and take a –5 penalty on their attack roll."
