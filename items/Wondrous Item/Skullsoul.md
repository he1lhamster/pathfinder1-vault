Caster level: "18"
Aura: "strong necromancy"
Description: |
  "This grim, alabaster figurine is the size of a human skull with an elaborately sculpted base. The _Skullsoul_ is inert until it is bonded with a living creature. It then becomes a powerful and never-questioning companion. The _Skullsoul_ functions as a demilich (_Bestiary 3_ 66) without the devour soul, rejuvenation, telekinetic storm, and torpor abilities, and with a hardness of 10. It is under the complete control of whoever bonds with the skull. Bonding with the _Skullsoul_ is a ritual that takes 24 hours to perform, and doing so is an evil act. Paladins and good clerics who do so become ex-paladins and ex-clerics respectively. If they wish to atone, they must intercede with their deities (expending 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings) and must promise to contain the skull."
Destruction: |
  "The _Skullsoul_ cannot be destroyed but it can be contained. As long as the _Skullsoul_ stays pierced by either a weapon with the _vorpal_ special ability or a _holy avenger_, it is contained and entirely inert until the sword is removed."
