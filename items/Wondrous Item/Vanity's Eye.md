Description: |
  "This pair of fine, silver hand mirrors secretly steals the confidence and finesse of one bearer and transfers them to another. Two distinct components make up vanity's eye: a silver hand mirror set with flawless glass (the master) and a silver hand mirror set with slightly warped glass (the slave).
  The mirrors have no effect until one looks into the slave mirror. Once a creature looks into the slave mirror, it must make a DC 20 Will save or be deceived by the mirror into believing that it has magically made him more dashing, suave, and glib. In truth, however, the slave mirror is cursed and steals the bearer's Charisma, causing him to take a –6 penalty to his Charisma score. The bearer is unaware of this penalty, and will not willingly part with the magical mirror. This penalty persists for as long as the mirror's curse lasts. Should the mirror be lost or taken, the bearer does all he can to retrieve the mirror. Only _break enchantment_, _limited wish_, _remove curse_, _miracle_, or _wish_ can make the mirror's holder willingly part with the item and return his stolen Charisma. Breaking the slave mirror also restores the victim's Charisma. The slave mirror can only affect one creature at a time and has no affect on other creatures that look into it.
  For as long as the slave mirror imposes a Charisma penalty upon a victim, the bearer of the master mirror gains a +6 enhancement bonus to his Charisma. This bonus applies as long as the master mirror's bearer is within 10 feet of the mirror. If the master mirror is destroyed, its bearer loses this bonus and the slave mirror is rendered inert, freeing any victim and restoring his Charisma."

### Description

This pair of fine, silver hand mirrors secretly steals the confidence and finesse of one bearer and transfers them to another. Two distinct components make up _[[items/Wondrous Item/Vanity's Eye|vanity's eye]]_: a silver hand _[[items/Mundane/Mirror|mirror]]_ set with flawless glass (the master) and a silver hand _mirror_ set with slightly warped glass (the _[[items/Mundane/Slave|slave]]_).

The mirrors have no effect until one looks into the _slave_ _mirror_. Once a creature looks into the _slave_ _mirror_, it must make a DC 20 Will save or be deceived by the _mirror_ into believing that it has magically made him more dashing, suave, and glib. In truth, however, the _slave_ _mirror_ is cursed and steals the bearer's Charisma, causing him to take a –6 penalty to his Charisma score. The bearer is unaware of this penalty, and will not willingly part with the magical _mirror_. This penalty persists for as long as the _mirror_'s curse lasts. Should the _mirror_ be lost or taken, the bearer does all he can to retrieve the _mirror_. Only _[[spells/Break Enchantment|break enchantment]]_, _[[spells/Limited Wish|limited wish]]_, _[[spells/Remove Curse|remove curse]]_, _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_, or _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ can make the _mirror_'s holder willingly part with the item and return his stolen Charisma. _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Breaking|Breaking]]_ the _slave_ _mirror_ also restores the victim's Charisma. The _slave_ _mirror_ can only affect one creature at a time and has no affect on other creatures that look into it.

For as long as the _slave_ _mirror_ imposes a Charisma penalty upon a victim, the bearer of the master _mirror_ gains a +6 enhancement bonus to his Charisma. This bonus applies as long as the master _mirror_'s bearer is within 10 feet of the _mirror_. If the master _mirror_ is destroyed, its bearer loses this bonus and the _slave_ _mirror_ is rendered inert, freeing any victim and restoring his Charisma.
