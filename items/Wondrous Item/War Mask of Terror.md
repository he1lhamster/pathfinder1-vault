  "Shamans and warriors of many of the indigenous tribes of western Garund add to their fierceness and mystique by wearing wooden masks that bear terrifying visages of demonic spirits. A war mask is considered sacred and personal, and is often handed down to the next generation when a wearer dies. Individual masks are often notorious, and many tribesfolk can readily identify masks of other tribes with a DC 15 Knowledge (local) check.
  A _war mask of terror_ provides its wearer with a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate checks and a +1 deflection bonus to Armor Class. In addition, the wearer may cast _scare_ once per day.
  Other war masks exist with different abilities; some have higher deflection bonuses, while others can cast _bull's strength_, _fear_, or _flesh to stone_ instead of _scare_."
