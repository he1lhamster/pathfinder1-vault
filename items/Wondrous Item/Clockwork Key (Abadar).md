Description: |
  "A _clockwork key_ has two uses, but one functions only if Abadar is your patron. Constructs avoid attacking the bearer of the _clockwork key_, directing their attacks toward other targets if possible, unless they are directly threatened by the bearer or are ordered by their creator to attack. If there are no targets other than a _clockwork key's_ bearer, a construct will act and attack as normal. If Abadar is your patron, you can use the _clockwork key_ as an improvised weapon that deals 1d2 points of damage. If you strike a construct with a _clockwork key_, it takes 1d4 points of damage and must make a DC 12 Will save. If the construct fails, it is paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. Once the key has successfully paralyzed a construct, it is destroyed."
