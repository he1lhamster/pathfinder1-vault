A _visage of the bound_ has no effect on outsiders already summoned or on summoning spells cast by other creatures. Removing the mask immediately releases a bound outsider.

Effects that extend the duration of a _summon monster_ spell (such a the Extend Spell metamagic feat or the conjurer's summoner's charm class ability) have no effect on the duration of a spell contained by a _visage of the bound_. Outsiders who are opposed to one or more axes of the wearer's alignment cannot be housed within a _visage of the bound_."

Once per day when the wearer casts a _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ monster spell, he may choose to house the summoned outsider within the _[[items/Wondrous Item/Visage of the Bound|visage of the bound]]_ rather than conjuring it onto the Material Plane. For the spell's duration, the wearer can use of any of the bound outsider's _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ as if they were his own. A _visage of the bound_ has no effect on outsiders already summoned or on summoning spells cast by other creatures. Removing the _[[items/Mundane/Mask|mask]]_ immediately releases a bound outsider.

Effects that extend the duration of a _summon_ monster spell (such a the _[[feats/Extend Spell|Extend Spell]]_ metamagic feat or the conjurer's _summoner_'s charm class ability) have no effect on the duration of a spell contained by a _visage of the bound_.
