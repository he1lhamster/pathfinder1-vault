Aura: "strong universal"
Description: |
  "The _beacon of true faith_ takes the form of an ornate torch made of electrum. It holds an undying magical flame that requires no fuel or air, and in the hands of most creatures it simply functions as an everburning torch. When held by a divine spellcaster, an outsider with an alignment subtype, or a creature of strong religious faith (GM's discretion, but usually requiring a feat or trait reflecting this devotion), the beacon gains additional powers based on the bearer's alignment. For example, a lawful good paladin gains access to the lawful and good powers, but a neutral cleric gains access to no powers. All of these are command-word activated.
  _Chaotic (violet flame)_: _Word of chaos_ once per day on command.
  _Good (white flame)_: Allies within 30 feet of the beacon gain the benefits of _protection from evil_ and _heroism_.
  _Evil (black flame)_: Bearer is constantly under the effect of _protection from good_ and may use _harm_ twice per day.
  _Lawful (golden flame)_: _Dictum_ once per day on command."
Destruction: |
  "The _beacon of true faith_ is destroyed if its bearer turns against the worship of his deity to willingly embrace an opposite alignment."
