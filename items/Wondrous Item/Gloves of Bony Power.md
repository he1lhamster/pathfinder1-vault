  "These black gloves are decorated with images of white bones, as if revealing the bones within the wearer's hands. The left glove can be used once per day to create a _spectral hand_, which makes the bony hand image on that glove slide off and manifest as a ghostly skeletal hand for the duration of the effect. The right glove can be used once per day to deliver an _inflict moderate wounds_ spell, which gives that hand's bones a pale, sickly glow until the touch is delivered or discharged. If the wearer is a living creature, he can also use the right glove on himself to cast _cure moderate wounds_ instead of _inflict moderate wounds_."
