Weight: "0.5 lbs."

Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate necromancy"
Description: |
  "This poorly formed wax figure resembles an unfinished sculpt of a humanoid. It can be bound to a living humanoid in a similar way to a _ganji doll_, but must be sculpted into the shape of that humanoid and have a piece of that creature's hair, teeth, blood, bone, or flesh pressed into the wax. Those familiar with the target notice the _waxen image's_ resemblance to the target with a DC 15 Perception check.
  A _waxen image_ can be blinded, damaged, or targeted with a touch spell in the same way as a _ganji doll_, except that the bound creature is unaffected if it's farther than 100 feet from the _waxen image_. A _waxen image_ can be used only once, and melts as soon as it's used."
