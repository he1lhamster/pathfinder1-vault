Description: |
  "This cone has openings at both ends and a large mouthpiece on the small end, and is crafted from brass hoops and sheets of leather and painted garish colors. Anyone holding the _mountebank's megaphone_ in one hand can speak through it to make his voice up to 10 times louder, allowing him to be understood across a large crowd. If the megaphone's holder has the bardic performance class feature, he can treat any space within a 30-foot cone in front of him as the point of origin for any bardic performance that usually centers on the performer. Projecting a bardic performance through the megaphone takes additional effort, costing double the normal number of rounds. If the user moves from his current location, any bardic performance he is projecting through the megaphone immediately ends, even if his new position is still within range."
