Description: |
  "The _empty hands_ are an innocuous looking pair of wellcrafted gloves made of soft, tanned brown leather. As a standard action, the wearer can cause any weapon or item he holds to become invisible for 3 minutes, during which it is clear the wearer is holding something, but it's not possible to see exactly what it is. The wearer gains a +1 circumstance bonus on attack rolls with an invisible weapon, a +5 circumstance bonus on opposed Bluff checks made to feint in combat or claim to be unarmed, and a +10 circumstance bonus on opposed Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a weapon or item. This invisibility can be dismissed as a free action. The 3 minutes a held item is invisible need not be consecutive, but must be expended in 1-minute increments. Empty hands grant no bonuses against foes able to see invisible objects, as per spells like _see invisibility_ or _true seeing_. _Empty hands_ can only affect one item at a time, even if one item is held in each hand."
