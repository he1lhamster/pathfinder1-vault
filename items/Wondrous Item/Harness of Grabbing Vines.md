Description: |
  "This ivy harness allows the wearer's wings to manipulate objects or grab on to handholds, as if they were extra arms, as long as the wearer isn't flying. They do not grant additional attacks, but they can be used to hold items or perform combat maneuvers without requiring the wearer's hands. On command, the harness grows roots that anchor the wearer in place much like _anchored step_. When thus anchored, the wearer can climb using only legs and wings with a climb speed equal to the wearer's reduced base speed. The benefits of _anchored step_ apply while the wearer is climbing with the roots."
