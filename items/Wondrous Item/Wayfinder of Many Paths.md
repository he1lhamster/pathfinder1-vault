Aura: "strong conjuration"
Description: |
  "The _Wayfinder of Many Paths_ behaves like a normal _wayfinder_ (_Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide_ 299), allowing it to shine (as the _light_ spell) on command and granting its user a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to avoid getting lost. It has a small indentation designed to hold a single _ioun stone_, and when an _ioun stone_ is placed within, the owner of the _wayfinder_ gains the stone's normal benefits as if it were orbiting his head.
  Once per day on command, a _Wayfinder of Many Paths_ with an implanted _ioun stone_ can be used to create a 5-to-20-foot-diameter gateway, similar to the spell _gate_. The exact destination depends on the type of _ioun stone_ slotted into the _wayfinder_; _ioun stones_ of the same type always lead to the same location. The gateway remains open for up to 18 rounds, but the user can drain the socketed _ioun stone_, rendering it dull gray and powerless, to keep the gateway open for up to 18 additional rounds. If fitted with an _ioun stone_ while in that stone's attuned location, a _Wayfinder of Many Paths_ can open a gateway back to the location in which it was last used, allowing its user to make a return trip after 24 hours."

### Description

The _[[items/Wondrous Item/Wayfinder of Many Paths|Wayfinder of Many Paths]]_ behaves like a normal _[[items/Wondrous Item/Wayfinder|wayfinder]]_ (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 299), allowing it to shine (as the light spell) on _[[spells/Command|command]]_ and granting its user a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to avoid getting lost. It has a small indentation designed to hold a single ioun stone, and when an ioun stone is placed within, the owner of the _wayfinder_ gains the stone's normal benefits as if it were orbiting his head.

Once per day on _command_, a _Wayfinder of Many Paths_ with an implanted ioun stone can be used to create a 5-to-20-foot-diameter gateway, similar to the spell _[[spells/Gate|gate]]_. The exact destination depends on the type of ioun stone slotted into the _wayfinder_; ioun stones of the same type always lead to the same location. The gateway remains open for up to 18 rounds, but the user can drain the socketed ioun stone, rendering it dull _[[monsters/Gray|gray]]_ and powerless, to keep the gateway open for up to 18 additional rounds. If fitted with an ioun stone while in that stone's attuned location, a _Wayfinder of Many Paths_ can open a gateway back to the location in which it was last used, allowing its user to make a return _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ after 24 hours.
