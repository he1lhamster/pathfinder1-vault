### Description

This mithral cap includes prominent guards for the eyes and nose. The helmet was forged under duress by a dwarven smith to further the ambitions of his mad brother. The _[[items/Wondrous Item/Tarnhelm|Tarnhelm]]_ has the following powers.

* The wearer gains the shapechanger subtype.
* The wearer gains _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to _[[spells/Polymorph|polymorph]]_ effects, except ones he chooses to allow to affect him.
* At will, the wearer can use greater _[[spells/Invisibility|invisibility]]_ as a spell-like ability for as long a duration as desired.
* At will, the wearer can change his appearance in the same fashion as a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Hat of Disguise|hat of disguise]]_, with a DC 25 Will save required to disbelieve the illusion. If the _Tarnhelm_ is used to create a disguise, the wearer receives a +25 bonus on the Disguise check.
* Three times per day, the wearer can use greater teleport, exactly as if he had cast the spell of the same name. The wearer can teleport additional times by expending one use of mythic power per teleport.
* Three times per day, the wearer can assume the form of an animal as though he had cast _[[spells/Beast Shape IV|beast shape IV]]_, except the duration lasts until the effect is dismissed or dispelled. The wearer can _[[universal monster rules/Change Shape|change shape]]_ additional times by expending one use of mythic power per _[[spells/Transformation|transformation]]_.
* By expending two uses of mythic power, the wearer can assume the form of Gargantuan chromatic or metallic dragon. The effect lasts until dispelled or dismissed. He gains a +14 size bonus to Strength, a +12 size bonus to Constitution, a +10 natural armor bonus, a fly speed of 150 feet (poor), _[[universal monster rules/Blindsense|blindsense]]_ 90 feet, _[[spells/Darkvision|darkvision]]_ 180 feet, a _[[universal monster rules/Breath Weapon|breath weapon]]_, DR 15/magic, _[[universal monster rules/Frightful Presence|frightful presence]]_ (DC 23), one bite (4d6), two claws (2d8), two wing attacks (2d6), and one tail slap (2d8). All his breath weapons deal 16d8 points of damage and allow a Reflex save (DC 10 plus his tier plus his Constitution modifier) for half damage. This ability otherwise functions as _[[spells/Form of the Dragon III|form of the dragon III]]_.
