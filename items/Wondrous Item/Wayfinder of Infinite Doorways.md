  "This bronze _wayfinder_ is decorated with garnets and emeralds, and even without its magical properties would be worth a small fortune. A _wayfinder of infinite doorways_ has 10 charges; these charges automatically replenish at a rate of 1 charge every 24 hours. The _wayfinder_ has one _ioun stone_ slot—as a standard action, the user can drain the power of an _ioun stone_ inserted in the _wayfinder_ to restore a number of charges equal to the _ioun stone's_ cost divided by 2,000 (thus, draining an _ioun stone_ worth 8,000 points would instantly restore 4 charges). The item can be used to activate any of the following powers as a standard action that expends a variable number of charges."

### Description

This bronze _[[items/Wondrous Item/Wayfinder|wayfinder]]_ is decorated with garnets and emeralds, and even without its magical properties would be worth a small fortune. A _[[items/Wondrous Item/Wayfinder of Infinite Doorways|wayfinder of infinite doorways]]_ has 10 charges; these charges automatically replenish at a rate of 1 charge every 24 hours. The _wayfinder_ has one ioun stone slot—as a standard action, the user can drain the power of an ioun stone inserted in the _wayfinder_ to restore a number of charges equal to the ioun stone's cost divided by 2,000 (thus, draining an ioun stone worth 8,000 points would instantly restore 4 charges). The item can be used to activate any of the following powers as a standard action that expends a variable number of charges.

* The _wayfinder of infinite doorways_ can be used cast _[[spells/Detect Secret Doors|detect secret doors]]_. Using the item this way costs no charges, but can only be done if at least 1 charge remains in the _wayfinder_.
* It can be used to cast _[[spells/Knock|knock]]_ at the cost of 1 charge.
* It can be used to cast _[[spells/Dimension Door|dimension door]]_ at the cost of 2 charges.
* The _wayfinder of infinite doorways_ can be used to transform any regular door within 10 feet into a portal that functions as a _[[spells/Word of Recall|word of recall]]_, causing any creatures that step through the targeted doorway to step out of another doorway that has been preselected. If no target doorway has been selected, this use of the _wayfinder_ fails. Using the _wayfinder_ in this way costs 4 charges. Attuning the _wayfinder_ to a destination doorway requires a full-round action and 1 charge, and the user must be standing within the doorway when she does so.
