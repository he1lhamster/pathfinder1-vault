  These large goggles feature adjustable lenses. When calibrated correctly, they sense the thoughts of a particular creature and send them into the wearer's mind. If the wearer spends 3 rounds studying a creature, spending a standard action each round to calibrate the lenses, she may scan a target's surface thoughts as if she had spent 3 rounds studying the target with _detect thoughts_. The target can attempt a DC 13 Will save to negate the effect. The wearer must spend three consecutive standard actions each time she wishes to read the mind of a new creature.
  If the wearer is an android, he can spend a nanite surge to immediately detect surface thoughts instead of concentrating for 3 rounds."
