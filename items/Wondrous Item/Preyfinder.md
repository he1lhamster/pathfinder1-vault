Description: |
  "These sturdy brass compasses are often painted blood red and etched with images of wolves, lions, crocodiles, or sharks stalking their prey. Though _preyfinders_ function as standard compasses (_Ultimate Equipment_ 62), making them useful tools for navigation, they also have the power to magically identify and track down creatures.
  To use a _preyfinder_, its bearer must (as a standard action) take a drop of blood from a creature, smear it onto the compass's glass faceplate, and then touch the compass to his head. The blood must be no more than 1 week old, and can come from a living or dead creature, though a living or undead target can attempt a DC 18 Will save to resist the _preyfinder's_ tracking ability. If the Will save is successful, the _preyfinder_ can't identify or locate the creature, and none of the _preyfinder's_ magical powers function for 24 hours. If the creature fails the Will save, the _preyfinder_ telepathically provides its bearer with an image of the creature to which the drop of blood belonged and marks the creature as the _preyfinder's_ quarry.
  After a creature is marked as the _preyfinder's_ quarry, the bearer can spend a standard action to magically divine the creature's current location. As long as the quarry is no more than 100 miles away, the _preyfinder_ provides a series of telepathic images to the bearer, who is then able to determine the direction toward and exact distance to the quarry. This detection ability can be fooled by _mislead_, _nondetection_, and _polymorph_ spells and effects.
  A _preyfinder_ can have only one creature designated as its quarry at any one time. If the bearer adds a new drop of blood, the old quarry is replaced by the new one. The bearer can also spend a full-round action to remove a quarry designation from the _preyfinder_.
  When used by a slayer with the studied target class feature, a _preyfinder_ grants the slayer a +1 insight bonus on all attack and damage rolls made against a creature designated as the _preyfinder's_ quarry. Additionally, instead of designating another creature as its quarry, a slayer can add a drop of his own blood to the _preyfinder_ (a standard action) to gain a +2 morale bonus on all attack rolls, saves, and skill checks he attempts for 1 minute. After a slayer adds a drop of his own blood to the _preyfinder_, none of the _preyfinder's_ magical powers functions for 24 hours."
