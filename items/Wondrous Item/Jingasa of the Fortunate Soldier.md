  "This conical iron jingasa, or war hat, grants the wearer a +1 deflection bonus to AC. When struck by a critical hit or sneak attack, the wearer can spend an immediate action to negate the critical hit or sneak attack (similar to the _fortification_ armor special ability, but without requiring a roll). The damage is instead rolled normally. This ability functions only once, though the jingasa continues to grant its deflection bonus even after the other ability is expended."
