Description: |
  "These aged charts of thick, yellowed parchment display rough representations of the Shackles' major islands and the sea lanes between them. The detailed markings on these charts grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Profession (sailor) or Survival checks to navigate within the Shackles.
  In addition, a multitude of wrinkles, stains, and blemishes mar the charts' surfaces. Anyone meticulously studying the charts notices that these markings shift over time. The creases, smudges, and blotches on the map represent real weather conditions (such as clouds, rain, and wind) in the region, allowing an informed observer to determine the current weather patterns over the islands of the Shackles. The charts grant a +4 competence bonus on Survival checks made to predict future weather conditions and a +2 competence bonus on Survival checks to gain a bonus on Fortitude saves against severe weather.
  Finally, the pilot of a wind-propelled ship can make a DC 20 Profession (sailor) check to plot a course within the Shackles using the charts. If the check is successful, the charts grant the ship a +10% enhancement bonus to its waterborne speed as long as it follows the plotted course.
  All of the charts' benefits only apply within the geographic region of the Shackles. GMs with access to the _Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Skull &amp; Shackles Map Folio _might use the elaborate player map of the Shackles included therein to represent this item."
