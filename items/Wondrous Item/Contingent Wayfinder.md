Price: "132000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "11"
Aura: "moderate evocation"
Description: |
  "This _wayfinder_ is constructed of delicate ivory. Its face constantly reshapes to form a relief of its bearer, and is capable of changing as quickly as two creatures can pass the _wayfinder_ back and forth. The socket in which an _ioun stone_ could normally be placed is instead filled with a permanently fixed gem that functions as a _ring of minor spell storing_. After wielding this _wayfinder_ for 24 hours, its wielder can designate a series of conditions upon which the _wayfinder_ will cast the highest-level spell stored in the gem with the wearer as the spell's target, as though it were using the _contingency_ spell. For example, the wielder of a _contingent wayfinder_ could place a _cure moderate wounds_ spell in the _wayfinder's_ gem, then specify that if she ever falls unconscious because of lethal damage, the spell must be cast on her.
  Once used in such a manner, the _wayfinder_ requires 1 month to recharge its _contingency_ effect, though a new spell can be cast into the enclosed gem at any time during this period. If the conditions of the _contingency_ effect are not met within 1 week of when they were assigned, the user can change the conditions, though the spell stored in the gem can't be changed until it has been cast."
