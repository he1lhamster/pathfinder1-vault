Description: |
  "This dust looks like _dust of appearance_ and is typically stored in the same manner. A creature or object touched by it becomes invisible (as _greater invisibility_). Normal vision can't see dusted creatures or objects, nor can they be detected by magical means, including _see invisibility_ or _invisibility purge_. _Dust of appearance_, however, does reveal people and objects made invisible by _dust of disappearance_. Other factors, such as sound and smell, also allow possible detection. The _greater invisibility_ bestowed by the dust lasts for 2d6 rounds. The invisible creature doesn't know when the duration will end."
