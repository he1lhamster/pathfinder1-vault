  "Death cults such as the Whispering Way use this elixir to prevent their enemies from stealing their members' secrets, even after death. Elite cultists typically imbibe _deathgag elixir_ as part of an elaborate initiation ritual when they are promoted to high-ranking positions in the cult. Thereafter, should the imbiber fall below –1 hit point, the elixir triggers the release of a fatal poison that throws him into wild convulsions. The victim begins foaming at the mouth, and his eyes turn blood red. Soon after, the victim's entire jaw dissolves, rendering him immune to _speak with dead_ spells. Prior to the victim's death, only a _limited wish_, _miracle_, or _wish_ spell can undo the effects of the elixir.
