This small harp is carved from _[[monsters/Whale|whale]]_ ivory, and its frame is filigreed with delicate gold patterns depicting winds and clouds. Up to three times per day as a standard action, you can use a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Harp of Storms|harp of storms]]_ to surround yourself with an aura of brisk wind that grants you a 20% miss chance against all ranged attacks. This wind cloak effect lasts for 1 minute. At any time during that minute, you may strike additional notes on the _harp of storms_ in order to produce one of the following three effects.

* _[[spells/Air Walk|Air Walk]]_: You cause the winds to lift you off the ground, granting you the effects of an _air walk_ spell for 1 round. This is normally a move action, but if you succeed at a DC 15 Perform (strings) check, it is a swift action.
* _[[spells/Gust Of Wind|Gust of Wind]]_: You can direct the winds surrounding you to duplicate the effects of a _gust of wind_ spell. This is a standard action.
* Lightning Strike: As a standard action, make a Perform (strings) check. You cause a bolt of lightning to strike a single foe within 30 feet, dealing an amount of electricity damage equal to the result of your Perform (strings) check. The target gets a DC 15 Reflex save to halve the damage caused by this lightning strike.
