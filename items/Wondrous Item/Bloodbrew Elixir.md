Description: |
  "This ruby red wine carries an aroma of fresh-spilled blood with a persistent finish tasting of iron and scarberries. Anyone who drinks the concoction gains 1d10+3 temporary hit points for 1 hour. In addition, an enslaved vampire or vampire spawn who drinks the elixir is freed from its creator's control for 1 hour, becoming a free-willed undead creature for that time. At the end of the hour, the vampire is once again enslaved under its creator's control.
  _Bloodbrew elixir_ is highly addictive to vampires, and any vampire who drinks it must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or become addicted to the _bloodbrew_. Thereafter, the vampire must drink a new dose of _bloodbrew_ every day, or take a –2 penalty to Dex, Con, Str, and Wis and lose her fast healing ability, until a new dose is taken. The addiction can only be cured with greater restoration, or the vampire must make three consecutive saves, one per day, against the elixir's DC, after a day of not taking the drug. Should the vampire take a new dose of the elixir before the addiction is cured, any past successful saves are negated.
  A living creature who drinks the elixir gains the temporary hit points, but takes a –2 penalty on saves against energy drain and negative energy effects, including channeled negative energy, for 1 hour. _Bloodbrew elixir_ is not addictive to living creatures."
