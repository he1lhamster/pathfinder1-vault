Title: "Hurricane Crown"

Price: "125000 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Head"
Caster level: "17"
Aura: "strong conjuration, strong evocation"
Description: |
  "A band of golden skulls encircles this golden crown, and smaller skulls top its points. Forged for the first Hurricane King, Turpin Irons, when he sailed out of the Eye of Abendego more than 100 years ago to claim rulership over the Shackles, the _Hurricane Crown_ has been passed down (or taken by force) from one Hurricane King to the next ever since. On command, the _Hurricane Crown_ changes its shape and appearance to assume the form of a normal piece of headwear (such as a hat or scarf). The crown retains all its properties (including weight) when so disguised. Only a _true seeing_ spell or similar magic reveals the true nature of the crown when disguised.
  The wearer of the _Hurricane Crown_ gains a +5 competence bonus on Profession (sailor) checks and Survival checks made to determine direction or predict the weather at sea, and he can see normally through fog, mist, smoke, and precipitation or weather effects, whether natural or magical. Once per day, the wearer can cast _control winds_; if the wearer is standing on a ship, the ship and any creatures aboard it are unaffected by the controlled winds unless the wearer wishes to affect them, even if the ship's area is larger than the spell's unaffected area. In addition, once per day, the wearer of the _Hurricane Crown_ can surround himself in either a shroud of elemental water or supernatural winds, as the _seamantle_ or _winds of vengeance_ spells (_Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide_ 241, 256).
  Lastly, the wearer of the _Hurricane Crown_ can create a single-use _phase door_ in the rock of Lucrehold to access the sea caves and Hidden Harbor beneath the island (see page 26). If the crown's wearer is standing on a ship, the _phase door_ is large enough to accommodate the ship and any creatures on it. The _phase door_ remains invisible and inaccessible to all other creatures and ships, and otherwise functions as a normal _phase door_. This ability can be used at will."
