Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate abjuration"
Description: |
  "This silver powder typically comes in a fist-sized leather bag. When poured on the ground, the dust animates over the course of 1 round to scribble silver thaumaturgic script and symbols in a circular pattern with a 20-foot radius. This circle acts as the perfectly scribed special diagram of a _magic circle against chaos_, _evil_, _good_, or _law_ and bars extradimensional movement as if the user had attached _dimensional anchor_ to the magic circle. The scribed circle lasts 24 hours. A bag of _thaumaturgic powder_ can be used only once.
  An extraplanar creature of the appropriate alignment that is called or summoned into the circle can attempt to break through the circle once during the circle's duration, just as if trying to break free from a _lesser planar binding_ spell with either its spell resistance or a DC 26 Charisma check."
