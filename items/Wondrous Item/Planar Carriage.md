Description: |
  "_Planar carriages_ are large metal-and-wood vehicles painted or styled to reflect the appearance of a certain plane. When not being used to travel to another plane, a planar carriage functions as a heavy wagon, except for the following changes: instead of muscle propulsion, a planar carriage has built-in magic propulsion that requires a driver to use Spellcraft or Use Magic Device for driving checks. A planar carriage has a maximum speed of 90 feet and an acceleration of 30 feet. Its driving device is a magic item (a 5-foot magical sphere) that occupies the forwardmost square, and its driving space consists of the squares adjacent to the device.
  Once per day, the driver of a _planar carriage_ can attempt to transport the carriage and its occupants to a plane of her choosing other than the plane that the carriage is currently on. For the driver to do so, the vehicle must be moving at its maximum speed. While the carriage is moving at maximum speed, the driver can attempt a DC 20 Spellcraft or Use Magic Device check to open a gate in front of the _planar carriage_ to the chosen plane, as per the _gate_ spell, and drive the carriage into the gate. If the driver designates a specific arrival point on the target plane, the carriage arrives at that exact location; otherwise, the carriage appears in a random location on the plane appropriate for the carriage's size.
  When the carriage arrives on another plane, it grants its occupants the benefits of _planar adaptation_ for that plane as long as the occupants remain within the carriage; the carriage itself also gains those benefits. A _planar carriage_ can grant the benefits of _planar adaptation_ for only one plane at a time, so when the carriage moves to a different plane, the benefits from _planar adaptation_ change accordingly. Occupants who are native to the plane the _planar carriage_ is on do not gain any benefits from _planar adaptation_."

### Description

_[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Planar|Planar]]_ carriages are large metal-and-wood vehicles painted or styled to reflect the appearance of a certain plane. When not being used to travel to another plane, a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Planar Carriage|planar carriage]]_ functions as a heavy wagon, except for the following changes: instead of muscle propulsion, a _planar carriage_ has built-in magic propulsion that requires a driver to use Spellcraft or Use Magic Device for driving checks. A _planar carriage_ has a maximum speed of 90 feet and an acceleration of 30 feet. Its driving device is a magic item (a 5-foot magical sphere) that occupies the forwardmost square, and its driving space consists of the squares adjacent to the device.

Once per day, the driver of a _planar carriage_ can attempt to transport the carriage and its occupants to a plane of her choosing other than the plane that the carriage is currently on. For the driver to do so, the vehicle must be moving at its maximum speed. While the carriage is moving at maximum speed, the driver can attempt a DC 20 Spellcraft or Use Magic Device check to open a _[[spells/Gate|gate]]_ in front of the _planar carriage_ to the chosen plane, as per the _gate_ spell, and drive the carriage into the _gate_. If the driver designates a specific arrival point on the target plane, the carriage arrives at that exact location; otherwise, the carriage appears in a random location on the plane appropriate for the carriage's size.

When the carriage arrives on another plane, it grants its occupants the benefits of _[[spells/Planar Adaptation|planar adaptation]]_ for that plane as long as the occupants remain within the carriage; the carriage itself also gains those benefits. A _planar carriage_ can grant the benefits of _planar adaptation_ for only one plane at a time, so when the carriage moves to a different plane, the benefits from _planar adaptation_ change accordingly. Occupants who are native to the plane the _planar carriage_ is on do not gain any benefits from _planar adaptation_.
