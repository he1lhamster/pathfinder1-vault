Description: |
  "This traditional Osirian crown—known as a khepresh, or "war crown"—made of hardened blue leather and adorned with discs of blue-tinted electrum and a rearing, hooded cobra of gold, was crafted specifically for the Sky Pharaoh Hakotep I. The _khepresh of refuge_ grants its wearer a +3 deflection bonus to AC and fire resistance 10. In addition, the crown has 3 charges per day. When struck by a critical hit or sneak attack, the wearer can spend 1 charge as an immediate action to negate the critical hit or sneak attack (as the _fortification_ armor special ability, but without requiring a roll). The damage is instead rolled normally. Alternatively, the wearer can spend 1 charge as an immediate action to reroll a failed saving throw. He must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse."
