Description: |
  "This massive, metal-bound tome is filled with 20 thin pages of beaten copper, each indented with arcane sigils and Thassilonian runes. These runes seem to shimmer and twist and writhe when read, and the phrases and words they spell out are utter nonsense. By studying a page with a successful DC 20 Linguistics check, a person can make sense of the runes and as a full-round action can cause the runes on that page to swim together into a single shape that immediately leaps off the page to serve the user in one of three ways. The rune can manifest as a living rune (see page 88) that serves the user for 15 rounds, as if it had been summoned via a _summon monster_ spell. The rune can infest and deactivate any symbol, _glyph of warding_, or other trap made of magical writing with a +25 Disable Device check. The rune can also be made to float around the user's head for 10 rounds, during which time it can be used as an additional material component when casting a spell that creates magical writing. Doing so causes the spell to be cast at +1 caster level. Once a rune is activated, the page in the _tome of living runes_ on which the rune was written goes blank. Only one rune can be active at any one time."

### Description

This massive, metal-bound tome is filled with 20 thin pages of beaten copper, each indented with arcane sigils and Thassilonian runes. These runes seem to shimmer and twist and writhe when read, and the phrases and words they spell out are utter nonsense. By studying a page with a successful DC 20 Linguistics check, a person can make sense of the runes and as a full-round action can cause the runes on that page to swim together into a single shape that immediately leaps off the page to serve the user in one of three ways. The rune can manifest as a _[[monsters/Living Rune|living rune]]_ (see page 88) that serves the user for 15 rounds, as if it had been summoned via a _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ monster spell. The rune can infest and deactivate any symbol, _[[spells/Glyph Of Warding|glyph of warding]]_, or other trap made of magical writing with a +25 Disable Device check. The rune can also be made to float around the user's head for 10 rounds, during which time it can be used as an additional material component when casting a spell that creates magical writing. Doing so causes the spell to be cast at +1 caster level. Once a rune is activated, the page in the _[[items/Wondrous Item/Tome of Living Runes|tome of living runes]]_ on which the rune was written goes blank. Only one rune can be active at any one time.
