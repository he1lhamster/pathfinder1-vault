Description: |
  "This rough-spun green cloak is trimmed in wolf fur and fastened with a silver clasp. With the cloak drawn over his shoulders and the hood pulled up, the wearer becomes one with his surroundings, gaining a +5 bonus on Stealth checks and on Survival skill checks made to follow tracks. The cloak also renders the wearer immune to the scent ability.
  If the wearer expends one use of mythic power, the cloak turns him invisible for 1 hour, as _greater invisibility_. If the wearer makes an attack, the effects last for 1 minute after the attack, then end. A character made invisible by this cloak can't be detected with _detect magic_ or other spells or effects that detect magical auras. The _greater invisibility_ can't be penetrated, revealed, or dispelled by spells of 2nd level or lower (such as _see invisibility_ or _glitterdust_), though _true seeing_ and _dust of appearance_ can reveal the wearer's presence."
