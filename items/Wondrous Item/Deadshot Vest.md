Description: |
  "This rough vest of black snakeskin is decorated with a fringe of rawhide tassels, each knotted around a bit of bone or a small animal skull. A gunslinger with the deadeye deed reduces the grit point cost to use that deed by 1 (minimum 1 grit).
  In addition, once per day when the wearer reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm she can use _death knell_ (Will DC 13 negates) against that target as a swift action. She does not have to touch the target to activate this ability, but her range increment penalty for shooting the target also applies to the saving throw DC of the _death knell_ (for example, if the range increment penalty is –2, the DC is 11)."
