Description: |
  "This stone tablet bears a carving in the shape of a twig with five branches. There are only a limited number of _Elder Signs_ in existence, so each time one of these artifacts is destroyed, the universe loses one of the few things that can reliably keep cosmic horrors at bay—and inevitable doom draws closer.
  A creature holding an _Elder Sign_ can cast _banishment_, _forbiddance_, and _greater dispel magic_ at will by reciting occult mantras, though all three effects work only against creatures and magic related to the Elder Mythos, including any of the following creatures (and other cosmic horror-related creatures, at the GM's discretion): bhole, colour out of space, deep one, deep one elder, denizen of Leng, elder thing, flying polyp, gug, hound of Tindalos, Leng ghoul, Leng spider, mi-go, nightgaunt, ratling, shantak, shoggoth, spawn of Yog-Sothoth, star-spawn of Cthulhu, voonith, wendigo, and yithian. Casting _forbiddance_ this way doesn't require a costly material component, but if the same _Elder Sign_ is used to cast _forbiddance_ again, the artifact's connection to a previous location warded by the spell is severed, ending the first spell's effects immediately. Casting _banishment_ on one of the listed creatures works even if the creature isn't extraplanar; in that case, it sends the creature to the place on the Material Plane from which it originated.
  An _Elder Sign_ can also banish a Great Old One (no save), but doing so causes the artifact to be consumed in a bright flame."
Destruction: |
  "_Elder Signs_ are immune to damage, and the only certain way to destroy one of these artifacts is to banish a Great Old One with it."

### Description

This stone tablet bears a carving in the shape of a twig with five branches. There are only a limited number of Elder Signs in existence, so each time one of these artifacts is destroyed, the universe loses one of the few things that can reliably keep cosmic horrors at bay—and inevitable _[[spells/Doom|doom]]_ draws closer.

A creature holding an _[[items/Wondrous Item/Elder Sign|Elder Sign]]_ can cast _[[spells/Banishment|banishment]]_, _[[spells/Forbiddance|forbiddance]]_, and greater _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ at will by reciting occult mantras, though all three effects work only against creatures and magic related to the Elder Mythos, including any of the following creatures (and other cosmic horror-related creatures, at the GM's discretion): _[[monsters/Bhole|bhole]]_, _[[monsters/Colour Out of Space|colour out of space]]_, _[[monsters/Deep One|deep one]]_, _deep one_ elder, _[[monsters/Denizen of Leng|denizen of Leng]]_, _[[monsters/Elder Thing|elder thing]]_, _[[monsters/Flying Polyp|flying polyp]]_, _[[monsters/Gug|gug]]_, _[[monsters/Hound of Tindalos|hound of Tindalos]]_, Leng _[[monsters/Ghoul|ghoul]]_, _[[monsters/Leng Spider|Leng spider]]_, _[[monsters/Mi-go|mi-go]]_, _[[monsters/Nightgaunt|nightgaunt]]_, _[[monsters/Ratling|ratling]]_, _[[monsters/Shantak|shantak]]_, _[[monsters/Shoggoth|shoggoth]]_, _[[monsters/Spawn of Yog-Sothoth|spawn of Yog-Sothoth]]_, _[[monsters/Star-Spawn of Cthulhu|star-spawn of Cthulhu]]_, _[[monsters/Voonith|voonith]]_, _[[monsters/Wendigo|wendigo]]_, and _[[monsters/Yithian|yithian]]_. Casting _forbiddance_ this way doesn't require a costly material component, but if the same _Elder Sign_ is used to cast _forbiddance_ again, the artifact's connection to a previous location warded by the spell is severed, ending the first spell's effects immediately. Casting _banishment_ on one of the listed creatures works even if the creature isn't extraplanar; in that case, it sends the creature to the place on the Material Plane from which it originated.

An _Elder Sign_ can also banish a Great Old One (no save), but doing so causes the artifact to be consumed in a bright flame.

### _[[spells/Destruction|Destruction]]_

Elder Signs are immune to damage, and the only certain way to destroy one of these artifacts is to banish a Great Old One with it.
