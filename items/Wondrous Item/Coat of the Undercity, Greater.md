Title: "Coat of the Undercity, Greater"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "37500 gp"
Weight: "5 lbs."
Slot: "Chest"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "This coat functions much like the _coat of the undercity_, except the wearer can transform into a venomroach (_Bestiary 2 58_) as if using vermin shape II.
  Alternatively, the wearer can take the form of a giant cockroach swarm. This swarm of Tiny vermin has a number of hit points equal to the wearer, uses the wearer's mental ability scores, skills, and saving throws, and gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects instead of being immune to them. The swarm otherwise has the same movement, Armor Class, swarm traits, swarm damage, distraction and disease abilities as a typical rat swarm (including the abilities having a DC of 12). While in swarm form, the wearer can't use any of her activated abilities (extraordinary, supernatural, spell-like, or otherwise), cast spells, or use items, although she can end the effect as a standard action.
  Either of these transformations can occur only in an urban environment. The wearer can remain transformed for up to 9 minutes per day. This duration doesn't need to be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments."
