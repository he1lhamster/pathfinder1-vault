Title: "Familiar Bubble"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "2500 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "3"
Aura: "faint conjuration"
Description: |
  "A _familiar bubble_ looks like nothing more than a pair of reinforced leather straps designed to fit over the shoulders— until it is worn. Once the straps are donned, a bubble of force forms on the wearer's back, large enough to hold a Tiny or smaller creature and 1 pound of items (usually food for the creature). The bubble is transparent and continuously generates fresh, breathable air within. While the bubble keeps air in and water out, it is permeable to other objects. Spells and weapons can target the creature in the _familiar bubble_ normally.
  As a standard action, the _familiar bubble's_ user can designate a specific creature within 30 feet that can pass freely in and out of the bubble. All other living creatures find the bubble impenetrable. This selection remains until the wearer chooses a different creature or removes the _familiar bubble_ (which causes the bubble to disappear). Normally, the user selects a creature in order to get it into the bubble and then selects himself so he can retrieve the creature, if needed."
