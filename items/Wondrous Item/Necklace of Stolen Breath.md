Description: |
  "This necklace is a string of intricately carved bones that hold fragments of drowned souls. The wearer can mimic the voice of anyone whose spirit is stored in the necklace as if using _sound mimicry_. Additionally, the wearer can destroy a bone as a standard action to summon a drowned shade, which has the stats of a water elemental with the following changes. A drowned shade gains undead immunities and is treated as undead, and it projects a 20-foot-radius drowning aura, which imposes a –5 penalty on Swim checks to creatures without the aquatic or water subtype and negates magical means of breathing underwater. Each round a creature holds its breath within the aura counts as 2 rounds for the purpose of drowning.
  Once per day, if the wearer falls below 0 hit points, she can destroy a bone to heal herself (this is not an action).
  A minor soul bone summons a Small water elemental drowned shade or heals 1d8+11 hit points; a lesser soul bone summons a Medium water elemental drowned shade or heals 3d8+11 hit points; a standard soul bone summons a Large water elemental drowned shade or heals 5d8+11 hit points; and a greater soul bone summons a Huge water elemental drowned shade or heals 7d8+11 hit points.
  The necklace's listed price does not include the price of bones. The wearer can add a new soul bone to the necklace by ritually drowning a sentient creature and paying the additional cost. The requirements are as follows minor (300 gp, 2-HD sacrifice), lesser (1,400 gp, 4-HD sacrifice), standard (2,250 gp, 8-HD sacrifice), and greater (3,300 gp, 10-HD sacrifice)."
