Title: "Black Heart"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "18800 gp"
Weight: "0.5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "faint necromancy"
Description: |
  "This withered, black heart is disturbingly cool to the touch. It must be attuned to an evil deity in a vile ritual that takes at least 1 hour and requires a living sentient creature as a sacrifice before the wielder can use its powers. Once attuned, it counts as an unholy symbol of that deity for all purposes (such as acting as a divine focus for spellcasting) and can't be attuned to another deity until at least 1 week has passed since its last use.
  By brandishing the _black heart_ as a standard action, the wielder can detect the presence of good creatures. If any good creatures are within 60 feet, the withered heart begins to slowly beat. The heart doesn't show the wielder who specifically is good, but it does beat faster the closer to a good creature it comes. The wielder can activate this ability once per day, and it lasts as long as she concentrates, to a maximum of 10 minutes.
  If the wielder brandishes the heart and concentrates, the wielder can squeeze the heart as a standard action, targeting a living creature within 60 feet. The target takes 3d8+5 points of damage and becomes sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 14 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the sickened effect. This is a negative energy effect, and evil creatures are immune to it."
