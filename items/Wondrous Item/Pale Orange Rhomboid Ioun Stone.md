  "This stone absorbs your soul as the _magic jar_ spell immediately prior to your death. You can't transfer your soul from the _ioun stone_ receptacle to another creature's body, and are, for all intents and purposes, dead. While your soul is in the _ioun stone_, you can sense any life forces within 120 feet as though you were placed in a _magic jar_. At any point within 12 hours of your soul's transfer into the _pale orange rhombus ioun stone_, you can return to your body as long as it is within 120 feet of the _ioun stone_. Upon returning to your body, you are unconscious and dying with a number of negative hit points equal to your Constitution score minus 1. If you fail to stabilize and aren't healed after 1 turn, you die and your soul is not absorbed by the _ioun stone_. Your soul can be absorbed into a _pale orange rhombus ioun stone_ only once per 24-hour period.
  **Resonance:** A soul held within the stone can remain there indefinitely as long as the _wayfinder_ remains on the soul's original body. If the _wayfinder_ is removed from the body, the _ioun stone's_ resonant power is suppressed until the _wayfinder _is replaced."
