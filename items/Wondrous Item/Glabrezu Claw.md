Title: "Glabrezu Claw"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "–"
Weight: "5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "20"
Aura: "strong universal"
Description: |
  "This gruesome artifact looks like the mummified, hollowed-out arm of a glabrezu. This graft contains an imprisoned parasitic demon that can be satiated only by mythic power. To use the artifact, the user must place his own naked arm into the hollow graft, which then permanently bonds itself to his flesh and muscle. If placed upon the arm of a nonmythic character, the graft instead devours the limb, dealing 5d6 points of damage and amputating the arm.
  Once attached, the _glabrezu claw_ surrounds its wearer with a field of force. This provides a deflection bonus to AC equal to the wearer's mythic tier. The wearer also gains immunity to electricity and poison. In addition, the wearer can feed the _glabrezu claw_ some of his mythic power in order to activate spell-like abilities. All these spell-like abilities have a caster level equivalent to the graft wearer's total class levels plus his mythic tier.
  The graft wearer can expend one use of mythic power to gain telepathy with a range of 100 feet for 2 hours (_Bestiary_ 300) or cast any of the following spells: _chaos hammer_, _confusion_, _dispel magic_, _mirror image_, _reverse gravity_, or _true seeing_.
  By expending two uses, he can cast _greater teleport_ (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), _veil_ (self only), or _unholy blight_.
  By expending three uses, he can cast _power word stun_ or summon (level 4, either 1 glabrezu 30% or 1d2 vrocks 70%; _Bestiary_ 300)."
Destruction: |
  "A _glabrezu claw_ crumbles to dust and the demon within is destroyed if placed upon arm of a formerly evil high priest who has atoned for his past and converted to worship a good deity."
