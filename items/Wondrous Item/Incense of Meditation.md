Price: "4900 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate enchantment"
Description: |
  "This incense comes in many shapes and colors, but is otherwise indistinguishable from nonmagical incense until lit. When it is burned, the special fragrance and pearly hued smoke of this special incense are recognizable by anyone making a DC 15 Spellcraft check.
  When a divine spellcaster lights a block of _incense of meditation_ and then spends 8 hours praying and meditating nearby, the incense enables him to prepare all his spells as though affected by the Maximize Spell feat. However, all the spells prepared in this way are at their normal level, not at three levels higher (as with the regular metamagic feat).
  Each block of incense burns for 8 hours, and the effects persist for 24 hours. The incense may be burned in a _censer of controlling air elements_ to summon a more powerful elemental; this renders it useless for maximizing spellcasting."

### Description

This _[[items/Mundane/Incense|incense]]_ comes in many shapes and colors, but is otherwise indistinguishable from nonmagical _incense_ until lit. When it is burned, the special fragrance and pearly hued smoke of this special _incense_ are recognizable by anyone making a DC 15 Spellcraft check.
