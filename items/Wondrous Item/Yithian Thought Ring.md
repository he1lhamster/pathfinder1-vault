Slot: "Head"
Caster level: "15"
Aura: "strong divination"
Description: |
  "Each _yithian thought ring_ is attuned to a particular type or category of creature, and this decision is made at the item's creation. This can go beyond simple creature types—a _yithian thought ring_ can be made to function for very specific conditions. For example, the one in this adventure is keyed into minds that have been exposed to Xhamen-Dor, which is how Kaklatath was able to reach out across great distances to the PCs. A yithian wearing one of these devices can also use its mind swap and amnesia abilities at the same range.
  Once a _yithian thought ring_ has been created with a particular parameter, it can be attuned again, but this process requires partially dismantling the original device and rebuilding it. This process takes 1d4 days and costs an additional 5,000 gp in materials.
  A _yithian thought ring_ can be used only by yithians."
Crafting cost: "17500 gp"
