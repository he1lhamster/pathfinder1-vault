Price: "1500 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "11"
Aura: "moderate necromancy"
Description: |
  "Crafted from collected ectoplasm and wax, _candles of spirit protection_ ward off creatures from the spirit world. To function, a _candle of spirit protection_ must be placed in the desired area. When it's lit, fine lines of smoke coil out, creating a circular line of smoke in a 10-foot radius around the candle. This area is protected against intrusion by astrally projected creatures, ethereal creatures, haunts, incorporeal creatures, mediums channeling a spirit, and phantoms, and at the GM's discretion can affect other spirits or creatures made of ectoplasm. Such creatures can't enter the area of effect, and act as though they were affected by an _antilife shell_ that specifically targets them and no other creatures.
  The candle can't be moved once it is lit; attempting to do so ends the effect. Otherwise, a lit _candle of spirit protection_ burns for 1 hour. Either way, the candle is expended after one use."
