Price: "9000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate divination"
Description: |
  "This small flag sports a banner that is 2 inches wide by 3 inches tall and has a thin wooden dowel that serves as the flag post. When a creature plants the flag in the ground and speaks the command word, the flag expands into a military tent of stout canvas with the flag flapping from the centermost tent pole. The tent fills a space that is 15 feet by 30 feet. The entrance of the tent consists of a vestibule with an outer and inner flap for keeping light from spilling out. Inside, the _commander's tent_ contains a central table and several chairs and cushions. Several lanterns hang from pegs around the perimeter of the interior, providing sufficient light for reading letters, maps, and so forth. Despite this illumination, the exterior of the tent does not glow so long as only one tent flap at the vestibule (inner or outer) is open at any given time. The center table features a blank map. Once per week, any creature inside the tent can utter a second command word to transform the map into a model of the nearby area, as _sand table_ (see page 164).
  While the _commander's tent_ is in tent form, the user can utter a third command word while holding a new flag to replace the flag atop the tent with one of his own choosing. The two pennants swap places. A fourth command word causes the tent to break down, returning to its miniature flag form."
