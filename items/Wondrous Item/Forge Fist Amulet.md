Description: |
  "This fist-shaped stone amulet glows with a fiery light. On command, this amulet causes the wearer's fists to transform into red-hot flaming adamantine. The wearer is protected from the searing heat and can make savage blows with his hands. Unarmed strikes and natural attacks the wearer make with his hands gain the _flaming_ weapon special ability and are treated as adamantine for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction (but not hardness). The wearer's hands become rigid while using this amulet and cannot be use to hold or manipulate objects (unless that manipulation could be accomplished with a club and is not damaged by fire). The transformation can be ended as a swift action."
