Description: |
  "These spectacles fit firmly over eyes and are held in place by two crystalline stems. The lenses are initially clear and don't hinder the wearer's vision. When the wearer is targeted with an illusion spell or spell-like ability of the pattern subschool (such as _color spray_), the spectacles absorb the magic and darken, protecting the wearer from the pattern effect. Once the spectacles absorb a spell and become opaque, the wearer becomes blinded until the spectacles are removed (a swift action). _Patternward spectacles_ protect against spells or spell-like abilities of only 3rd level or lower; higher-level effects affect the wearer as normal. Once the spectacles absorb an effect, they lose their magic."
