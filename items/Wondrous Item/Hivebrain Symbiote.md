  "This red maggot constantly writhes and distends, snapping a small pair of pincers. A combination of hellwasp and worm, the _hivebrain symbiote_ grants an echo of a hive mind when attached to an intelligent creature. When placed on the back of a host's neck as a standard action, the _hivebrain symbiote_ attaches painlessly and immediately boosts the host's mental faculties. While having a _hivebrain symbiote_ attached, as an immediate action the host can reroll a concentration check or an Intelligence-based check. The host must take the second roll, even if it is worse. An attached _hivebrain symbiote_ continues to function for a number of hours equal to the host's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 hour) before falling off and dying. A _hivebrain symbiote_ dies immediately if removed before this time elapses."
