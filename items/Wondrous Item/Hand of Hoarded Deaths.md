  "The wearer of this single, black silk glove can use _death knell_ on command. The target of _death knell_ dies if it fails a DC 13 Fortitude save as normal, but the glove's wearer does not immediately benefit from the death; instead the siphoned life energy is stored inside the glove. The glove indefinitely holds a reservoir of up to five deaths. The wearer can tap into these deaths anytime thereafter by touching herself with the glove as a swift action, granting her _death knell's_ benefits with a duration of 10 minutes. She can spend more than one death at a time, if she wishes. Temporary hit points from multiple deaths stack, but the bonuses to caster level and Strength do not. If multiple deaths are spent at the same time, add their durations together."
