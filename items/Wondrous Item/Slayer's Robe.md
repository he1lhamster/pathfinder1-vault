  "This ragged, brown robe could be mistaken for a monk's cassock, but the devotees who wear it are dedicated only to the art of killing. This robe grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks and Sleight of Hand checks to conceal a weapon, and a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. If worn by a slayer, the resistance bonus on saving throws increases to match the slayer's studied target bonus when he is facing a studied target.
  On command, the robe's wearer is able to turn into a brown mist (as the _gaseous form_ spell) for up to 5 minutes per day.
