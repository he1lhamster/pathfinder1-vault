Description: |
  "This thin sheet of opaque black stone is polished to a reflective sheen, but the center of the material drinks all light, becoming a pool of total darkness.
  A _nightglass_ can be used three times per day to summon various creatures from the Shadow Plane. Any effort to summon a creature requires a successful DC 15 Will save. On a failed save, the user takes 1d4 points of Strength damage and must attempt another save on his next turn. On a successful save, a shadow is summoned. This acts as _summon monster IV_, except it can be used only to summon a single shadow, and the shadow remains for 1 hour or until destroyed. If the user took Strength damage during the summoning effort, the shadow remains for 1 additional hour per point of Strength lost. Any Strength damage that is restored no longer adds to the duration of the summoned shadow.
  If a user's Strength is reduced to 0 by the _nightglass_ while attempting to summon a shadow, the user is trapped within the _nightglass_ as if by a _trap the soul_ spell, except breaking the _nightglass_ does not free the trapped soul (which can be released only through a _miracle_, a _wish_, or similar powerful magic). Additionally, a creature from the Plane of Shadow emerges from the _nightglass_. This creature takes the form of the user drained to 0 Strength. It uses the same stat block as the trapped soul, but also has the shadow creature template (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4_ 238). The shadow creature has the memories, class levels, and abilities of the user it replaces, but is always of neutral evil alignment. A successful DC 20 Sense Motive check allows anyone familiar with the original character to realize the shadow creature is not actually the person it resembles. The shadow creature is not bound or controlled by the _nightglass_ and has its own dark agenda, but may work with groups able to provide it with security and aid. Should the original user somehow manage to escape the _nightglass_, the shadow creature replacement is immediately sent back to the Plane of Shadow.
  A _nightglass_ can also be used once per day to communicate with creatures with the evil subtype on other planes of existence. To use a _nightglass_ in this way, the user must know the true name of the creature she is trying to contact. Communication works two ways, and the mirrored surface of the _nightglass_ hazily shows the creature being contacted."

### Description

This thin sheet of opaque black stone is polished to a reflective sheen, but the center of the material drinks all light, becoming a pool of total _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_.

A _[[items/Wondrous Item/Nightglass|nightglass]]_ can be used three times per day to _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ various creatures from the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|Shadow]]_ Plane. Any effort to _summon_ a creature requires a successful DC 15 Will save. On a failed save, the user takes 1d4 points of Strength damage and must attempt another save on his next turn. On a successful save, a _shadow_ is summoned. This acts as _[[spells/Summon Monster IV|summon monster IV]]_, except it can be used only to _summon_ a single _shadow_, and the _shadow_ remains for 1 hour or until destroyed. If the user took Strength damage during the summoning effort, the _shadow_ remains for 1 additional hour per point of Strength lost. Any Strength damage that is restored no longer adds to the duration of the summoned _shadow_.

If a user's Strength is reduced to 0 by the _nightglass_ while attempting to _summon_ a _shadow_, the user is trapped within the _nightglass_ as if by a _[[spells/Trap the Soul|trap the soul]]_ spell, except _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Breaking|breaking]]_ the _nightglass_ does not free the trapped soul (which can be released only through a _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_, a _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_, or similar powerful magic). Additionally, a creature from the Plane of _Shadow_ emerges from the _nightglass_. This creature takes the form of the user drained to 0 Strength. It uses the same stat block as the trapped soul, but also has the _shadow_ creature template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 238). The _shadow_ creature has the memories, class levels, and abilities of the user it replaces, but is always of neutral evil alignment. A successful DC 20 Sense Motive check allows anyone familiar with the original character to realize the _shadow_ creature is not actually the person it resembles. The _shadow_ creature is not bound or controlled by the _nightglass_ and has its own dark agenda, but may work with groups able to provide it with security and aid. Should the original user somehow manage to escape the _nightglass_, the _shadow_ creature replacement is immediately sent back to the Plane of _Shadow_.

A _nightglass_ can also be used once per day to communicate with creatures with the evil subtype on other planes of existence. To use a _nightglass_ in this way, the user must know the _[[feats/True Name|true name]]_ of the creature she is trying to contact. Communication works two ways, and the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Mirrored|mirrored]]_ surface of the _nightglass_ hazily shows the creature being contacted.
