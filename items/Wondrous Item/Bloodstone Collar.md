Description: |
  "This leather collar is studded with red and black heliotropes and fastened with an iron clasp. It functions only when worn by a spellcaster's familiar or spirit animal. If a familiar wearing a _bloodstone collar_ is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, the familiar immediately stabilizes at –1 hit points, and any remaining damage is dealt to the familiar's master. The master can refuse this damage, but the feedback of doing so immediately slays the familiar. Each time a _bloodstone collar_ activates, one of its heliotrope studs cracks; once a third stud cracks, the collar becomes a ordinary nonmagical collar. A _bloodstone collar_ is not triggered by death effects or other damaging effects that do not deal hit point damage."
