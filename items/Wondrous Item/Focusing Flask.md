Price: "700 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "This round, rainbow-hued glass flask allows up to three alchemical splash weapons of the same type to be poured into it, concentrating them such that they never increase its weight noticeably. If multiple types of alchemical items are poured in, all the contents are ruined. The flask can be thrown as a normal splash weapon, and when it breaks, it releases all of the contained splash weapons in the same space, and the _focusing flask_ is destroyed. If the items held within the flask normally allow a saving throw to reduce or negate the effects, the target of a _focusing flask_ needs to succeed at only a single saving throw, regardless of the number of items held within the _focusing flask_. The DC of the saving throw increases by 2 if the flask contains two alchemical items, or by 4 if it contains three items."
