Aura: "strong illusion"
Description: |
  "Once each year, a _Cradle of Night_ can infuse a single living creature that handles it with a manifestation of the shadowbound corruption. If the creature wishes to reject the manifestation, it can do so by succeeding at a DC 25 Will save, but if the creature fails this saving throw, it gains the manifestation's stain without its gift. A creature with a manifestation of the shadowbound corruption that carries a _Cradle of Night_ on its person ceases aging, gains a +4 profane bonus to Strength and Constitution, and gains fast healing equal to its total Hit Dice. These effects are suppressed whenever the creature is in bright light, but time spent not aging does not catch up to the bearer at such times."
Destruction: |
  "A _Cradle of Night_ that is exposed to direct sunlight for 8 consecutive hours becomes relatively fragile and can be destroyed by damage, but spending at least a minute in shadow or darkness removes this fragility. While fragile, a _Cradle of Night_ has hardness 15 and 30 hp. If the artifact is destroyed, each creature that has willingly accepted a manifestation from the _Cradle of Night_ must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or be immediately destroyed, as if by a sphere of annihilation. Creatures that did not willingly gain the _Cradle of Night's_ manifestations instead immediately lose the shadowbound corruption (and all manifestations it granted), but suffer no other ill effect."

### Description

Once each year, a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Cradle of Night|Cradle of Night]]_ can infuse a single living creature that handles it with a manifestation of the shadowbound corruption. If the creature wishes to reject the manifestation, it can do so by succeeding at a DC 25 Will save, but if the creature fails this saving throw, it gains the manifestation's stain without its gift. A creature with a manifestation of the shadowbound corruption that carries a _Cradle of Night_ on its person ceases aging, gains a +4 profane bonus to Strength and Constitution, and gains _[[universal monster rules/Fast Healing|fast healing]]_ equal to its total Hit Dice. These effects are suppressed whenever the creature is in bright light, but time spent not aging does not catch up to the bearer at such times.

### _[[spells/Destruction|Destruction]]_

A _Cradle of Night_ that is exposed to direct sunlight for 8 consecutive hours becomes relatively fragile and can be destroyed by damage, but spending at least a minute in _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|shadow]]_ or _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_ removes this fragility. While fragile, a _Cradle of Night_ has hardness 15 and 30 hp. If the artifact is destroyed, each creature that has willingly accepted a manifestation from the _Cradle of Night_ must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or be immediately destroyed, as if by a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Sphere of Annihilation|sphere of annihilation]]_. Creatures that did not willingly gain the _Cradle of Night_'s manifestations instead immediately lose the shadowbound corruption (and all manifestations it granted), but suffer no other ill effect.
