  "These wire spectacles are fitted with several groundcrystal filters on hinged arms, any combination of which can be moved in front of or away from the lenses as a standard action (one, two, or all three lenses may be positioned at the same time with one action). Each filter grants a specific sense to the wearer when it is placed before one of the lenses. Each set of filters can be used for 10 minutes in 1-minute increments before losing its magical properties. The three sets of lenses are as follows.
  _Green Lenses_: Grant the wearer the benefits of _detect magic_. The wearer doesn't need to concentrate to gain the benefits of the spell as long as a source of magic remains in her line of sight for the appropriate number of rounds.
  _Pink Lenses_: Grant the wearer the benefits of _see invisibility_.
  _Purple Lenses_: Grant the wearer darkvision out to a distance of 60 feet. If the wearer already has darkvision, the range of her darkvision increases by 60 feet while she uses these filters."
