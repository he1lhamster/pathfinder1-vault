Description: |
  "_Devil's spit_ is a more potent form of unholy water, and acts in most ways like a vial of that substance. However, a direct hit by a flask of _devil's spit_ deals 4d4 points of damage to good outsiders and lawful good creatures, 6d4 points of damage to lawful good outsiders, and 2d4 points of damage to all other good-aligned creatures. All creatures within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits take 2 points of damage if they are good outsiders or lawful good creatures, 3 points of damage if they are lawful good outsiders, and 1 point of damage if they are chaotic good or neutral good.
  _Devil's spit_ can also be used to charge a _rod of burning blood_ (see below). A single vial of _devil's spit_ provides 5 charges to that item. Charging a _rod of burning blood_ with devil's spit is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity."
