Price: "6900 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "13"
Aura: "strong necromancy"
Description: |
  "This figurine stands several inches tall and is carved of black stone with gold highlights, resembling a man with the head of a jackal. With a successful DC 20 Knowledge (religion) check, a character identifies the figure as Anubis, the Ancient Osirian god of burial, funeral rites, mummification, and a protector of the dead and their tombs. Once per week, an _effigy of Anubis_ enables its possessor to use _speak with dead_ and ask up to six questions. The effigy must be placed within the rib cage of a corpse, and the corpse's answers come through the effigy— the jackal's mouth moves with the words. The corpse must still be mostly intact and have a mouth for the spell to work.
  In addition, an _effigy of Anubis_ can be used to bring a dead creature back to life, though Anubis, as god of the dead, is willing to grant only a temporary reprieve from oblivion. Breaking the figurine reveals a hollow interior filled with diamond dust. If this diamond dust is sprinkled on a corpse that has been dead for less than 48 hours, the creature comes back to life as with _temporary resurrection_ (_Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic_ 243). This effect lasts for 24 hours, at which point the creature dies again. Once used in this way, an _effigy of Anubis_ loses all of its magic and is destroyed."
