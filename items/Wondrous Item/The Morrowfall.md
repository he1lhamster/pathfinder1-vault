Description: |
  "The _Morrowfall_ is one-half of the _Aohl_, an artifact gifted to the ancient Jaytirian Society following a sacred truce between their two feuding gods of millennia past. The _Morrowfall_ is the remaining manifestation of the power of Easivra, a potent sun god now all but forgotten (it's a DC 30 Knowledge [religion] check to learn Easivra's name, but any good-aligned creature that touches the _Morrowfall_ immediately knows the name and how to use the artifact's powers). The _Morrowfall_ constantly emits daylight, as per the spell. In addition, by presenting it strongly and uttering Easivra's name (a standard action), the _Morrowfall_ can be used to cast the following spells.
  At Will — _detect undead_, _disrupt undead_, _daze monster_ (DC 13)
  3/day — _blindness_ (DC 13), _daylight_, _searing light_
  1/day — _sunbeam_ (DC 20), _sunburst_ (DC 22)"
Destruction: |
  "When the _Morrowfall_ is joined with its counterpart, the _Totemrix_, its powers (as well as those of the _Totemrix_) are suppressed. In this state, both it and the _Totemrix_ can be destroyed by anything capable of destroying a magic metal object of its size."
