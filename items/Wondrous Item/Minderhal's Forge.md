Description: |
  "_Minderhal's Forge_ appears to be a giant stone blacksmithing forge and huge iron anvil set atop a basalt platform that rises from a pit of slag. First and foremost, _Minderhal's Forge_ functions as an _altar of Minderhal_ (see page 246 of _Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods_ for rules on altars). Any creature (not just a worshiper of Minderhal) can pray at the altar, though accepting the altar's blessing is both an evil and lawful act. Praying at the altar grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft and Sense Motive checks, or one of the following weapon special abilities (creature's choice) to one magic weapon carried or wielded by the creature: _axiomatic_ or _unholy_. This effect is suppressed if the weapon leaves the creature's grasp, but resumes if the weapon is returned to the creature.
  _Minderhal's Forge_ is also a fully working forge. Any creature using the forge can create magic weapons, armor, or shields as if it possessed the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat. If the creature already has that feat, the forge grants a +5 circumstance bonus on the Craft check needed to create a magic weapon, armor, or shields. Crafting any sort of item, whether magical or otherwise, using _Minderhal's Forge_ takes half the normal amount of time.
  In addition, _Minderhal's Forge_ has 10 charges, which renew at the beginning of each day. A creature using _Minderhal's Forge_ can expend the listed number of charges to activate one of the following spell-like abilities as a full-round action, which can affect targets within 10 feet of the forge.
  Lastly, _Minderhal's Forge_ can be used in conjunction with _Agrimmosh, the Hammer of Unmaking_ (_Pathfinder Adventure Path #91: Battle of Bloodmarch Hill_ 56) to resize armor and weapons. When a weapon, suit of armor, or shield is placed in _Minderhal's Forge_ and struck with _Agrimmosh_, the equipment permanently resizes to match the size of _Agrimmosh's_ wielder. This power is so strong that magic or even intelligent items are always affected; only artifacts receive a saving throw (Will DC 25 negates) to resist this effect."
Destruction: |
  "Quenching _Minderhal's Forge_ with the blood of the last worshiper of Minderhal causes the forge to crumble into rubble and be destroyed."
