Description: |
  "This ornate bronze compass aids the faithful in locating allies, or inquisitors in identifying cultists. When a holy symbol is touched to a _congregant's compass_ as a standard action, the needle spins lazily for the next 5 minutes. If a devoted member of the faith associated with that holy symbol (an outsider servant, a mortal cleric, or a mortal worshiper carrying a holy symbol) is within 60 feet of an activated _congregant's compass_, the needle spins rapidly for 3 rounds before pointing in the direction of the nearest worshiper. The needle continues to point to the nearest worshiper until the 5-minute duration expires, changing its direction if another worshiper moves closer to the compass. The needle returns to spinning lazily if all worshipers move out of range, although it reorients to the nearest worshiper after another 3 rounds of rapid spinning if one approaches within 60 feet. The _congregant's compass's_ detection is blocked by a sheet of lead, 1 inch of common metal, 1 foot of stone, or 3 feet of wood or dirt, and spells such as _misdirection_ and _nondetection_ can foil it. A _congregant's compass_ doesn't detect the creature holding it, even if she worships the appropriate faith. A _congregant's compass_ can be used three times per day."
