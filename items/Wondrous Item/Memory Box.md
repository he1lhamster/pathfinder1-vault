Description: |
  "This 3-inch cubic puzzle box is coated in dark lacquer and elegantly decorated with gold leaf, mother-of-pearl, and precious stones. Opening the box requires 1 minute and a successful DC 22 Intelligence check, which can be attempted only once per day. The box opens into a nondimensional space, like a _bag of holding_, that can contain up to 2 cubic feet or 20 pounds of material. Even when the box is filled, its weight remains negligible.
  A _memory box_ can store more than just material. Once per day, if the user speaks a command word when the box is open, she can recount one piece of knowledge she possesses to remove that knowledge from her mind, as _repress memory_, and store it in the box. If the user speaks a command word when the box is closed and then opens it within 1 minute, she can mentally review any of her memories that are stored in the box and permanently erase or instantly restore any she wishes. Memories stored in the box can't be restored by other means. Once she closes the box, the user retains the knowledge that the box contains stored memories, but no details regarding which. A creature that has one or more memories stored in the box gains a +12 circumstance bonus on the Intelligence check required to reopen it.
  The user can't review stored memories that belong to someone else. Memories that are erased from the box can be restored to their owner only by _break enchantment, psychic surgery, limited wish, miracle_, or _wish_. A _memory box_ can contain up to 12 memories at a time. Storing a new memory when the box is already at its full capacity causes the oldest memory to be erased, regardless of whose memory it is."
