Title: "Lintel Stone"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "26000 gp"
Weight: "12 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "11"
Aura: "moderate conjuration"
Description: |
  "This heavy granite brick has no effect until it is held at the top of a door, window, or similar portal and touched with a forked metal rod attuned to serve as the focus component for a _plane shift_ spell as a standard action. Once activated in this manner, the _lintel stone_ remains affixed to the portal, in defiance of gravity, and cannot be removed for 1 minute. During this time, creatures stepping through the opening must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be shunted to the plane to which the metal rod is attuned. All travelers appear in the same location, stepping out of another portal somewhere on the destination plane (which might be a constructed doorway or a natural arch, as befits the destination plane). Unlike with _plane shift_, the creature activating a lintel stone has no control over the arrival point on the destination plane, although the portal is usually in a similar area (such as an urban one, if activated in a city). One minute after activation, the _lintel stone_ disappears, reappearing among the possessions of the creature that activated it, regardless of the current location or plane of that creature. A _lintel stone_ can be activated once per day."
