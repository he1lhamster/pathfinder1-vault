  "Divination reveals this large humanoid skull to be that of a gorilla or giant, although it is actually an accursed _sasquatch skull_. The item seems to grant its bearer a +5 bonus on Stealth checks in wooded areas.If an individual takes possession of the _sasquatch skull_ for more than 24 hours, it quickly begins to stink. The smell is undetectable by the skull's bearer, but companions and creatures within 30 feet find the pungent smell extremely noticeable. The smell imposes a –2 penalty on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks made by the skull's owner. In addition, aggressive wild animals always target the skull's owner first during combat. The skull need not be on the owner's person for the curse to manifest, so long as ownership has not been transferred through sale, gift, or theft."
