Description: |
  "An _arcane battery_ is a fist-sized lead container—typically a sphere, pyramid, or cylinder—that stores magically treated saltwater. When affixed to the head of a magical staff with the attached lashings, an _arcane battery_ increases the maximum number of charges the staff can hold to 11 (instead of 10). An attached _arcane battery_ also allows the wielder of a staff to imbue a staff with up to two charges per day. In order to do so, the wielder must expend two prepared spells or spell slots that meet the prerequisites for recharging a staff.
  A staff may only have a single _arcane battery_ attached to it, and an _arcane battery_ must be adjoined to a staff for 24 hours before its powers are attuned to the staff. If an _arcane battery_ is removed from a staff by the staff's wielder, it must be reattached and remain so for 24 hours before it's attuned again."
