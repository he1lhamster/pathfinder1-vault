Title: "Explosion Pocket"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "3000 gp"
Weight: "0.5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "1"
Aura: "faint evocation"
Description: |
  "An _explosion pocket_ looks like a cloth pouch just large enough to contain a Small or Medium humanoid's hand. When placed against a shirt, vest, jacket, trousers, or similar piece of clothing, this ragged green patch attaches to the clothing, creating a loose pocket. The pocket functions as a normal pocket, but once per day the _pocket's_ wearer can, as a standard action by speaking a command word while his hand is in the _pocket_, cause the _pocket_ to create a single vial of alchemist's fire. If a vial of alchemist's fire is in the _explosion_ pocket when it is commanded to create a vial of alchemist's fire, the pocket instead supercharges the existing vial within so that it inflicts double the normal fire damage a vial of alchemist's fire would normally inflict. An _explosion pocket_ can be removed as a full-round action, allowing it to be placed on a different piece of clothing as the owner wishes. A vial of alchemist's fire created or supercharged by an _explosion pocket_ reverts to a vial of inert bitter-tasting water 1 minute after it is created or supercharged."
