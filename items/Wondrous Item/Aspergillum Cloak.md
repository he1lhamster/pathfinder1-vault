Description: |
  "This drab brown, hooded cloak acts as a _cloak of resistance +1_ but also quickly absorbs any liquids poured onto it, drying in moments. Three times per day, the wearer can pour a vial of holy water onto the interior lining of an _aspergillum cloak_, causing its outer surface to glisten and drip. The holy water cannot be recovered once absorbed. For 7 minutes, the garment is soaked in holy water, dealing 2d4 points of damage to any undead or evil outsider that strikes the wearer with an unarmed strike or a natural weapon. An _aspergillum cloak_ can also absorb unholy water instead, dealing damage to good outsiders instead. An _aspergillum cloak_ gains no special abilities from absorbing any other liquid."
