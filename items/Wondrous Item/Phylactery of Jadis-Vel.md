Description: |
  "This item is a receptacle for a lich's soul. It was broken into five pieces. Individually, each piece can do no more than whisper "Jadis-Vel," the name of the lich whose fragmented soul is trapped within. When the pieces of the phylactery are all gathered within 30 feet of each other, they collectively become an intelligent item with the memories and will of the lich whose soul it contains. The spirit retains only fractured memories of its former existence, but it gains an understanding of how to escape and reclaim those memories.
  The combined pieces teach their owner how to find the path to lichdom, a process that is unique to each soul. They have a +13 bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks for this purpose. A prospective lich can choose the _Phylactery of Jadis-Vel_ as her own phylactery, negating the gold cost of crafting a phylactery (though this does not bypass the other construction requirements for creating a phylactery). Once the prospective lich performs the necessary ritual to become a lich, the trickery of the phylactery comes to fruition: the new lich's spirit becomes trapped within the shards of this phylactery, and the soul of Jadis-Vel is released into the new lich's body. The freed lich is without a phylactery and must craft a new one, but is otherwise returned to the world intact, albeit in a different body."
