Description: |
  "This brass oil lamp has an etching of crossed khopeshes on each side and is thought to have once held a powerful malik. When the owner of this lamp rubs it as a full-round action and concentrates on a nonmagical fire within line of sight, he can gaze out of the flame as though he were standing in it. The targeted flame can be as small as a candle or as large as a forest fire, though for fires larger than 5 feet wide, the user must specify from which square within range he sees.
  While gazing out from a distant fire, the user can communicate with anyone who is near that fire simply by speaking—the user's voice emanates from the flame. The user cannot cast spells or make attacks through the flame, nor can he perform any actions other than viewing and speaking. If the fire is doused while the user is gazing through it, he must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become dazed for 1 round.
  A _lamp of fiery visions_ can be used for up to 5 minutes per day. This duration need not be consecutive, but it must spent in 1-minute increments."
