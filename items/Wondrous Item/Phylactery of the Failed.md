Description: |
  "Not every lich that attempts the transition to undeath succeeds. For most, this means an excruciating, spellblasted death; for a small fraction of others, this means a typically brief but painful existence as a failed lich; but for an exceedingly rare few, this means something in between. A _phylactery of the failed_ has a minute chance of coming into being anytime a spellcaster attempts to achieve lichdom and fails (equivalent to 1 in 100). In such cases, the magicuser's body is destroyed, but the phylactery he prepared remains and is invested with a remnant of his shattered consciousness. The creature that opens a _phylactery of the failed_ must immediately succeed at a DC 30 Will saving throw or be affected by a disease-like curse known as a parasitic soul (detailed below). Those affected by a parasitic soul have their own personality and sanity overwhelmed by the remnant ambitions and memories of the would-be lich whose destruction created the phylactery. If the cursed creature is killed by the parasitic soul, her body is animated 1 day later as a lich with the same memories and abilities of the magic-user who created the phylactery, essentially allowing that spellcaster to finally achieve lichdom. The cursed creature cannot be returned to life until the lich is destroyed.
  If the parasitic soul is excised from a victim, it returns to the phylactery and attempts to infect the next creature to open the box. The parasitic soul can only infect one creature at a time. While a creature is infected by a parasitic soul, the phylactery the soul is bound to has no dangerous properties and cannot infect other creatures.
  The invasive nature of _phylacteries of the failed_ has spawned the creation of several other pernicious magic items, such as the disease-spreading _death's head coffer_ (see _Pathfinder Adventure Path #8_).
  **Parasitic Soul** Curse and disease; _save_ Will DC 30; _frequency_ 1/day; _effect_ 1d6 Intelligence damage; _cure_ a parasitic soul can only be cured by casting both a spell that prevents the target from being mentally controlled (like _protection from evil_) and _remove curse_."
Destruction: |
  "Casting _resurrection_ upon a _phylactery of the failed_ restores the would-be lich to life as a living spellcaster with the statistics the magic-user had before attempting the transformation into lichdom. This destroys the phylactery, but brings a powerful evil spellcaster back into being."

##### Magical properties

**Caster level:** 18 **Aura:** strong necromancy

### Description

Not every _[[monsters/Lich|lich]]_ that attempts the transition to undeath succeeds. For most, this means an excruciating, spellblasted death; for a small fraction of others, this means a typically brief but painful existence as a failed _lich_; but for an exceedingly rare few, this means something in between. A _[[items/Wondrous Item/Phylactery of the Failed|phylactery of the failed]]_ has a minute chance of coming into being anytime a spellcaster attempts to achieve lichdom and fails (equivalent to 1 in 100). In such cases, the magicuser's body is destroyed, but the phylactery he prepared remains and is invested with a remnant of his shattered consciousness. The creature that opens a _phylactery of the failed_ must immediately succeed at a DC 30 Will saving throw or be affected by a disease-like curse known as a _[[spells/Parasitic Soul|parasitic soul]]_ (detailed below). Those affected by a _parasitic soul_ have their own personality and sanity overwhelmed by the remnant ambitions and memories of the would-be _lich_ whose _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ created the phylactery. If the cursed creature is killed by the _parasitic soul_, her body is _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Animated|animated]]_ 1 day later as a _lich_ with the same memories and abilities of the magic-user who created the phylactery, essentially allowing that spellcaster to finally achieve lichdom. The cursed creature cannot be returned to life until the _lich_ is destroyed.

If the _parasitic soul_ is excised from a victim, it returns to the phylactery and attempts to infect the next creature to open the box. The _parasitic soul_ can only infect one creature at a time. While a creature is infected by a _parasitic soul_, the phylactery the soul is bound to has no dangerous properties and cannot infect other creatures.

The invasive nature of phylacteries of the failed has spawned the creation of several other pernicious magic items, such as the disease-spreading _[[items/Wondrous Item/Death's Head Coffer|death's head coffer]]_ (see Pathfinder Adventure Path #8).

**_Parasitic Soul_** Curse and disease; save Will DC 30; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Intelligence damage; cure a _parasitic soul_ can only be cured by casting both a spell that prevents the target from being mentally controlled (like _[[spells/Protection From Evil|protection from evil]]_) and _[[spells/Remove Curse|remove curse]]_.

### _Destruction_

Casting _[[spells/Resurrection|resurrection]]_ upon a _phylactery of the failed_ restores the would-be _lich_ to life as a living spellcaster with the statistics the magic-user had before attempting the _[[spells/Transformation|transformation]]_ into lichdom. This destroys the phylactery, but brings a powerful evil spellcaster back into being.
