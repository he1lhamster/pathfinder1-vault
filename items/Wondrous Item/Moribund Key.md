Description: |
  "Greater agents of the Whispering Way use these silver medallions as keys to their sanctuaries. Each _moribund key_ bears an engraved skull with two gray, burned-out _ioun stones_ for eyes. Small openings line the coin's outer edge. By turning the skull's head, an inner plate marked with runic symbols lines up with these openings to establish different combinations. Each setting matches symbols inscribed on objects of great importance to the cult, such as statues, paintings, and doors. The proper arrangement of these runes activates stored spell effects in such objects, including powerful wards, _programmed images_, or the release of _arcane locks_. The bearer of a moribund key can cast _message_ at will, and _spectral hand_ and _vampiric touch_ 3 times per day. In addition, the skull's eyes glow when undead approach within 60 feet. A _moribund key_ bestows one negative level on any good creature carrying it. The negative level remains as long as the medallion is carried and cannot be overcome in any way while the medallion is in that creature's possession."
