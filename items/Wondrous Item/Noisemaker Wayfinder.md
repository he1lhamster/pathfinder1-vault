Title: "Noisemaker Wayfinder"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "7000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "3"
Aura: "faint abjuration"
Description: |
  "This decorative _wayfinder_ appears to be made of gold, and its face is marked with white and silver motifs of roosters. Whenever the wielder of a _noisemaker wayfinder_ falls asleep, the roosters decorating the _wayfinder_ change to crescent moons. Whenever a Tiny or larger creature comes within 20 feet of the _wayfinder's_ bearer while she is asleep and this magic item is on her person, the _noisemaker wayfinder_ immediately begins vibrating, buzzing, and ringing loudly as long as there is a clear line of effect between the _wayfinder's_ bearer and the triggering creature. The sound from this effect easily travels 60 feet, as the audible _alarm_ version of the _alarm_ spell. A creature that speaks the password (determined by the wielder and assigned to the _wayfinder_ before she falls asleep) does not set off the alarm.
  When the _wayfinder's_ alarm is triggered, the violent motion of the _noisemaker wayfinder_ continues until the wielder presses a button on the side of the device. If the wielder of a _noisemaker wayfinder_ is affected by a magical sleep effect (such as that caused by a _sleep_ spell) and the alarm is triggered, the constant buzzing and vibration of the _wayfinder_ allows the wielder to attempt a saving throw each round at the end of her turn to end the sleep effect and gives her a +2 circumstance bonus on such saves. Other sleeping creatures within hearing range of the _wayfinder_ wake up from normal sleep, but not magical sleep. The bearer of a _noisemaker wayfinder_ may disable its audible alarm function at will by pressing down on the compass needle."

Whenever a Tiny or larger creature comes within 20 feet of the _wayfinder_'s bearer while she is asleep and this magic item is on her person, the _noisemaker wayfinder_ immediately begins vibrating, buzzing, and ringing loudly as long as there is a clear line of effect between the _wayfinder_'s bearer and the triggering creature.
