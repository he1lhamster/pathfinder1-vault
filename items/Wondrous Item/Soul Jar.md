Title: "Soul Jar"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "5000 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "15"
Aura: "strong necromancy"
Description: |
  "An empty _soul jar_ can be used to contain a soul that has been successfully trapped in a black sapphire via _soul bind_. Holding the gemstone against the soul jar's lid for 1 full round transfers the soul in the gem to the _soul jar_ (which can hold the soul of a creature of up to 20 Hit Dice), leaving the black sapphire unharmed 50% of the time. The rest of the time, transferring the soul from gem to jar shatters the black sapphire. A creature that can use _soul bind_ as a spell-like ability (and thus does not use a focus) can automatically place a captured soul in a held _soul jar_ as the spell-like ability is used. A soul in a _soul jar_ cannot travel to the Boneyard to be judged, but can be restored to life via _resurrection_ or more powerful magic. A _soul jar_ can contain only one soul at a time. _Soul jars_ are fragile (hardness 1, hp 10); if a _soul jar_ is broken, the soul held within immediately escapes to the Boneyard."
