Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "4180 gp"
Weight: "6 lbs."
Slot: "Body"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "faint transmutation"
Description: |
  "This hole-ridden burlap robe would appear completely worthless if not for the immaculate red velvet lining its interior. When worn inside out, a _liar's robe_ enshrouds the wearer in a continually shifting array of colors, features, and faces that obscure his entire appearance and make physical recognition all but impossible. This effect lasts for 1 hour, during which time the wearer can go back and forth between wearing the robe inside out (disguising himself) and right side out (revealing his true form) any number of times. Witnesses to a creature wearing a _liar's robe_ must use _true seeing_ or a similar effect in order to pierce through this disguise; otherwise, they see the wearer only as a continually shifting humanoid form. The wearer's voice, scent, and other tangible cues are also continually altered and distorted, though indirect magical means of identification (such as _detect thoughts_ or _locate creature_) may still be used to recognize the individual. Since even the most magically disinclined individuals can clearly tell that the wearer is enshrouded in an illusion, a _liar's robe_ is typically used in circumstances when it's appropriate to protect the wearer's anonymity without the wearer feigning another identity or hiding her presence."

### Description

This hole-ridden burlap robe would appear completely worthless if not for the immaculate red velvet lining its interior. When worn inside out, a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Liar's Robe|liar's robe]]_ enshrouds the wearer in a continually shifting array of colors, features, and faces that obscure his entire appearance and make physical recognition all but impossible. This effect lasts for 1 hour, during which time the wearer can go back and forth between wearing the robe inside out (disguising himself) and right side out (revealing his _[[spells/True Form|true form]]_) any number of times. Witnesses to a creature wearing a _liar's robe_ must use _[[spells/True Seeing|true seeing]]_ or a similar effect in order to pierce through this disguise; otherwise, they see the wearer only as a continually shifting humanoid form. The wearer's voice, _[[universal monster rules/Scent|scent]]_, and other tangible cues are also continually altered and distorted, though indirect magical means of identification (such as _[[spells/Detect Thoughts|detect thoughts]]_ or _[[spells/Locate Creature|locate creature]]_) may still be used to recognize the individual. Since even the most magically disinclined individuals can clearly tell that the wearer is enshrouded in an illusion, a _liar's robe_ is typically used in circumstances when it's appropriate to protect the wearer's anonymity without the wearer feigning another identity or hiding her presence.
