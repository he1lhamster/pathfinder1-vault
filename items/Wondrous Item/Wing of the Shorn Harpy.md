Description: |
  "This talisman is made from the bloody tip of a harpy's wing, its end capped in gold and its stringy black feathers still spackled with dried gore. No larger than a human hand, it served as a good luck charm for Celeste Wynne, a famed harpy hunter from Varisia. Celeste traveled throughout Golarion hunting the cruel creatures after one attacked and killed her mother; she is best known as the slayer of the Harpy Queens, a contingent of three powerful harpy rangers who once laired in the Kodar Mountains.
  Some say Celeste developed an immunity to harpies' captivating songs, allowing the sorcerer a distinct tactical advantage when she was fighting these dangerous beasts. Others say she learned how to use sonic magic to turn the tides against the monsters. Regardless, the wing tip still carries the psychic energy of one who had mastered fighting such enemies.
  An occultist of 10th level or higher who has learned the evocation implement school and uses the _wing of the shorn harpy_ as an implement can replace the evocation spells he knows with the following: 1st— _ear-piercing scream_, 2nd— _sonic scream_, 3rd— _blast barrier_, 4th— _shout_, 5th— _sonic thrust_, 6th— _leashed shackles_. The occultist cannot use the wing to cast spells whose level is higher than that of the highest-level spell he knows."
