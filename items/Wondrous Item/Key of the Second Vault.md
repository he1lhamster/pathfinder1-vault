Once per day, the bearer can speak a command word and summon a two-headed eagle as if using _summon monster II_ (the eagle's extra head does not grant it an extra attack). This eagle obeys the bearer's commands as if they shared a common language. While the key is worn as a pendant or held in hand, the bearer gains a +2 bonus on Appraise checks to assess an object's value."
