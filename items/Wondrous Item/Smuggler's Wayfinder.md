Price: "2000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate conjuration"
Description: |
  "This time-weathered _wayfinder_ lacks any notable features. Despite its routine appearance, a _smuggler's wayfinder_ has an additional ability generally known only to the person using it. When a command word is spoken, the compass's interior is replaced with a small extradimensional space that can hold up to 10 pounds of material occupying no more than 1 cubic foot of space. This material must be able to fit through the 3-inch-diameter opening in the compass's face (such as a thin glass vial, coins, small jewelry, or a rolled-up piece of paper). While the extradimensional space is accessible, all other properties of the _wayfinder_ cease to function, including any resonant _ioun stone_ powers. While the extradimensional space is hidden, the _smuggler's wayfinder_ emits an aura of faint evocation, as a standard _wayfinder_."
