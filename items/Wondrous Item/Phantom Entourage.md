Description: |
  "This fashionable silken shawl is incredibly light. Once per day on command, a _phantom entourage_ surrounds its wearer with 1d4+2 illusions of attractive socialites. These illusions cluster closely around the wearer, laugh at his jokes, and generally stroke his ego with fawning flattery. This functions similarly to a _mirror image_ spell, except an attacker has a 50% chance of ignoring the effect (as the illusions don't match the wearer). In addition, for every two illusory socialites the wearer currently has attending to him, he gains a +1 circumstance bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Perform (sing) checks and takes a –2 penalty on Stealth checks. This effect lasts for 6 hours."
