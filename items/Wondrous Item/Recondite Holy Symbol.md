Description: |
  "A _recondite holy symbol_ is a silver amulet depicting an old or obscure religious symbol that has long fallen out of common use within the religion in question. Each religion has its own unique obsolete emblems, but older religions are likely to have a greater variety of emblems than newer religions. For example, a _recondite holy symbol of Desna_ might depict a single shining star (as she was sometimes depicted in ancient Azlant) or a silhouetted woman astride an elk (as she is depicted by ancient Kellid tradition), rather than her common butterfly symbol. A successful DC 15 Knowledge (religion) check is required to identify the deity or religion associated with a _recondite holy symbol_, allowing the wielder to utilize the holy symbol without identifying her faith to the uninformed. When the wielder uses an appropriate _recondite holy symbol_ to channel energy, she gains a +3 competence bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks related to her deity or religion for 1 minute."
