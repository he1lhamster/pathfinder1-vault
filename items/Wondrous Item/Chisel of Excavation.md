  "This chisel, made from the tooth of a purple worm, functions as a masterwork tool for Craft and Profession checks related to working stone. Beyond that, it grants its owner a burrow speed of 20 feet for up to 5 minutes per day. These minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. When a creature holds a _chisel of excavation_ and casts a spontaneous spell with both the earth descriptor and one or more metamagic feats applied, the total level adjustment to the spell is reduced by 1 (to a minimum adjustment of 0)."
