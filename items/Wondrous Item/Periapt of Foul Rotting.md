Description: |
  "This engraved gem appears to be of little value. If any character keeps the periapt in her possession for more than 24 hours, she contracts a terrible rotting affliction that permanently drains 1 point of Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma every week. The periapt (and the affliction) can be removed only by application of a _remove curse_ spell followed by a _cure disease_ and then a _heal_, _miracle_, _limited wish_, or _wish_ spell. The rotting can also be countered by crushing a _periapt of health_ and sprinkling its dust upon the afflicted character (a full-round action), whereupon the _periapt of foul rotting_ likewise crumbles to dust."
