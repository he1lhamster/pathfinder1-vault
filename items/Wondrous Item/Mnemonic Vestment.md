Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Body"
Caster level: "17"
Aura: "strong transmutation"
Description: |
  "The surface of this delicate-looking blue silk robe is adorned with tiny embossed runes across its entire surface. If the wearer is a spontaneous caster, once per day she may use a spell slot to cast a spell from a written source (such as a scroll or spellbook) as if she knew that spell. The spell must be on her spell list, the same spell level or lower than the expended spell slot, and the same type of spell (arcane or divine) as the spell slot expended. The caster must also understand the written source (such as using Decipher Script or _read magic_) and be carrying it. Activating the robe is not an action, but casting the spell otherwise works as normal, including casting time, providing components or foci, and so on. Using a _mnemonic vestment's_ properties does not consume the written source. A _mnemonic vestment_ must be worn for 24 consecutive hours before using its effects."
