Slot: "Eyes"
Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate abjuration"
Description: |
  "Crafted by the Arclords of Nex, these golden-white lenses rest in crystal frames that fit comfortably over the eyes. Any creatures conjured by _summon monster_ or a similar spell in the wearer's field of vision appear to the wearer as though they were surrounded by a shimmering, purple glow. The wearer sees non-native creatures that have been called by other forms of magic (such as _planar ally_ or _gate_) outlined in a blue glow. This affects only creatures of which the wearer is already aware. It doesn't bypass concealment or stealth, nor does it work if the target is under the effect of an illusion spell that the wearer hasn't seen through.
  Once per day when the wearer hits a summoned or called creature with a weapon, the wearer can concentrate on that target, attempting to banish it back to its place of origin. This is treated as a _dismissal_ spell targeting the creature, which must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be sent back to its home plane."
