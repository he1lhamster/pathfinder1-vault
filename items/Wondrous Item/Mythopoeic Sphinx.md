Description: |
  "Carved from sandstone, this small stone statuette depicts a female sphinx and is a powerful tool for divinations. Once per week, the possessor can ask the _mythopoeic sphinx_ about an important person, place, or thing. The sphinx then animates and relates legends about the subject in either Common, Draconic, or Sphinx, as if with _legend lore_. In addition, a _mythopoeic sphinx_ can be used as a focus component that replaces the normal focus or material components for the _augury_, _divination_, and _legend lore_ spells. Lastly, the possessor of a _mythopoeic sphinx_ gains a +4 bonus on Diplomacy checks to influence sphinxes.
  The possessor of a _mythopoeic sphinx_ can also use the figurine to call a gynosphinx to his presence and bargain for her services as if using _planar ally_ to call upon an outsider. A _mythopoeic sphinx_ permanently loses all of its magical abilities when used to call a sphinx in this way, becoming a mundane stone statuette, regardless of whether or not the called sphinx agrees to serve the possessor."
