Description: |
  "A _mythic amulet of the Abyss_ bears the rune of a single demon lord on its face, indicating the lord to which the amulet is attuned. At its basest, a _mythic amulet of the Abyss_ functions as an unholy symbol to this demon lord as well as a _phylactery of faithfulness_.
  A _mythic amulet of the Abyss_ grants its wearer all three of the demon lord's boons, regardless of the wearer's actual level. It grants all of the first boon's spell-like abilities at will. The amulet found in this adventure is associated with Baphomet, and as such it grants the following boons (see _Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lords of Chaos, Book of the Damned, Vol. 2_ for details on other demon lords' boons):
  Additionally, the wearer of the amulet gains a +4 enhancement bonus to natural armor, immunity to electricity and poison, and resistance 10 to acid, cold, and fire.
  Any lawful or good character who wears this amulet gains 2 negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the amulet is worn. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they can't be overcome in any way as long as the amulet is worn."
Destruction: |
  "A _mythic amulet of the Abyss_ can be destroyed as a swift action by the demon lord to which it is attuned, up to a range of 120 feet."

A _mythic amulet of the Abyss_ grants its wearer all three of the demon lord's boons, regardless of the wearer's actual level.
