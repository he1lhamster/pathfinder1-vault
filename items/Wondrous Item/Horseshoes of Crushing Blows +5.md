Aura: "faint evocation"
Description: |
  "_Horseshoes of crushing blows_ grant an enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls made with hoof attacks; this bonus varies based on the item's price. Alternatively, as described for the _amulet of mighty fists_, they can grant hooves melee weapon special abilities so long as they can be applied to unarmed attacks. _Horseshoes of crushing blows_ cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +5. _Horseshoes of crushing blows_ are crafted as sets of four, with each shoe in the set bearing the same enhancements. All four shoes must be worn by the same animal to be effective.
  _Horseshoes of crushing blows_ may be crafted out of special materials, gaining the usual benefits. For purposes of pricing, they count as a single one-handed weapon weighing 4 pounds (for example, _adamantine horseshoes of crushing blows_ would cost an additional 3,000 gp). The materials needed to make _cold iron horseshoes of crushing blows_ add no extra costs in and of themselves, but enhancing cold iron horseshoes of crushing blows increases the price by the usual 2,000 gp."
