Description: |
  "This minty-smelling salve is commonly used by Calistrian elves to render unsuspecting victims more susceptible to magical manipulation, typically to glean information from them in intricate revenge plots. When applied to the skin as a standard action—usually incorporated into a massage or cosmetic procedure— _Kyonin bliss_ creates a sense of mild euphoria that lasts for 10 minutes (Will DC 14 negates). The salve can be applied to an unwilling creature as a melee touch attack. A creature affected by _Kyonin bliss_ must attempt a concentration check to cast spells (DC = 15 + the spell's level). Additionally, the victim rolls twice and takes the lower result on saving throws against divinations, enchantments, and illusions. This is a mind-affecting poison effect."
