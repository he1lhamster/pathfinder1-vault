Price: "15000 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate evocation"
Description: |
  "This item looks like and functions as a _lucky horseshoe_. In addition, if the horseshoe is placed prominently over the entrance of a building and left there for a period of at least 8 hours, it provides good luck to all those who spend time within that building. In order to gain this benefit, a character must spend at least 8 consecutive hours within the building; the benefit lasts for 24 hours. A single _communal lucky horseshoe_ can provide its benefit to any number of creatures per day, but each creature can gain the benefits of only one lucky horseshoe at a time. Once a creature invokes the _lucky horseshoe's_ ability, she can't benefit from another _lucky horseshoe_ for 24 hours, though time she spends inside the building during that interval counts toward the 8 consecutive hours required to gain the _communal lucky horseshoe's_ benefit for the next day."
