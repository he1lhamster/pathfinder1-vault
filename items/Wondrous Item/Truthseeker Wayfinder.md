Description: |
  "This _wayfinder_ is crafted from polished gold and when viewed in bright light is highly reflective— resembling a mirror more than it does simple metal. A _truthseeker wayfinder_ allows the wielder to cast _zone of truth_ for up to 7 minutes per day (Will DC 14 negates). This duration doesn't need to be continuous, but must be used in 1-minute increments. If a creature saves against this effect once, it is immune to the effect for 24 hours. Creatures that fail their saves are granted a new save each time the effect is activated anew. Once per day, the wielder of a _truthseeker wayfinder_ can gain the benefits of _discern lies_ for up to 7 rounds (Will DC 16 negates). When the _truthseeker wayfinder_ senses the target creature issue an intentional falsehood, it vibrates just enough to be perceptible to the wielder but no one else."
