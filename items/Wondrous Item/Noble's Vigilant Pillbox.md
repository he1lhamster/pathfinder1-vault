Description: |
  "This heart-shaped charm is set with three pearls: one white, one silver, and one black. Inside, a tiny compartment usually contains smelling salts (page 101) or alchemist's kindness (page 100). Each pearl has a primary, passive ability and a secondary, active ability that activates if it is removed from the setting and swallowed (a standard action, as if drinking a potion). Swallowing a pearl destroys it. A command word activates the primary abilities of all three pearls for 1 round.
  When activated, the white pearl detects poison in a 10- foot radius around the wearer, dulling to a dark gray if poison is within range. If swallowed, it grants the benefit of a _delay poison_ spell.
  The silver pearl detects diseases in a 10-foot radius, turning bright blue on discovery. If swallowed, it grants the benefit of a _remove disease_ spell.
  The black pearl turns white if any invisible creature is within 10 feet of the wearer. If swallowed, it grants the benefits of _see invisibility_ for 1 minute.
  A charms found with missing pearls has its price reduced appropriately; a white pearl is worth 750 gp, a silver pearl is worth 1,150 gp, and black pearl is worth 1,700 gp."
