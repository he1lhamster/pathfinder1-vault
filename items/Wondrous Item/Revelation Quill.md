Caster level: "20"
Aura: "strong divination"
Description: |
  "The first _revelation quills_ were created by the followers of the Peacock Spirit. Since the fall of Thassilon, the method for creating them has been lost. The few _revelation quills_ that remain today continue to function, drawing their revelations, it is said, from the Peacock Spirit itself. The quill is fashioned from a peacock's tail feather. Its nib is made of bone, and when held in one's hand, the quill seems strangely heavy. If placed in an empty vial or other glass container of similar size and left there for an hour, a _revelation quill_ fills that container with ink. The ink created is of a random color 50% of the time, otherwise the ink is black.
  While a _revelation quill_ can certainly function as a standard writing implement, its true strength lies in its ability to answer questions. Once per day, if the user concentrates on a specific future goal, event, or activity occurring within the coming week, the _revelation quill_ takes over and writes out a short phrase in response, often in the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen, much in the same way the _divination_ spell functions. Once per week, the user may use the quill in the same way to cast _contact other plane_ instead, asking up to 10 questions of the mysterious intellect that guides the _revelation quill_."
Destruction: |
  "The quill must be tricked into revealing the method of destroying itself without asking it to reveal that method."

Its nib is made of bone, and when held in one's hand, the quill seems strangely heavy.
