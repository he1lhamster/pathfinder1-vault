Title: "Bracelets of Stone"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "26760 gp"
Weight: "4 lbs."
Slot: "Wrists"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate conjuration"
Description: |
  "These rugged stone armbands slip on easily and swiftly adjust to a size appropriate for the wearer. Once per day, the wearer can create a wall of stone up to 2 inches thick and 45 feet long (or 90 feet long, if the thickness is reduced to 1 inch). For the purpose of this effect, the _bracelets of stone_ count as a stone surface that the _wall of stone_ can merge with, and they magically provide the wearer the strength necessary to support any _wall of stone_ so created. Thus, the wearer can create a bridge or wall in nearly any location as long as he is standing adjacent to a point where the bracelets can connect to it. If the bracelets are used this way, the wearer can't move from this space and is considered flat-footed during this time, but may end the effect as an immediate action (thus destroying the wall). If either bracelet is taken off or a portion of the wall is breached or destroyed, this effect immediately ends and the _wall of stone_ crumbles to dust."
