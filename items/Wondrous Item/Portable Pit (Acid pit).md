  "This rolled cloth resembles a rug or sheet. If the cloth is unfurled on a flat horizontal surface and its command word spoken as a standard action, its 10-foot-by-10-foot surface changes to match the coloration of the surrounding ground.

Creatures that trigger this effect and those adjacent to the _portable pit_ when it transforms must succeed a DC 20 Reflex save or fall into the pit, taking damage and suffering additional effects (see below). The extradimensional pit persists for 1 minute before collapsing (harmlessly expelling any trapped creatures into an adjacent space) and becoming inert for 24 hours. If the command word is spoken a second time, a _portable pit_ transforms back into cloth and can be picked up, moved, or stored.
  Creatures notice a concealed _portable pit_ with a successful DC 20 Perception check. Those trapped within can attempt to climb out; the Climb DC for the pit's smooth walls is 20.
  **Acid Pit**: Woven from green and yellow fabric, a _portable acid pit_ drops victims 30 feet into a pool of boiling acid. The fall deals 2d6 points of damage and an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal damage, while the acid deals 2d6 points of acid damage every round. The film of slick acid coating the pit walls imposes a –10 circumstance penalty on Climb checks. Moderate conjuration; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, _acid pit_.
  **Blunt Pit**: Created in a spiraling weave of blue and brown wool, a _portable blunt pit_ drops the victim 20 feet onto hard-packed earth, and the victim takes 2d6 points of damage from the fall. Faint conjuration; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, _create pit_.
  **Hungry Pit**: Spun from blood-red silk and studded with tiny teeth, a _portable hungry pit_ transforms into a 40-foot-deep pit, dealing 4d6 points of damage to any victims who fall into it. Its ravenous walls then begin to grind like the stomach of a massive beast, dealing 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage every round to any creature in the pit. The convulsing walls impose a –15 circumstance penalty on Climb checks. Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, _hungry pit_.
  **Persistent Pit**: This pit drops victims 20 feet, dealing 2d6 points of damage, and resumes its disguised form (expelling anyone trapped within) after 1 minute like other _portable pits_, but doesn't become inert once activated. A _portable persistent pit_ continues to activate whenever a new creature walks across it. Faint conjuration; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, _create pit_. **Spiked Pit**: A _portable spiked pit_ is woven from cotton fibers and thorns. Once activated, it drops victims 20 feet onto a bed of spikes. Each victim takes 2d6 points of damage from the fall, and lands on 1d4 spikes (Atk +10, 1d4+2 damage each). Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _spiked pit_."

Creatures that trigger this effect and those adjacent to the portable pit when it transforms must succeed a DC 20 Reflex save or fall into the pit, taking damage and suffering additional effects (see below). The extradimensional pit persists for 1 minute before collapsing (harmlessly expelling any trapped creatures into an adjacent space) and becoming inert for 24 hours.
