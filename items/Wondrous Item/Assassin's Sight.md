Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "5250 gp"
Weight: "4 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "faint divination"
Description: |
  "This black telescopic sight is made of lusterless metal and features a thick glass lens. It can be mounted on the stock of a light or heavy crossbow, but not a hand crossbow. An _assassin's sight_ allows the wielder to make ranged sneak attacks from greater distances than normal. This sight has two settings: 0–30 feet and 30–60 feet. A character using a crossbow equipped with an _assassin's sight_ can make sneak attacks against foes within the selected range. For example, by setting the range to 30–60 feet, a character can make sneak attacks against creatures only if they are between 30 and 60 feet of the wielder; attacks against targets closer than 30 feet or farther than 60 feet would not count as sneak attacks, even if they met all the other requirements for making a sneak attack. Setting the range on an _assassin's sight_ is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity."
