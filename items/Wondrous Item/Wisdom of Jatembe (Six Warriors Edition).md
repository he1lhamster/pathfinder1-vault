  **Jatembe's Vindication (Su):** The Old-Mage's teachings are a call to arms for all good spellcasters, stressing the importance of using one's talents altruistically and philanthropically, and his teachings foster the power of good in even the most apathetic heart. Expend this boon when you cast a spell that targets one or more creatures. The spell gains the good descriptor as well as a +2 sacred bonus on caster level checks to overcome the spell resistance of evil creatures. An evil creature cannot use this preparation ritual."
