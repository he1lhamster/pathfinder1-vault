Description: |
  "In areas where divine magic is readily available, _speak with dead_ has captured many a murderer; this serum was invented by assassins to silence their victims. _Murderer's silence_ prevents a corpse from communicating via _speak with dead_ by dissolving the victim's vocal organs. To use this item, the thick black liquid must be slowly poured down the throat of the corpse (a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity). The following round, the corpse's tongue, vocal cords, and lips deteriorate and the corpse becomes incapable of responding to _speak with dead_. Other means of interrogating the spirit of the departed still function normally. Magic that restores the flesh to a corpse doesn't restore any parts rotted away by _murderer's silence_. This item has no effect on parts of the body other than those listed. The listed is for a single dose."
