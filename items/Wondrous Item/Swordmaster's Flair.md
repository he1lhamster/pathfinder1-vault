Non-swashbucklers can use the tokens, but unless they have another way of gaining panache, they can use the ability only once per day. A character can benefit from only one token at a time; holding a second token provides no additional benefit. There are four types of tokens, each offering a different benefit.

  _Green Glove_: The user can spend 1 panache point as a swift action to ignore the effects of difficult terrain until the end of her next turn.
  _Red Sash_: The user can spend 1 panache point as an immediate action to attempt a combat maneuver check to trip a creature that has charged and ended its charge in a space within the user's melee reach. This combat maneuver does not provoke an attack of opportunity, it's attempted before the attack at the end of the charge, and the sash's user gains a +2 bonus on the check. If the check is successful, the attacker can't make an attack at the end of its charge.
  _White Lace Kerchief_: The user can spend 1 panache point as a swift action to pinpoint an unseen, adjacent enemy and gains the benefits of the Blind Fight feat for 1 round."
