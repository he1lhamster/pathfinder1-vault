Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "34000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Body"
Caster level: "12"
Aura: "strong transmutation"
Description: |
  "This ankle-length black robe, cut in the style favored by Orthodox priests, bears little outward ornamentation beyond its gold buttons, though subtle occult symbols embroidered in black thread decorate the skirt's hem. The _cassock of the Black Monk_ grants a +4 luck bonus to the wearer's touch AC. In addition, while wearing the cassock, an oracle of the occult mystery (see page 68) gains access to the spectral spells revelation (see page 69) and may use it as if he had it as a normal class feature. If the wearer already has that revelation, he can use that ability one additional time per day. This ability has no effect if worn by a non-oracle. If the wearer is an oracle but does not have the occult mystery, once per day he can cast a spell with the Ectoplasmic Spell feat (_Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide_ 158) as a standard action that does not increase the level of the spell. This ability has no effect if the wearer is a non-oracle."

This ankle-length black robe, cut in the style favored by Orthodox priests, bears little outward ornamentation beyond its gold buttons, though subtle occult symbols embroidered in black thread decorate the skirt's hem. The _[[items/Wondrous Item/Cassock of the Black Monk|cassock of the Black Monk]]_ grants a +4 luck bonus to the wearer's touch AC.
