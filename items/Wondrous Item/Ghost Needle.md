Title: "Ghost Needle"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "3600 gp"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "13"
Aura: "strong illusion, strong transmutation"
Description: |
  "This bone needle must be inserted into living flesh (a standard action) to function, dealing the creature 1d4 points of damage and causing it to appear ghostly and translucent for up to 30 minutes, as if using _ghostly disguise_. If the creature negates all the damage (such as with damage reduction), this also negates the _ghostly disguise_ effect, as the needle fails to penetrate his flesh.
  In addition, as a swift action, a creature with an embedded ghost needle can choose to become partially incorporeal until the beginning of its next turn. During this time, the creature can enter or pass through solid objects as though it had the incorporeal special ability, natural weapons or unarmed strikes it uses are treated as if they had the _ghost touch_ weapon special ability, and any spell the creature casts is treated as if it had applied the Ectoplasmic Spell metamagic feat to it. The creature takes 1d4 points of damage each round it spends in this quasi-incorporeal state, and each round spent in this state expends 10 minutes of the ghost needle's duration. If there are fewer than 10 minutes of duration remaining, it can't choose to remain incorporeal. A _ghost needle_ crumbles to dust after use."

### Description

This bone needle must be inserted into living flesh (a standard action) to function, dealing the creature 1d4 points of damage and causing it to appear ghostly and translucent for up to 30 minutes, as if using _[[spells/Ghostly Disguise|ghostly disguise]]_. If the creature negates all the damage (such as with _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_), this also negates the _ghostly disguise_ effect, as the needle fails to penetrate his flesh.

During this time, the creature can enter or pass through solid objects as though it had the _incorporeal_ special ability, natural weapons or unarmed strikes it uses are treated as if they had the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]]_ weapon special ability, and any spell the creature casts is treated as if it had applied the _[[feats/Ectoplasmic Spell|Ectoplasmic Spell]]_ metamagic feat to it. The creature takes 1d4 points of damage each round it spends in this quasi-incorporeal state, and each round spent in this state expends 10 minutes of the _ghost needle_'s duration. If there are fewer than 10 minutes of duration remaining, it can't choose to remain _incorporeal_. A _ghost needle_ crumbles to dust after use.
