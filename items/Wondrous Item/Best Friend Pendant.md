Description: |
  "This silver necklace holds a miniature gilded cage, meant to rest against the wearer's chest. Once per day as a full-round action, the wearer can absorb a single willing Tiny or Small animal into the necklace. Absorbed creatures appear within the cage as miniature versions of themselves rendered in silver. The animal is effectively in stasis and can't communicate, perceive the world around it, or grant any abilities or bonuses (such as a familiar's skill bonus) while absorbed. Animal companions, familiars, or mounts can enter the cage without problem, but coercing other animals into the cage requires a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check. Only one animal can inhabit the pendant at a time.
  The wearer can causes the animal to reappear within 10 feet by speaking a command word and opening the door of the cage as a standard action. A creature can remain within the cage for 48 hours, after which it is forcibly ejected and must wait 24 hours before reentering the cage. If a _best friend pendant_ is destroyed, any held animal is immediately ejected and is stunned for 1d4+1 rounds. A creature must be wearing the _best friend pendant_ in order to activate the item (for either of its uses), but can freely remove or don the item while an animal is stored within."
