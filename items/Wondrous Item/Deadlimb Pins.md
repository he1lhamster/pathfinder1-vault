Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "60000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "As a move action, the wielder may dip these two sharp, 4-inchlong pins into their paired vial to coat them in the viscous blueblack liquid within. This coating lasts 1 minute before dissipating. On a successful unarmed attack against a creature while both coated pins are held between the wielder's knuckles, the liquid flows under the skin of one of the target's limbs (wielder's choice; two limbs on a critical hit). The target must then attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save. On a failed save, an affected limb becomes withered and useless, anything held in the limb drops to the ground, and the victim cannot move the limb for 5 minutes. If an affected limb contributes to one of the creature's modes of movement (such as a leg), the creature's movement is halved.
  A creature may be affected by multiple instances of _deadlimb pins_. Generally, a creature with both legs affected by _deadlimb pins_ can only crawl to move, and a creature with both arms affected is unable to attack (unless they can make attacks with other body parts, of course). The exact consequences of applying multiple doses of _deadlimb pins_ to creatures with inhuman anatomies or unusual limbs are left to the GM's discretion.
  In order to function, _deadlimb pins_ must be used with the vial of liquid they were constructed with and vice-versa. One set of _deadlimb pins_ and their adjoining vial can be used 50 times before its magic is depleted."

### Description

As a move action, the wielder may dip these two sharp, 4-inchlong pins into their paired _[[items/Mundane/Vial|vial]]_ to coat them in the viscous blueblack liquid within. This coating lasts 1 minute before dissipating. On a successful unarmed attack against a creature while both coated pins are held between the wielder's knuckles, the liquid flows under the skin of one of the target's limbs (wielder's choice; two limbs on a critical hit). The target must then attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save. On a failed save, an affected limb becomes withered and useless, anything held in the limb drops to the ground, and the victim cannot move the limb for 5 minutes. If an affected limb contributes to one of the creature's modes of movement (such as a leg), the creature's movement is halved.

A creature may be affected by multiple instances of _[[items/Wondrous Item/Deadlimb Pins|deadlimb pins]]_. Generally, a creature with both legs affected by _deadlimb pins_ can only crawl to move, and a creature with both arms affected is unable to attack (unless they can make attacks with other body parts, of course). The exact consequences of applying multiple doses of _deadlimb pins_ to creatures with inhuman anatomies or unusual limbs are left to the GM's discretion.

In order to function, _deadlimb pins_ must be used with the _vial_ of liquid they were constructed with and vice-versa. One set of _deadlimb pins_ and their adjoining _vial_ can be used 50 times before its magic is depleted.
