Description: |
  "Crystal baubles that resemble insect wings line the edge of this luxurious but fraying cloak. The garment was once a cloak of displacement, but the harbinger spirit trapped within has warped and twisted it—now it offers false hope rather than security. The Shroud of Flies grants its wearer a +2 profane bonus to Constitution and +4 resistance bonus on Reflex and Will saves, but imposes a –6 penalty on Fortitude saves against disease.
  Three times per day, the wearer can brush another creature with the shawl to remove all lingering effects caused by a disease, poison, or curse, as per _break enchantment_, _remove curse_, or _remove disease_. These effects are not eliminated, and return immediately with all accrued penalties after 24 hours. Any creature embraced in this way must immediately succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or be infected with one of the following diseases: blinding sickness, cackle fever, devil chills, or leprosy. Any creature the wearer touches while offering medical aid, such as casting cure spells, administering a potion, or using the Heal skill, must likewise succeed at this Fortitude save or become infected.
  The _Shroud of Flies_ can be wielded as a net as well, but only against daemons. Any creature that has worn the shroud for at least 24 hours is considered proficient in its use as a weapon."
Destruction: |
  "While wearing the _Shroud of Flies_, a creature must infect itself with seven distinct plagues, then bathe in the cosmic fires of creation on the Positive Energy Plane."
