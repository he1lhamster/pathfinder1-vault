Price: "5200 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Shoulders"
Caster level: "3"
Aura: "faint transmutation"
Description: |
  "This white-hooded cloak is trimmed with seagull feathers. The cloak billows in the slightest breeze, and when the hood is drawn over the wearer's head, the cloak repels rainwater and seaspray, keeping the wearer dry. _Harborwing cloaks_ were made by Varisian mystery cultists (and put to less-sacred uses by Sczarni bandits) for centuries before Magnimar's founding, though they are used more widely today. Many who worship Ylimancha, empyreal lord of coastal waters, fisherfolk, and flying creatures, wear these cloaks.
  Three times per day, whenever the wearer of this cloak falls more than 5 feet, she can spend an immediate action to gain the benefits of _feather fall_. In addition, once per day, the wearer can command the cloak as a standard action to become a sheet of rippling, flowing water, causing attacks against her to take a 20% miss chance. While the cloak is in this liquid-like state, the wearer can use the Stealth skill to hide in rainy conditions (or similar areas, such as the spray of a waterfall) even if she is being observed, and she gains a +5 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks in such conditions. This effect lasts for 3 minutes, and the duration need not be used all at once, but it must be used in 1-minute increments."
