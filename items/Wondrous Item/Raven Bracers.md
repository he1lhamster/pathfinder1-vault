Title: "Raven Bracers"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "16600 gp"
Weight: "4 lbs."
Slot: "Hands"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate divination, moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "This pair of magnificent dark metal bracers is forged to depict the shape of a raven stretched over the wearer's forearm. Once prized by the last king of Zolurket, several additional _raven bracers_ were created in the mines' final days to aid the king's bodyguards in defending him and maintaining communications throughout the mine.
  While worn, these bracers can be used as a swift action to grant the _throwing_ and _returning_ magic weapon qualities to any held melee weapon; these qualities persist for 1 round. This ability can be used three times a day.
  In addition, the bracers may be removed and tossed into the air as a standard action, where they transform into a pair of identical black metallic ravens similar to _silver raven figurines of wondrous power_. Like those items, these ravens obey the wearer, and may each bear a message as if affected by the _animal messenger_ spell. The ravens can only take this shape once per week, retaining the form continuously for up to 24 hours.
  Once both of these ravens have delivered their messages (or once the 24-hour limt is reached), they both vanish in a cloud of smoke and return unerringly to the owner's hands via teleportation. If the item's owner is no longer on the same plane as the bracers when this event occurs, they merely revert to bracer form and fall to the ground, awaiting a new owner to find and claim them for their own use."
