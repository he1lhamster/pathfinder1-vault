### Description

This _[[items/Mundane/Mirror|mirror]]_ resembles an ordinary looking glass 5 feet tall by 2 feet wide. A creature who knows the proper commands can cause it to perform as follows.

* Read the thoughts of any creature reflected therein, as long as the creature controlling the _mirror_ is within 25 feet of the _mirror_, even if those thoughts are in an _[[monsters/Unknown|unknown]]_ language.
* View other places as if with clairvoyance, and the controller can even view locations on other planes if she is sufficiently familiar with them.
* Use it as a portal to visit other places. The controller first views the place with the clairvoyance function, then steps through the _mirror_ to the place pictured. Others can follow her through the _mirror_ if they like. An _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ portal remains on the other side where she arrives, and she can return through that portal. Once she returns, the portal closes. The portal closes on its own after 24 hours (trapping the user if she's still in the other place), and the user can also close it with a _[[spells/Command|command]]_ word. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 12 or higher might notice the portal just as they might notice a magical sensor from a _[[spells/Scrying|scrying]]_ spell. Any creature who steps through the portal appears in front of the _mirror_.
* Once per week the _mirror_ accurately answers one short question regarding a creature whose image is shown on its surface (giving answers similar to those from the _[[spells/Legend Lore|legend lore]]_ spell).
