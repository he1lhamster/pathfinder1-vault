Price: "8500 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Feet"
Caster level: "3"
Aura: "faint conjuration"
Description: |
  "On command, these rat-fur boots summon a rat swarm underneath the wearer that moves with her and acts as a living carpet. As a move action, the wearer can travel on the backs of the rats as they swim, moving up to 15 feet across the surface of calm waters. If surface conditions become worse than calm, the rats disperse and the wearer falls. On land, the swarm allows the wearer to ignore difficult terrain's effects on her movement for up to 15 feet of movement per round. The swarm can be used for up to 10 minutes per day. This duration doesn't need to be continuous, but must be used in 1-minute increments.
  If the wearer falls unconscious while _rat-tread boots_ are active, on the wearer's next turn the swarm tries to move her away from the nearest foe, moving 5 feet before dispersing. This movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If such movement is impossible, the swarm disperses.
  The swarm is a normal rat swarm, except its area doesn't exceed that of the wearer and it can't move out of the wearer's space. The swarm disperses when the effect's duration ends or when the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer. _Rat-tread boots_ grant the wearer immunity from the attacks of rat swarms, including their special attacks."
