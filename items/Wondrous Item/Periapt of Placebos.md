Description: |
  "What at first appears to be a fine gem dangling from a long, silver chain is in fact a cut and polished bezoar. This necklace—often mistaken for a _periapt of health_ or a _periapt of proof against poison_ —inspires its wearer with the utter conviction that he has been rendered immune to both disease and poison. While the necklace imparts no genuine protections, the strength of belief it imparts nonetheless grants its wearer a +2 morale bonus to all Fortitude saving throws against diseases and poisons.
  Unless the person identifying a _periapt of placebos_ succeeds at her Spellcraft check by 5 or more, she mistakenly believes it to be a more powerful protective necklace rather than discerning its true nature."
