  "This dark iron pin used to fasten a cloak or cape is the shape of a fly with glittering fragments of soul gems for eyes and is usually crafted by those who venerate Apollyon, the Horseman of Pestilence. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can exhale a cloud of black flies in a 15-foot cone. Any creature caught in the cone takes 8d6 points of slashing damage as the flies bite its flesh. A successful DC 18 Reflex save halves this damage. If a living creature takes damage from these flies, it must also succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 minute. Daemons are immune to these effects"
