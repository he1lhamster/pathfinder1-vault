Caster level: "13"
Aura: "strong illusion"
Description: |
  "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.
  This torch's magic tar retains the power of goblin songs. Whenever the owner holds the torch in hand while in the area of a bardic performance performed as a goblin song, it begins to emit a faint, whispered version of that song (audible with a DC 20 Perception check). If the wielder lights the torch at any time before the next dusk, its flame dances rhythmically to the goblin song it most recently witnessed, and emanates a crackling mimicry of the original singer's voice. The torch burns for 13 rounds or until it is no longer held in the user's hand, whichever comes first, during which time it produces the effect of the remembered bardic performance, using the torch's caster level as the effective bard level, and the wielder's Charisma modifier if necessary. If the torch's caster level would provide an insufficient bard level for the most recent performance, the torch has no effect beyond shedding light. The magic tar reforms after 1 week, allowing the torch to be used again. If the creature who last lit the torch was a goblin, the tar instead reforms in 24 hours."

This _[[items/Mundane/Torch|torch]]_'s magic tar retains the power of _[[monsters/Goblin|goblin]]_ songs. Whenever the owner holds the _torch_ in hand while in the area of a bardic performance performed as a _goblin_ song, it begins to emit a faint, whispered version of that song (audible with a DC 20 Perception check).
