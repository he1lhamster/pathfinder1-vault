Title: "Book of Extended Summoning (Lesser)"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "750 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "17"
Aura: "strong conjuration"
Description: |
  "This leather-bound book is inscribed with runes relating to outsiders and conjuration magic. It enhances spells that summon monsters. The user may apply the Extend Spell feat to these spells as they are cast. This does not change the spell slot of the altered spell. The book counts as a _metamagic rod_ for the purpose of combining multiple metamagic effects on a spell. A normal _book of extended summoning_ can be used with spells of 6th level or lower, while a lesser book can be used with spells of 3rd level or lower, and a greater book can be used with spells of 9th level or lower. Each book is keyed to a particular alignment (equal chances of chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) and only works when used to summon a creature with that alignment. Once the book is used, it crumbles into cold ash and is destroyed."
