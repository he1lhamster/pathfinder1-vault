Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "faint illusion"
Description: |
  "This shadowy, waterproof tome is 12 inches tall, 8 inches wide, and 1 inch thick. When viewed in dim, normal, or bright light, the tome's 1,000 ebon pages are blank and any new writing immediately fades from sight, as if erase had been cast upon the page. When viewed in darkness, however, each page becomes outlined with pale, silvery light and anything then written in the tome is recorded in similar, silvery light. Writings within the tome are protected as per _nondetection_. A _tome of dissolution_ can be used as a formula book or a spellbook; if so, extracts and spells can only be prepared from the tome when viewed in darkness. Necromancy spells, spells of the shadow subschool, and spells with the darkness or shadow descriptor take half as many pages when copied into a _tome of dissolution_ as they would in a normal spellbook or formula book."
