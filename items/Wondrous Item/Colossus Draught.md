  "Originating from Thuvia, this potent elixir is rumored to have first emerged from the infamous Citadel of the Alchemist. Each vial of _colossus draught_ is capped with an incredibly tight lid; a successful DC 22 Strength check is needed to open and allow access to the bubbling jade liquid within. Once the vial is opened, the contents must be imbibed within the next minute, or they spoil and have no effect.
  Drinking the _colossus draught_ imparts a temporary +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution and Strength, and increases the imbiber's size to the next larger category (as _enlarge person_, with all the resulting bonuses and penalties) for the next 24 hours. While under the effects of the elixir, the imbiber takes a –4 penalty on all Will saves as the fluid addles her mind."
