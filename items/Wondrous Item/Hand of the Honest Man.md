Description: |
  "This mummified human hand comes from an honest man punished for a crime he didn't commit, and is dried and hung from a simple twine thong around the neck. The hand's scapegoat origins offer some protection to its wearer. When the wearer of a _hand of the honest man_ is targeted by a curse or a misfortune effect such as a witch's misfortune or evil eye hex, the curse is instead transferred to the hand with no ill effects to the wearer. The hand retains the curse (even if it normally expires after a set duration) until the effect is removed with a _remove curse_ spell or similar effect. A spellcaster receives a +2 bonus on her caster level check to remove a curse stored in a _hand of the honest man_. Removing a _hand of the honest man_ while it holds a curse instantly transfers the curse to its wearer. A _hand of the honest man_ can hold only one curse or effect at a time. If the wearer is targeted by another curse while the hand is currently storing a curse, the new curse takes effect normally. A _hand of the honest man_ has no effect on curses already affecting a creature.
  The wearer of a _hand of the honest man_ is riddled with guilt over any untruths she utters, and takes a –2 penalty on all Bluff checks while wearing the hand."
