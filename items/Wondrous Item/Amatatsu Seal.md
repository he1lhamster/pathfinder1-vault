Description: |
  "This stone statuette of a dragon is one of five royal seals of Minkai, and represents the Amatatsu family's divine right to rule the empire of Minkai. Should no Amatatsus of pure blood be able to take up that charge, however, the Amatatsu Seal can invest the right to rule as an Amatatsu in any number of living humanoid hosts. These Amatatsu scions often experience a series of visions of the past, present, and possible future.The _Amatatsu Seal_ has a daily allotment of 5 charges that it can use to cast the following spells on an Amatatsu scion: _cure serious wounds_, _remove curse_, _remove disease_, or _restoration_. Each casting uses up 1 daily charge. Alternatively, the seal can cast _heal_ on an Amatatsu scion, but doing so expends all 5 charges. Finally, and only at the seal's discretion, it can cast _resurrection_ on an Amatatsu scion, but doing so renders its spellcasting powers useless for a month.The _Amatatsu Seal_ itself radiates strong magic, and those with the proper resources can sense this magic across oceans and continents, allowing it to be tracked across any distance. Originally meant to allow its rightful owners the ability to track it if stolen, this feature makes it dangerous to remove the seal from its _warding box_, for as long as the _warding box_ is open, the oni of the Five Storms can track it. The repercussions of this are detailed in later adventures in the Jade Regent Adventure Path."
Destruction: |
  "To destroy the _Amatatsu Seal_, rightful scions of each of the five royal families of Minkai must, of their own free will, cast their families' seals together into the Well of Demons in the Imperial Shrine in Kasai Harbor."
