Description: |
  "The _life lantern_ appears as a large ankh made of gold with a polished sphere of sapphire fitted into its center. Held in one hand by a living bearer, the _life lantern_ glows with a radiance equal to that of a sunrod. If the carrier is undead, the _life lantern_ instead sheds an area of magical darkness akin to that exuded by a _darkness_ spell.
  The light or darkness exuded by a _life lantern_ enhances certain elements of necromancy. In an area of light generated by a living carrier of a _life lantern_, dying creatures gain a +4 bonus on all Constitution checks to stabilize. More significantly, a body brought back to life via _raise dead_, _resurrection_, or any similar effect does not gain any negative levels upon being brought back, as long as the body is restored while it is illuminated by the _life lantern's_ light. Once per year, the _life lantern_ may be used by a living creature to cast _resurrection_ on a creature by touching the life lantern to a portion of the dead creature's body.
  When the _life lantern_ sheds darkness in the hand of an undead creature, all undead creatures in that area of _darkness_ gain fast healing 5. Once per week, the _life lantern_ may be used by an undead creature to cast _create greater undead_.
  The _life lantern_ also functions as a holy or unholy symbol for a spellcaster who worships a deity who grants access to the domains of Death or Healing, and the spellcaster need not actually have those domains to use the lantern in this way."
Destruction: |
  "If the _life lantern_ is buried in a coffin along with a living creature, it crumbles to dust when the creature dies."
