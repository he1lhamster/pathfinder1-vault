Price: "500 gp"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "faint enchantment"
Description: |
  "A creature that drinks this elixir becomes particularly pliable mentally and emotionally for 10 minutes (Will DC 16 negates). Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks automatically succeed against a pliable creature, except for Diplomacy checks to improve a pliable creature's attitude, which have the normal DC. This does not allow characters to whom the pliable creature is unfriendly or hostile to make requests of the pliable creature using Diplomacy. After 1 minute, the effects of pliability elixir are noticeable with a successful DC 25 Sense Motive check. The GM can apply circumstance bonuses to this check based on factors that make the effect more obvious, such as if the affected creature contradicts itself or agrees to something that doesn't make sense. A vial of _pliability elixir_ appears to be an _elixir of truth_ unless the check made to identify it succeeds by 10 or more."
