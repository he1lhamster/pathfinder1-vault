Slot: "Headband"
Caster level: "8"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "This headband is decorated with feathers from a number of colorful birds. It grants boons to flying magic, and more powerful versions grant the power of flight. The wearer of a _headband of aerial agility +2_ treats his caster level as if it were one level higher when casting spells or creating extracts that grant flight. A _headband of aerial agility +4_ gains the same benefits and, on command, grants the wearer the ability to fly (as the _fly_ spell) three times per day. A _headband of aerial agility +6_ functions like a +4 version, but the headband grants the ability to use _fly_ at will.
  All versions also grant the wearer an enhancement bonus to one mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) of +2, +4, or +6. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the headband is worn. This bonus is chosen when the headband is created and cannot be changed. If the headband grants a bonus to Intelligence, it also grants skill ranks as a _headband of vast intelligence_, usually granting ranks in Fly, Acrobatics, or Knowledge (planes)."
