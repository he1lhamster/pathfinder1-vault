Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "2000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "3"
Aura: "faint conjuration"
Description: |
  "This horn holds 20 doses of black powder for firearms. When a firearm is loaded with black powder directly from this horn, the horn creates a small pocket of air that envelops the gun and allows that shot to be fired underwater or in an area lacking air, such as a vacuum. Once the gun is loaded with powder from the _dry load powder horn_, it retains the pocket of air for 10 minutes or until the firearm is fired, whichever comes first.
  Firing a firearm that has been loaded from this horn underwater still incurs the –2 penalty on attack rolls for every 5 feet of water the bullet passes through, in addition to the normal penalties to range. When a shot loaded from a _dry load powder horn_ results in a firearm explosion while underwater or in an airless environment, that explosion occurs normally."
