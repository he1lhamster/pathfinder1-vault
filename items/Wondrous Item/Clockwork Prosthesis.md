  "Accidents are common in the City of Smog, and in a place where healing magic is distrusted at best and haphazard at worst, amputation is often the only remedy for a mangled hand or smashed leg.

Only humanoid creatures can equip themselves with _clockwork prostheses_, which must be installed by a trained prosthesis merchant. As a _clockwork prosthesis_ is installed (a process that takes no less than 1 hour), the bearer must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or the prosthesis doesn't take hold. Either way, the bearer takes 2 points of Constitution damage from the surgery. _Clockwork prostheses_ commonly come in two types—arms and legs.
  _Clockwork Arm_: A _clockwork arm_ allows its bearer to lift up to 1-1/2 times his maximum load over his head. A humanoid with two _clockwork arms_ can lift up to twice his maximum load over his head. In addition, a _clockwork arm_ allows its bearer to deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike and provides a +10 bonus to its bearer's CMD against attempts to disarm a weapon held in that hand. For the appropriate price, a clockwork arm can be enchanted with any weapon special ability so long as the ability can be applied to unarmed attacks.
  _Clockwork Leg_: A _clockwork leg_ allows its bearer to lift up to 2-1/2 times his maximum load off the ground (instead of double). A humanoid with two _clockwork legs_ can lift up to 3 times his maximum load off the ground and stagger around with it. In addition, each installed _clockwork leg_ grants its bearer a +4 bonus to CMD against trip and bull rush attempts.
  The _clockwork prostheses_ detailed here are only the most common types of _clockwork prostheses_. Other, more specialized _clockwork prostheses_ capable of transforming into firearms, pinning opponents, and even channeling magical energy are also rumored to exist."

### Description

Accidents are common in the City of Smog, and in a place where healing magic is distrusted at best and haphazard at worst, amputation is often the only remedy for a mangled hand or smashed leg. For those who can afford them, clockwork prostheses —miraculous metallic extremities fused with a small amount of primal magic—offer an elegant solution to missing limbs.

Once purchased, a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Clockwork Prosthesis|clockwork prosthesis]]_ is attached to the area where a limb once was—a prosthesis can't be added in addition to an already existing limb. Only humanoid creatures can equip themselves with clockwork prostheses, which must be installed by a trained prosthesis merchant. As a _clockwork prosthesis_ is installed (a process that takes no less than 1 hour), the bearer must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or the prosthesis doesn't take hold. Either way, the bearer takes 2 points of Constitution damage from the surgery. Clockwork prostheses commonly come in two types—arms and legs.

_[[items/Wondrous Item/Clockwork Arm|Clockwork Arm]]_: A _clockwork arm_ allows its bearer to lift up to 1-1/2 times his maximum load over his head. A humanoid with two clockwork arms can lift up to twice his maximum load over his head. In addition, a _clockwork arm_ allows its bearer to deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike and provides a +10 bonus to its bearer's CMD against attempts to disarm a weapon held in that hand. For the appropriate price, a _clockwork arm_ can be enchanted with any weapon special ability so long as the ability can be applied to unarmed attacks.

Clockwork Leg: A clockwork leg allows its bearer to lift up to 2-1/2 times his maximum load off the ground (instead of double). A humanoid with two clockwork legs can lift up to 3 times his maximum load off the ground and stagger around with it. In addition, each installed clockwork leg grants its bearer a +4 bonus to CMD against _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ and bull rush attempts.

The clockwork prostheses detailed here are only the most common types of clockwork prostheses. Other, more specialized clockwork prostheses capable of transforming into firearms, pinning opponents, and even _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Channeling|channeling]]_ magical energy are also rumored to exist.
