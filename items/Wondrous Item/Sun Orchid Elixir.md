Description: |
  "Thuvia's _sun orchid elixir_ is a nearly perfect solution for those who seek eternal life. A single dose of _sun orchid elixir_ cannot stop the aging process, but it does the next-best thing—it restores youth. A creature that drinks the elixir is restored to its starting age as a young adult. The drinker's new age is randomly determined using Table 7–1 on page 169 of the _Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook_. All penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution the drinker may have suffered as a result of advanced age are removed, but all bonuses to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma that result from advanced age remain (although as the character ages again into middle age and beyond, he does not gain any of these bonuses a second time).
  Vanity-seekers go to nearly any length to acquire the elixir, resorting to bribery, extortion, and murder. To curtail such troubles in the land of its creation, the use of the elixir is outlawed in Thuvia (except by the formula's creator). Each vial of _sun orchid elixir_ requires six mature sun orchids and 1 month's time to ferment, although the exact formula used is a secret known only to the denizen of Alchemist's Keep in Thuvia. Prices for a dose of the elixir vary wildly since the elixir is sold at auction, but no dose has ever sold for less than 50,000 gp."
Destruction: |
  "A dose of _sun orchid elixir_ is simple to destroy—merely pouring the elixir out and allowing the fluid to evaporate or be absorbed into the ground is enough to ruin it, as is mixing it with any other fluid or solvent. Of course, if word gets out of this fantastic waste of powerful magic, any number of enraged or scandalized organizations might seek out the character responsible for the elixir's waste to extract bloody vengeance."
