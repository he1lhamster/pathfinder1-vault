  "This is the most common form of scrying device, a crystal sphere about 6 inches in diameter. So well-known are these items that many so-called oracles or fortune-tellers use similar appearing (but completely nonmagical) replicas of these items to ply their trades. A character can use a magical crystal ball to see over virtually any distance or into other planes of existence, as with the spell _scrying_ (Will DC 16 negates). A crystal ball can be used multiple times per day, but the DC to resist its power decreases by 1 for each additional use. Certain crystal balls have additional powers that can be used through the crystal ball on the target viewed.
