Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "7200 gp"
Weight: "4 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "6"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "A _folding boat_ looks like a small wooden box about 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep when it is inactive. In this mode, it can be used to store items just like any other box. Yet when the proper command word is given, the box unfolds itself rapidly in the space of a single round to form a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet in depth. A second command word causes it to unfold even further into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The _folding boat_ cannot unfold if there isn't enough open space for it to occupy once unfolded. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside the boat or ship.
  In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. In its larger form, the boat has a deck, single rowing seats, five sets of oars, a rudder, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The boat can hold four people comfortably, while the ship carries 15 with ease.
  A third word of command causes the boat or ship to fold itself into a box once again, but only when it is unoccupied."

### Description

A _[[items/Wondrous Item/Folding Boat|folding boat]]_ looks like a small wooden box about 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep when it is inactive. In this mode, it can be used to store items just like any other box. Yet when the proper _[[spells/Command|command]]_ word is given, the box unfolds itself rapidly in the space of a single round to form a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet in depth. A second _command_ word causes it to unfold even further into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The _folding boat_ cannot unfold if there isn't enough open space for it to occupy once unfolded. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside the boat or ship.

In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. In its larger form, the boat has a deck, single rowing seats, five sets of oars, a rudder, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The boat can hold four people comfortably, while the ship carries 15 with ease.

A third word of _command_ causes the boat or ship to fold itself into a box once again, but only when it is unoccupied.
