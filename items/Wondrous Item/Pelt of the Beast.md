### Description

These lustrous animal pelts are particularly treasured among Ulfen barbarians. While any humanoid creature can don and use such pelts, their powers are vastly enhanced for skinwalkers. All pelts of the beast grant the following powers:

* A bite attack that deals damage appropriate to the wearer's size. If the wearer already has a bite attack, the critical threat range of this attack doubles. This does not stack with other magical effects that increase the threat range of a natural weapon.
* _[[spells/Speak with Animals|Speak with animals]]_ 1/day. If the wearer can already use _speak with animals_ as a spell-like ability, she may do so at will.
* The wearer may take the form of the animal from which the pelt came three times per day as if using _[[spells/Beast Shape I|beast shape I]]_. In addition, if the wearer is a _[[monsters/Skinwalker|skinwalker]]_, her _[[universal monster rules/Change Shape|change shape]]_ ability is enhanced so that she may gain an additional bestial feature when taking her bestial form, selectable from the _skinwalker_ heritage tied to the animal from which the pelt came. For instance, a werewolf-kin wearing a bear _[[items/Wondrous Item/Pelt of the Beast|pelt of the beast]]_ could use her _change shape_ ability to gain a _[[universal monster rules/Climb|climb]]_ speed from the pelt's bestial features (identical to the set listed for werebear-kin) in addition to _[[spells/Darkvision|darkvision]]_ from her set of werewolf-kin bestial features. Feats or abilities that affect how many bestial features the _skinwalker_ may gain at a single time stack with this ability.
