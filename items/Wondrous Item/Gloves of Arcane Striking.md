### Description

These soft leather gloves are decorated with even rows of mithral rivets. Only a spellcaster with the _[[feats/Arcane Strike|Arcane Strike]]_ feat can activate their abilities. These abilities are as follows.

* When the wearer uses the aid another action to improve an ally's attack roll, the ally adds the wearer's _Arcane Strike_ damage bonus to its damage roll for that attack.
* When the wearer makes an attack using _Arcane Strike_ and hits, enemies adjacent to the target take damage equal to the wearer's _Arcane Strike_ damage bonus. This damage is of the same type as the weapon's damage (bludgeoning, piercing, and so on).
* When the wearer uses the aid another action to improve an ally's Armor Class, the ally also adds the wearer's _Arcane Strike_ damage bonus to his AC against the opponent.
