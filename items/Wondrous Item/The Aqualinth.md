Aura: "strong universal"
Description: |
  "A strange statue of some unknown dark material resembling unnaturally slippery stone, this idol is carved in the shape of something at once unrecognizable and terrifyingly organic, and possesses a number of unique abilities when touching liquid.
  _Geyser_: If four or more levels' worth of spells are cast upon the _Aqualinth_, the artifact is capable of causing the water surrounding it to purify and multiply, generating thousands of gallons of water. At the same time, it creates an effect mimicking _reverse gravity_ upon the water, causing it to shoot up in a geyser capable of reaching a thousand feet high. Moments later, the effect passes; the water comes crashing down, and can be captured or diverted in the process, though the water level of the original supply remains unchanged.
  _Bath of the God-Kings_: Bathing in a pool infested by the Aqualinth instantly refreshes the bather, removing any fatigued or exhausted conditions. In addition, the bather is treated as though he were wearing a _ring of sustenance_ for the next 4 months. Regular bathing for 56 days results in a +1 increase to a single ability score of the bather's choice—a creature can receive this bonus only once, but can continue to receive the other benefits of bathing in the pool.
  _Liquid Ones_: Anyone who spies her own reflection in a pool infested by the _Aqualinth_ and who is not completely loyal to the Four Pharaohs of Ascension is treated as though she had gazed into the reflective surface of a _mirror of opposition_. The duplicates created by the _Aqualinth_ are not truly identical to their originals. A duplicate has vulnerability to fire, losing any fire resistance or immunity the original may have, and also gains the water subtype. A duplicate can be distinguished from the original with a DC 30 Perception check, as the duplicate has a faint watery texture to its skin.
  _Whispering Water_: Possessed of a malign and alien intellect, the _Aqualinth_ has an unknown agenda of its own, and is capable of casting _suggestion_ (save DC 31) upon anyone who drinks at least half a gallon of water it has touched or produced."
Destruction: |
  "The _Aqualinth_ may be evaporated into nothingness by transporting it to the heart of a sun or star."
