  "This cloak is usually made of wool, although it can be made of leather. A _detect poison_ spell can reveal the presence of poison in the cloak's fabric.

  Once donned, a _poisonous cloak_ can be removed only with a _remove curse_ spell; doing this destroys the magical property of the cloak. If a _neutralize poison_ spell is then used, it is possible to revive a dead victim with a _raise dead_ or _resurrection_ spell."
