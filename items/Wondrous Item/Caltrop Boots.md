These caltrops fill each square the wearer moves into during that round. Any creature, including the wearer, occupying or who steps into one of these squares suffers the normal effects of coming into contact with caltrops (_Core Rulebook_ 155). Once produced, these caltrops remain in existence until removed from their square, at which point they immediately disappear. The shoes can be used for 10 rounds per day. These rounds need not be consecutive."
