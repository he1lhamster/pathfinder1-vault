Price: "–"
Weight: "4 lbs."
Slot: "Head"
Caster level: "20"
Aura: "strong enchantment, strong illusion, strong necromancy"
Description: |
  "The eponymous fangs set into this jeweled golden circlet are those of the dragon Kazavon. The crown grants its wearer a +6 enhancement bonus to her Constitution and Charisma scores, as well as regeneration 20. Only a blade capable of destroying the crown, like Serithtial, can bypass this regeneration. The wearer gains the personal benefits of _foresight_, while the crown itself can cast each of the following spells three times per day: _alter self_, _dominate person_ (DC 17), _major image_ (DC 17), _mirror image_, and _mislead_ (DC 19).
  Queen Ileosa and this crown are bound together, and she retains its bonuses to her ability scores and regeneration even if she isn't wearing the crown, regardless of the distance between the two. She prefers to wear the crown because that allows it to use its spells in her defense—and because of her vanity and pride."
Destruction: |
  "The _Crown of Fangs_ is destroyed if struck (while unattended) by a holy sword forged by a once-mortal god—the blade _Serithtial_ is one such blade."
