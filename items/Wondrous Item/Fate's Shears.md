Description: |
  "The blades of these antique scissors are engraved with images of an infant, a child, an adult, and an elder (female images on one blade, male images on the other). The blades are permanently coated with _salve of slipperiness_ and therefore adhesives do not stick to them, making them especially suitable for cutting through sticky things (such as spiderwebs, cave fisher filaments, and so on). If used in combat, the shears function as a masterwork dagger. Once per day as an immediate action, the bearer can point the shears at a creature within 30 feet and force that creature to reroll its most recent attack, check, or save, and use the result of the second roll; the bearer is staggered on her next turn after using this ability. In addition, the bearer can use _deathwatch_ once per day."
