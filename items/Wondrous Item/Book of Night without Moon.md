Description: |
  "This black grimoire's pages are mostly blank, but a few contain rough watercolor silhouettes. The _Book of Night without Moon_ is a repository for trapped shadows. To sever a shadow from its owner and add it to the book, the user must speak a command word and snap the book shut on the shadow. The shadow must be very still when it is severed, so the victim must be either willing or helpless. The book has 40 pages; a shadow takes up a number of pages equal to the Hit Dice of the creature that cast it.
  A creature whose shadow is stolen must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or be sickened by a nameless melancholy until its shadow is returned (in the meantime, the creature casts no shadow). Losing its shadow has no adverse effect on a creature that cannot be sickened. A _remove curse_ spell cast on the creature ends the effect and retrieves the shadow from the book.
  As a standard action, the book's bearer may release a shadow from the book, conjuring an illusory duplicate of the shadow's owner as if with the spell _shadow conjuration_ (DC 18 Will save to recognize that the conjuration is an illusion). The shadow is intelligent and can follow complex commands, but cannot speak and lacks the memories or personality of the creature that cast it. The shadow serves the character who released it for 1 hour or until destroyed, whichever comes first. The shadow then returns instantly and permanently to its original owner, wherever he or she may be. It cannot be commanded to return to the book and cannot be stolen again. The book's magic can sustain up to five active shadows at a time.
  A _Book of Night without Moon_ purchased or found as treasure contains 2d6 shadows, chosen by the GM."

### Description

This black grimoire's pages are mostly blank, but a few contain rough watercolor silhouettes. The _[[items/Wondrous Item/Book of Night without Moon|Book of Night without Moon]]_ is a repository for trapped shadows. To sever a _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|shadow]]_ from its owner and add it to the book, the user must speak a _[[spells/Command|command]]_ word and snap the book shut on the _shadow_. The _shadow_ must be very still when it is severed, so the victim must be either willing or _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_. The book has 40 pages; a _shadow_ takes up a number of pages equal to the Hit Dice of the creature that cast it.

A creature whose _shadow_ is stolen must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or be _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ by a nameless melancholy until its _shadow_ is returned (in the meantime, the creature casts no _shadow_). Losing its _shadow_ has no adverse effect on a creature that cannot be _sickened_. A _[[spells/Remove Curse|remove curse]]_ spell cast on the creature ends the effect and retrieves the _shadow_ from the book.

As a standard action, the book's bearer may release a _shadow_ from the book, conjuring an illusory duplicate of the _shadow_'s owner as if with the spell _[[spells/Shadow Conjuration|shadow conjuration]]_ (DC 18 Will save to recognize that the conjuration is an illusion). The _shadow_ is intelligent and can follow complex commands, but cannot speak and lacks the memories or personality of the creature that cast it. The _shadow_ serves the character who released it for 1 hour or until destroyed, whichever comes first. The _shadow_ then returns instantly and permanently to its original owner, wherever he or she may be. It cannot be commanded to return to the book and cannot be stolen again. The book's magic can sustain up to five active shadows at a time.
