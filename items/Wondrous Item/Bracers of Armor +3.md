Description: |
  "These items appear to be wrist or arm guards, sometimes etched with symbols of protection or depictions of vigilant-looking animals. _Bracers of armor_ surround the wearer with an invisible but tangible field of force, granting him an armor bonus of +1 to +8, just as though he were wearing armor. Both _bracers of armor_ must be worn for the magic to be effective.
  Alternatively, _bracers of armor_ can be enchanted with armor special abilities. See Table 3–3: Armor Special Abilities for a list of abilities. Special abilities usually count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of an item, but do not improve AC. _Bracers of armor_ cannot have a modified bonus (armor bonus plus armor special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +8. _Bracers of armor_ must have at least a +1 armor bonus to grant an armor special ability. Bracers of armor cannot have any armor special abilities that add a flat gp amount to their cost. _Bracers of armor_ and ordinary armor do not stack. If the wearer receives a larger armor bonus from another source, the _bracers of armor_ cease functioning and do not grant their armor bonus or their armor special abilities. If the _bracers of armor_ grant a larger armor bonus, the other source of armor ceases functioning."
