Title: "Dryad's Song"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "–"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "20"
Aura: "strong conjuration, strong transmutation"
Description: |
  "The gleaming, gold scepter bears elegant boughs and leaves, blooming into a miniature, flowered treetop at one end. The scepter's rod has four slots, onto which four large rings can be slotted. Each ring is engraved with a phrase in Sylvan, and can be placed upon or removed from the scepter as a standard action.
  **Ring 1**: "Daughters of the Fangwood green."
  **Ring 2**: "Hear my ardent call."
  **Ring 3**: "Discharge now to oaths long sworn."
  **Ring 4**: "For Accressiel glory, live or fall."
  _Dryad's Song_ grants anyone holding it a +5 morale bonus on all Diplomacy and Intimidate skill checks against fey that live within Fangwood Forest. _Dryad's Song_ allows its wielder to cast _diminish plants_, _entangle_, _plant growth_, and _wood shape_ at will, though these spells affect plants only within Fangwood Forest. Up to three times each day, by reciting the poem on its rings as a full-round action, _Dryad's Song_ allows its wielder to either summon 40 HD worth of dryads, nymphs, and satyrs, or allows its wielder and up to 19 additional Medium or smaller creatures to teleport anywhere within the Fangwood Forest as if they were very familiar with the destination. Summoned fey remain for 20 hours, can be dismissed at will, and are not obligated to obey the wielder's command; dryads summoned by _Dryad's Song_ lose their tree dependence weakness while they serve on the wielder's behalf. Unlike the corrupted version of the artifact, the fully restored _Dryad's Song_ grants access to its magic whether its various rings are slotted into the scepter or not. Just like the corrupted version, _Dryad's Song_ can purge the Darkblight from a living creature within 60 feet as a full-round action.
  A ring from the scepter may be gifted to another person. The ring can be worn as a bracelet or on a necklace (occupying the appropriate magic item slot), and grants a +3 resistance bonus on its wearer's saving throws. Once per day, the ring can be used to contact the wielder of _Dryad's Song_ via _sending_.
  The glaistig Gendowyn maintains a powerful connection to the artifact, and can summon _Dryad's Song_ to her hand as a standard action."
Destruction: |
  "_Dryad's Song_ crumbles into ash if it is wholly submerged in a mixture of glaistig blood and a traitor's tears of regret."
