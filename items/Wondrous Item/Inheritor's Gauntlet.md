Title: "Inheritor's Gauntlet"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "2700 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Hands"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "faint evocation"
Description: |
  "This metal gauntlet is the sort appropriate for wearing with chainmail, though versions suited for leather or full plate exist. Affixed to the wrist is a white cloth with a longsword embroidered in gold thread. Once per day, the wearer can speak a command word to give a weapon the wearer holds in that hand (or the gauntlet itself) a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls for 1 minute. An _Inheritor's gauntlet_ uses up the wearer's entire hands slot; the wearer can not use another item (even another _Inheritor's gauntlet_) that also uses the hands slot, though a matching nonmagical gauntlet is often worn on the other hand.
  If Iomedae is the wearer's patron, the gauntlet lets the wearer use any sword he holds in that hand as a holy symbol. Once per day, the wearer can speak a command word and give any sword he holds the powers of an _evil outsider-bane_ weapon for 1 minute; this effect ends if the wearer drops the sword or removes the gauntlet. If the wearer uses a finger to draw Iomedae's symbol on any solid surface, the symbol glows as brightly as a candle for 1 hour or until the wearer draws the symbol elsewhere (whichever comes first)."

### Description

This metal _[[items/Weapon/Gauntlet|gauntlet]]_ is the sort appropriate for wearing with _[[items/Armor/Chainmail|chainmail]]_, though versions suited for leather or _[[items/Armor/Full plate|full plate]]_ exist. Affixed to the wrist is a white cloth with a _[[items/Weapon/Longsword|longsword]]_ embroidered in gold thread. Once per day, the wearer can speak a _[[spells/Command|command]]_ word to give a weapon the wearer holds in that hand (or the _gauntlet_ itself) a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls for 1 minute. An _[[items/Wondrous Item/Inheritor's Gauntlet|Inheritor's gauntlet]]_ uses up the wearer's entire hands slot; the wearer can not use another item (even another _Inheritor's gauntlet_) that also uses the hands slot, though a matching nonmagical _gauntlet_ is often worn on the other hand.

If Iomedae is the wearer's patron, the _gauntlet_ lets the wearer use any sword he holds in that hand as a holy symbol. Once per day, the wearer can speak a _command_ word and give any sword he holds the powers of an evil outsider-bane weapon for 1 minute; this effect ends if the wearer drops the sword or removes the _gauntlet_. If the wearer uses a finger to draw Iomedae's symbol on any solid surface, the symbol glows as brightly as a _[[items/Mundane/Candle|candle]]_ for 1 hour or until the wearer draws the symbol elsewhere (whichever comes first).
