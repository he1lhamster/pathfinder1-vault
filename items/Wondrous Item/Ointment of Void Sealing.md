Description: |
  "_Ointment of void sealing_ comes in a 4-gallon tub, typically made out of brass or some other durable metal. When a Medium or smaller character dunks his head into the tub of sticky, viscous goo as a standard action, the ointment flows over and around him with surprising alacrity until it has coated him in a thin but flexible layer that looks like translucent amber. _Ointment of void sealing_ creates a perfect seal around the user, protecting him from the extreme cold and vacuum of outer space, and provides breathable air for the user, as _planetary adaptation_ (see page 28). After 3 hours, a coating of _ointment of void sealing_ deteriorates and its effects end. A newly created tub of _ointment of void sealing_ contains enough ointment to cover four Medium creatures. Large creatures require 2 doses to gain the benefits of the ointment, while two Small creatures can share a single dose between them."
