  "This belt-and-scabbard set is decorated with golden depictions of garudas. The scabbard automatically reshapes itself to fit the weapon that the wielder is currently using. If the wielder is not using a weapon that would fit into a scabbard, as a free action the wielder can command the _khangarad scabbard_ to take the shape of any weapon with which she has proficiency.
  Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can speak the scabbard's command word to blast nearby creatures with gale-force winds. As part of activating the scabbard, the wielder can attempt a special trip combat maneuver check against all creatures within 10 feet using her normal CMB; this does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures whose CMD is lower than the result are tripped. The wielder is not knocked down if the trip attempt fails by 10 or more."
