Description: |
  "This medallion hangs on a leather cord, a silver disc inscribed with the Sihedron. These medallions were given to favored agents of the runelords; the medallions granted some minor benefits to the wearers, but also allowed the runelords to use the wearer as proxies. By concentrating on a scrying device (such as a _runewell_), a runelord can sense the world through the _Sihedron medallion_ wearer's senses, and could speak through her voice—provided the runelord knows of the existence of the medallion and the fact that it is being worn. Thus, Karzoug cannot use the medallion while it's worn by Nualia in Chapter One, as she is unknown to him, but once the PCs come to his attention later in the campaign, that may well change. See page 324 for more details on the ramifications of wearing a _Sihedron medallion_ in Xin-Shalast.
  While worn, a _Sihedron medallion_ grants its wearer a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. Once per day, as a free action, it may be commanded to bestow the effects of _false life_ on the wearer. Placed on the neck of a dead body, a _Sihedron medallion_ preserves the body indefinitely via a gentle repose effect."

This medallion hangs on a leather cord, a silver disc inscribed with the _[[items/Wondrous Item/Sihedron|Sihedron]]_. These medallions were given to favored agents of the runelords; the medallions granted some minor benefits to the wearers, but also allowed the runelords to use the wearer as proxies. By concentrating on a _[[spells/Scrying|scrying]]_ device (such as a runewell), a runelord can sense the world through the _[[items/Wondrous Item/Sihedron Medallion|Sihedron medallion]]_ wearer's senses, and could speak through her voice—provided the runelord knows of the existence of the medallion and the fact that it is being worn. Thus, Karzoug cannot use the medallion while it's worn by Nualia in Chapter One, as she is _[[monsters/Unknown|unknown]]_ to him, but once the PCs come to his attention later in the campaign, that may well change.
