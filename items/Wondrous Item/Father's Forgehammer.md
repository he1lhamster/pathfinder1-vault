Description: |
  "This iron blacksmith's hammer bears designs of Torag's holy symbol; it is not designed for combat, but the bearer can use it as a Medium light hammer. Once per day, the bearer can strike the hammer hard against a weapon to target that weapon with _magic weapon_. The owner gains a +2 competence bonus on all smithing (armorsmithing, blacksmithing, weaponsmithing, and so on) skill checks made when crafting with the _forgehammer_.
  If Torag is the owner's patron, once per day the owner can strike the hammer against another character's armor or shield to cast _shield other_ on that character. If the owner can craft magic weapons or armor and uses the _forgehammer_ during the crafting, the total time to craft the item is decreased by 25% (minimum 1 day). This does not reduce the cost to create the item. A particular _forgehammer_ can aid in only one item's crafting at a time."
