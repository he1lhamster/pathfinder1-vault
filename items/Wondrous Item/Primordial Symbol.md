Weight: "1 lb."

Caster level: "20"
Aura: "strong abjuration"
Description: |
  "Its origin lost in the infinite expanse of time, a _primordial symbol_ is a polished stone bearing a mystic sign that resembles a lopsided, twobarred cross. When held forth and invoked by a bearer who is able to cast psychic spells or has the Psychic Sensitivity feat, a _primordial symbol_ flares with an invisible flash in a 100-foot-radius burst, which has the following effects on those in range.
  Other creatures and objects within the area are otherwise unharmed. When the symbol is activated, its wielder takes 2d6 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma damage, rolled separately for each ability. The _primordial symbol_ then collapses in on itself and vanishes, only to reappear unharmed in a distant land or world."
Destruction: |
  "Though seemingly destroyed by activation, the eldritch potential bound into a _primordial symbol_ persists and recreates the symbol elsewhere in the multiverse. To permanently destroy the artifact, the _primordial symbol_ must be brought to a realm of pure chaos at the unformed edges of the Outer Planes and melted in the primal energy of creation."

### Description

Its origin lost in the infinite expanse of time, a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Primordial Symbol|primordial symbol]]_ is a polished stone bearing a mystic sign that resembles a lopsided, twobarred cross. When held forth and invoked by a bearer who is able to cast _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ spells or has the _[[feats/Psychic Sensitivity|Psychic Sensitivity]]_ feat, a _primordial symbol_ flares with an _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ flash in a 100-foot-radius burst, which has the following effects on those in range.

* Creatures with 40 Hit Dice or fewer with the extraplanar subtype are returned to their home planes as though by the _[[spells/Banishment|banishment]]_ spell, regardless of _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ and with no save permitted. This includes extraplanar entities possessing other creatures.
* Any non-extraplanar entities possessing other creatures or extraplanar entities with more than 40 Hit Dice possessing other creatures are driven out of their hosts.
* All eidolons, _[[classes/Medium|medium]]_ spirits, and phantoms are dismissed.
* All _psychic_ spells in the area are dispelled as though by greater _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_, with no caster level check required.
