Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "–"
Weight: "0.5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "20"
Aura: "strong abjuration"
Description: |
  "When the final fragment of the Kenabres _wardstone_ shatters, a few tiny shards of the stone remain behind. The magic remaining in these fragments is fleeting, usable only once before the shard becomes an inert sliver of stone. As a standard action, a _wardstone shard_ may be rubbed along a weapon or a suit of armor to transfer the shard's magic to the weapon or armor for 1 day.
  _Weapon_: A weapon enhanced by a wardstone shard gains the evil outsider bane quality, and is treated as being made of cold iron and as a good weapon for the purposes of overcoming a demon's damage reduction. The shard cannot be used to enhance ammunition in this manner, but can be used to enhance a weapon that fires ammunition; doing so causes the weapon to impart these qualities to the ammunition as it is fired.
  _Armor_: A suit of armor enhanced by a _wardstone shard_ gains the spell resistance (13) armor special ability, but only against evil outsiders. Against demons, this spell resistance increases to 17. A nonmagical suit of armor also gains a +1 enhancement bonus as well."
Destruction: |
  "A _wardstone shard_ may be destroyed by simply crushing it—a shard has hardness 16 and 12 hit points."
