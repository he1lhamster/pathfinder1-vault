  "The dark cosmetic in this small decorative tube is made from finely ground minerals. Favored by Osirian men and women alike, nonmagical kohl is applied around the eyes and is used to reduce the glare from the desert sun, and cosmetically to cause the whites of the wearer's eyes to stand out distinctly.
  When applied to the eyes, _kohl of uncanny discernment_ grants its wearer low-light vision and a +2 competence bonus on Perception checks. If the wearer already has low-light vision, the kohl doubles the distance the wearer can see.
