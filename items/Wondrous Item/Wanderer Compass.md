Description: |
  "This brass compass's needle appears to be of a weird material, one that shimmers silver and blue. When held in hand in a magic-warped region such as the Mana Wastes, a _wanderer compass_ points toward the nearest pocket of magical non-interference-an area where there is little or no chance of spellcasting being warped by primal magic. This effect has a range of 1 mile. If no pockets of non-interference are within range, the compass's needle slowly spins clockwise. If the bearer of a _wanderer compass_ is already within a pocket of non-interference, the compass needle spins counter-clockwise."
