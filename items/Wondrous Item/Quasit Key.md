Title: "Quasit Key"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "70000 gp"
Weight: "12 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "13"
Aura: "strong conjuration"
Description: |
  "A _quasit key_ appears as a glass jar filled with preserving fluids in which a pickled quasit floats. Each _quasit key_ is attuned to a specific location in the Abyss when created, and as long as it is carried (even if it's carried in an extradimensional space), the carrier can use _plane shift_ to transport himself and up to eight other creatures that are joining hands to that location (the _quasit key_ found in this adventure is keyed to area **C1** of Aponavicius's lair). If used in the Abyss, the _quasit key_ instead uses _plane shift_ to transport its user back to wherever the key was last used to travel to its linked location. Until a _quasit key_ is used to travel to its linked Abyssal location, it has nowhere to go from the Abyss itself and does not function while in the Abyss. A _quasit key_ functions only twice per day."
