  "This crystalline carving looks like a hand-sized tree leaf. It is usually worn around the neck on a strap so it is within easy reach, but can be affixed to a belt or clothing just like a badge. While falling, the bearer can snap and destroy the _snapleaf_ as an immediate action to gain the benefits of _feather fall_ and _invisibility_. The duration of the two effects work independently; ending one early does not affect the other. The item cannot be activated to provide just one of these two effects; they are always activated simultaneously."
