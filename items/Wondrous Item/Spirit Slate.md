  "This simple chalkboard consists of a book-sized wooden frame surrounding a thin, rectangular slice of flat black slate. Though mediums typically use mundane slates to demonstrate automatic writing, this magical version can obtain answers to specific questions regarding a dead creature if the user has access to at least a fragment of bone from the deceased's body. Once the user places a bone fragment upon the slate, that fragment animates and begins scribbling answers to the following four questions on the slate's surface.
  These answers always appear in a language the user can read, even if the creature could not speak that or any language. The device can be used up to 3 times per day."

### Description

This simple _[[items/Mundane/Chalkboard|chalkboard]]_ consists of a book-sized wooden frame surrounding a thin, rectangular slice of flat black slate. Though mediums typically use mundane slates to demonstrate automatic writing, this magical version can obtain answers to specific questions regarding a dead creature if the user has access to at least a fragment of bone from the deceased's body. Once the user places a bone fragment upon the slate, that fragment animates and begins scribbling answers to the following four questions on the slate's surface.

* Who were you? (The name by which the creature was most commonly known.)
* What were you? (The creature's gender, race, profession/ role.)
* How did you die? (A brief outline of the events that caused the creature's death, to the creature's best knowledge.)
* When did you die? (To the most specific time the creature can place its death.)
