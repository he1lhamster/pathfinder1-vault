  "Every _mute marionette_ appears as a hag with its lips sewn shut.

If the doll's owner is within 30 feet of one or more creatures of the attuned type, the owner can shake the doll as a standard action. Creatures of the attuned type must attempt a DC 11 Will save; on a failure, for the next hour, affected creatures have a 10% chance of failing to cast spells or spell-like abilities as long as they remain within 30 feet of the doll. Regardless of the result of its save, a creature cannot be targeted by a _mute marionette_ more than once per 24 hours. Once per day, a _mute marionette_ can be presented forcefully to cast _confusion_ (DC 16) at an area within 170 feet, affecting all creatures of the attuned type in a 15-foot-radius burst."
