Description: |
  "This vial contains what appears to be ordinary ink. However, when a command word is uttered and then an individual uses the ink to write something, the ink "stores" that person's handwriting style, and can then be used to duplicate it, allowing the creation of a nearly perfect forgery. For example, if a noble was provided the ink for the purpose of signing a writ of arrest, the next person to use the ink could activate its power and scribe a pardon in the exact handwriting of the noble. Such a falsified document perfectly matches the stored handwriting, thus granting a +20 bonus on Linguistics checks to create a forgery (which doesn't stack with any bonus from possessing an original copy of the handwriting in question). At the GM's discretion, if the person attempting to detect the forgery doesn't have the appropriate knowledge to look for other clues, such as the type of paper used, the seal, the method of delivery, or the phrasing, the check to detect the forgery automatically fails. The individual being mimicked must inscribe something legible. Doodling, drawing, or random scratching doesn't convey the handwriting style, though simple lists, signatures, or mathematical computations do. The ink can't produce magical writing (spellbook pages or scrolls) unless the forger has the ability to create such writing and is attempting to do so, in which case the magical inscription appears in the mimicked person's handwriting and must be deciphered by _read magic_ as normal. The vial contains enough _ink of mimicry_ to create 10 pages of forged text. Text written using the ink in the process of storing the writer's handwriting style doesn't count toward the limit."

### Description

This _[[items/Mundane/Vial|vial]]_ contains what appears to be ordinary _[[items/Mundane/Ink|ink]]_. However, when a _[[spells/Command|command]]_ word is uttered and then an individual uses the _ink_ to write something, the _ink_ "stores" that person's handwriting style, and can then be used to duplicate it, allowing the creation of a nearly perfect forgery. For example, if a noble was provided the _ink_ for the purpose of signing a writ of arrest, the next person to use the _ink_ could activate its power and scribe a pardon in the exact handwriting of the noble. Such a falsified document perfectly matches the stored handwriting, thus granting a +20 bonus on Linguistics checks to create a forgery (which doesn't stack with any bonus from possessing an original copy of the handwriting in question).
