Title: "Dryad's Song (Corrupted)"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "–"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "20"
Aura: "strong necromancy, strong transmutation"
Description: |
  "This tarnished gold scepter's ends are shaped into sickly, withered-looking leaves. The scepter's rod has four slots, into which four large rings can be placed. Each ring is engraved with a phrase in Abyssal, and can be placed upon or removed from the scepter as a standard action.
  **Ring 1**: "Princess of the Blasted Heath."
  **Ring 2**: "Shall stand proud to station earned."
  **Ring 3**: "Moss and rot shall grow unchecked."
  **Ring 4**: "‘Til all hands bear the sin they've earned."
  The corrupted _Dryad's Song_ grants some limited control over the Darkblight. With a single ring, the bearer can cast entangle and _wood shape_ each 3/day. With two rings, the bearer can also cast _blight_, _diminish plants_, _plant growth_, and _tree stride_ each 1/day. With three rings, the bearer can also cast _black tentacles_ 1/day, animating the fungal matter in the area in lieu of creating extradimensional tendrils. With all four rings, the bearer can recite the full poem on the scepter as a full-round action to purge a single creature within 60 feet of the Darkblight's taint, as if she had successfully cast _remove curse_ and _remove disease_ —even removing the blighted fey template from a target creature (unwilling fey can resist this effect with a successful DC 28 Will save). All of these spell-like abilities affect only fungus and plants infected with the Darkblight.
  A single ring on its own maintains some control over the Darkblight—reading a ring's phrase as a standard action grants the creature holding it and up to nine other creatures she can see immunity to Darkblight infestation for 1 hour. A single ring does nothing to reverse the effects of Darkblight already infesting a creature."
Destruction: |
  "If the blighted dryad Arlantia is killed, _Dryad's Song_ slowly reverts to its original state."
