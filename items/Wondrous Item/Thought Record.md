Description: |
  "Though this tube resembles a simple copper pipe, its exotic metal reshapes the flow of time itself. A _thought record_ measures 1 foot in length, and despite its light weight, it resists sudden acceleration as if it were a heavy, massive tree trunk. Intricate patterns are etched inside the tube, constantly shifting into new configurations that never repeat. _Thought records_ store and replay memories, absorbing the entirety of a person's experience in an instant. These memories remain in the _thought record_ indefinitely and can't be altered, though subsequent recordings from the same individual can be added. _Thought records_ absorb such imprints unpredictably, with no indication of when the artifact will trigger or how to activate it deliberately. When the _thought record_ records a life, its etched metal surface fades, appearing instead as a tiny window into a cosmic starscape. No known limit exists as to how many sets of memories a single thought record can hold.
  Memories stored in a _thought record_ can be used along with reality-altering magic such as _miracle_ or _wish_ to bring back those irrevocably lost to death. Opinions differ on whether this amounts to an exotic _resurrection_ or if it overwrites a newborn soul with the experiences of another.
  A _thought record_ can allow its holder to experience portions of another's life in an instant. It is unclear what act triggers this replay, though most commonly it happens immediately when a creature first touches the device. When the _thought record_ replays the past, the holder experiences the memories stored in the device not just as though she were present, but as if she were consciously making the choices herself.
  Occult researchers speculate that _thought records_ create conduits to the Akashic Record, and that experiencing memories stored within such a rod brings the consciousness of the holder into the past of another person, forming a gestalt of their minds. This gestalt experiences and affects the events as they took place, not merely when they were recorded. According to this theory, those experiencing a memory don't merely observe another's life—they take a role in shaping it. Some even suspect that a _thought record_ can share memories that have yet to be stored. Whatever the explanation, the experiences of the _thought record_ are so total that the creature living the memories suffers from any mental conditions suffered in the memories, such as insanity, damage to mental ability scores, and mind-affecting effects.
  Although a _thought record_ can record the memories of many individuals, it almost never replays more than one creature's memories for a single user. Instead, later activations by that user replay other memories from the same creature, revealing more of its life. Repeated activation takes the user through another's life in bursts of instantaneous visions. The _thought record_ does not replay recorded memories in sequential order. Instead, it skips back and forth across the life of the recorder, with later activations shedding light on earlier activations, regardless of their chronological order.
  The same temporal effects that let a _thought record_ transmit memories across time render it nearly invulnerable to physical harm. Both the rod and the memories stored within resist any attempts at destruction or alteration."

### Description

Though this tube resembles a simple copper pipe, its exotic metal reshapes the flow of time itself. A _[[items/Wondrous Item/Thought Record|thought record]]_ measures 1 foot in length, and despite its light weight, it resists sudden acceleration as if it were a heavy, massive tree trunk. Intricate patterns are etched inside the tube, constantly shifting into new configurations that never repeat. Thought records store and replay memories, absorbing the entirety of a person's experience in an instant. These memories remain in the _thought record_ indefinitely and can't be altered, though subsequent recordings from the same individual can be added. Thought records absorb such imprints unpredictably, with no indication of when the artifact will trigger or how to activate it deliberately. When the _thought record_ records a life, its etched metal surface fades, appearing instead as a tiny window into a cosmic starscape. No known limit exists as to how many sets of memories a single _thought record_ can hold.

Memories stored in a _thought record_ can be used along with reality-altering magic such as _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_ or _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ to bring back those irrevocably lost to death. Opinions differ on whether this amounts to an exotic _[[spells/Resurrection|resurrection]]_ or if it overwrites a newborn soul with the experiences of another.
