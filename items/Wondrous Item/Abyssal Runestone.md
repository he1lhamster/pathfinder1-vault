Title: "Abyssal Runestone"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "–"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "20"
Aura: "strong conjuration"
Description: |
  "An _Abyssal runestone_ allows a spellcaster to cast _lesser planar binding_, _planar binding_, or _greater planar binding_, provided the spellcaster has prepared a spell of equal or greater level to expend during the casting; the planar binding spell functions at a caster level equal to the spellcaster's, not to the _Abyssal runestone_. Spontaneous spellcasters cannot use _Abyssal runestones_ in this way.
  If a chaotic evil outsider eats an _Abyssal runestone_, the runestone is destroyed and the outsider permanently gains the advanced creature template. A creature that already has this template, or is above CR 20 in power, gains no benefit from eating an _Abyssal runestone_.
  _Abyssal runestones_ may have several other uses as components in rituals and powerful magic, particularly in quickening the effects of afflictions associated with the Abyss—for example, the creation of a fast-acting, highly contagious variant of the polymorph plague (see _Pathfinder #135: Runeplague_) requires the expenditure of an _Abyssal runestone_."
Destruction: |
  "An _Abyssal runestone_ is destroyed if it is eaten by a chaotic evil outsider or used in one of the rare occult rituals that can be bolstered by its sacrifice."

### Description

An _[[items/Wondrous Item/Abyssal Runestone|Abyssal runestone]]_ allows a spellcaster to cast lesser _[[spells/Planar Binding|planar binding]]_, _planar binding_, or greater _planar binding_, provided the spellcaster has prepared a spell of equal or greater level to _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ during the casting; the _planar binding_ spell functions at a caster level equal to the spellcaster's, not to the _Abyssal runestone_. Spontaneous spellcasters cannot use Abyssal runestones in this way.

If a chaotic evil outsider eats an _Abyssal runestone_, the runestone is destroyed and the outsider permanently gains the advanced creature template. A creature that already has this template, or is above CR 20 in power, gains no benefit from eating an _Abyssal runestone_.

Abyssal runestones may have several other uses as components in rituals and powerful magic, particularly in quickening the effects of afflictions associated with the Abyss—for example, the creation of a fast-acting, highly contagious variant of the _[[spells/Polymorph|polymorph]]_ plague (see Pathfinder #135: Runeplague) requires the expenditure of an _Abyssal runestone_.

### _[[spells/Destruction|Destruction]]_

An _Abyssal runestone_ is destroyed if it is eaten by a chaotic evil outsider or used in one of the rare occult rituals that can be bolstered by its _[[spells/Sacrifice|sacrifice]]_.
