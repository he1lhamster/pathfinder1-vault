Title: "Esoteric Diadem (Lesser)"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "18000 gp"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Headband"
Caster level: "10"
Aura: "moderate evocation"
Description: |
  "The diamond-shaped gems in these metal headbands are typically one of two colors, each corresponding to a different esoteric element: onyx (void) and pink (wood); these elements are found on pages 6–9 of _Pathfinder Player Companion: Occult Origins_. The diadem's gem grants the wearer greater control over its associated element.
  While worn by a kineticist, this item increases the damage dealt by the kineticist's simple and composite blasts that match the element of the inlaid gem by 1d6 points (for a _lesser esoteric diadem_), 2d6 points (for an _esoteric diadem_), or 3d6 points (for a _greater esoteric diadem_). If the blast is a physical blast, the extra damage dice from the _esoteric diadem_ increase to d8s instead of d6s. These extra damage dice don't multiply on a critical hit, and they don't apply to blasts with form infusions that don't apply the extra damage from elemental overflow.
  Other _esoteric diadem_ variants exist for other little-known kineticist elements."

##### Magical properties

### Description

The diamond-shaped gems in these metal headbands are typically one of two colors, each corresponding to a different esoteric element: onyx (void) and pink (wood); these elements are found on pages 6–9 of Pathfinder Player Companion: Occult Origins. The diadem's gem grants the wearer greater control over its associated element.

While worn by a _[[classes/Kineticist|kineticist]]_, this item increases the damage dealt by the _kineticist_'s simple and composite blasts that match the element of the inlaid gem by 1d6 points (for a lesser esoteric diadem), 2d6 points (for an esoteric diadem), or 3d6 points (for a greater esoteric diadem). If the blast is a physical blast, the extra damage dice from the esoteric diadem increase to d8s instead of d6s. These extra damage dice don't multiply on a critical hit, and they don't apply to blasts with form infusions that don't apply the extra damage from elemental overflow.

Other esoteric diadem variants exist for other little-known _kineticist_ elements.
