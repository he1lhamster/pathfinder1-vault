Description: |
  "The _witch ice shard_ is crafted from witch ice, a mysterious substance found only beneath the windswept reaches of Witch Queen's demesne. This glittering cerulean ice has many fell uses, but one of the Queen's favorites is as a dread prison for her foes. Once prepared by Queen, the _witch ice shard_ absorbs the soul of the first non-fey to touch it as a _trap the soul_ spell. Worse yet, anyone trapped within becomes fuel for the crystal's bearer, painfully consumed by the power of the shard as their new owner drains their life force away to use as they wish. A fey creature may absorb one of the trapped creature's levels to gain an additional use of one of its daily supernatural or spell-like abilities. When the trapped creature's last level is drained, they are forever consumed and cannot be returned to life by any magic short of a _wish_ or _miracle_. This particular shard possesses Tessa's soul, granting its bearer 10 levels worth of power. Each time one is used, Tessa loses a level until her soul is completely consumed.
  Shattering a _witch ice shard_ frees a trapped soul, who then must make a DC 15 Fortitude save for every level lost (failure results in the level drain being permanent). Unlike most artifacts, a _witch ice shard_ is fragile. The crystal has a Hardness of 10, 15 hp and a Break DC of 25."
