Weight: "0.5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "1"
Aura: "faint divination"
Description: |
  "This crystalline hand-sized scorpion figurine is so full of cracks and occlusions that it looks as if it could fall apart at any minute. As a standard action you may throw the _sentinel scorpion_ to the ground, causing it to explode into crystalline shards that cover the ground in a 10-foot burst. When any creature steps in the area, the shards make popping sounds as loud as the audible version of the _alarm_ spell. A creature moving in the area of the shards has a 10% chance each round of stepping on the stinger. The stinger injects Large scorpion venom (1d6 Str/1d6 Str, Fort DC 18 negates) and is treated as a trap (Search DC 20, Disable Device DC 20). After 2 hours, the shards decay into harmless powder."
