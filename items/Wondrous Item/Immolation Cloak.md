Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "65000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Shoulders"
Caster level: "6"
Aura: "moderate evocation"
Description: |
  "An _immolation cloak_ grants its wearer resist fire 20. As a swift action, the wearer can command the cloak to burst into flame, providing the benefits of a _fire shield_ (warm flames only). The wearer can dismiss the flames as a free action. The cloak can be used for a maximum of 10 rounds per day, which don't have to be consecutive.
  By expending one use of mythic power, the cloak's wearer can recharge its immolation abilities. In addition, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to detonate in a fiery explosion, dealing 1d8 points of fire damage per character level in a 30-foot-radius spread. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + the wearer's mythic tier + the wearer's Charisma modifier) halves this damage. Though apparently destroyed in the explosion, the wearer reforms just prior to the start of his next turn in the space he exploded in (or the nearest open space if that space is unavailable)."
