Description: |
  "A _security belt_ increases the DC of Sleight of Hand checks made against the wearer and checks to locate items or weapons hidden on the wearer's person by 5. The wearer also gets a +5 bonus to CMD against the steal maneuver. Once per day on command, the wearer can touch a single item of up to 10 cubic feet and shrink it into a tiny cloth duplicate as the _shrink item_ spell. With a move action, the wearer can draw one of these items from one of the belt's pockets and return it to normal size. It is difficult to detect a _security belt_ and any items in the pockets as magic. They are affected as though a constant _magic aura_ spell were making them appear nonmagical."
