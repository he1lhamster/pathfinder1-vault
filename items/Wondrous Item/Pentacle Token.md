Aura: "strong conjuration"
Description: |
  "Roughly the size of a saucer, this thin ceramic disc is painted red and marked with an inverted pentagram, the unholy symbol of Asmodeus. A _pentacle token_ must first be attuned to a devil by touching the token to a devil as a standard action. A single _pentacle token_ can be attuned to one devil of CR 9 or higher, or up to five devils of CR 8 or lower. An individual devil can be attuned to only one _pentacle token_ at a time. Attuning a _pentacle token_ to additional devils beyond these limits replaces earlier attunements, starting with the earliest attunement.
  An attuned _pentacle token_ can be broken as a standard action, immediately alerting all devils attuned to that token of the owner's location and the distance and direction to it. If the devil has the _greater teleport_ spell-like ability, it can use that ability as an immediate action to transport itself to a square adjacent to the broken _pentacle token_. Teleporting to the token's location in this way increases the devil's damage reduction by 5 (for example, from DR 10/good to DR 15/good) for 1 hour (if the devil does not already have damage reduction, it gains DR 5/good for 1 hour). The creature breaking a pentacle token has no control over or command of any devils attuned to that token. Once a _pentacle token_ is broken, it loses its magic and cannot be used again."
