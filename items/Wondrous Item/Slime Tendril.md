Description: |
  "A horrid, slimy whip crafted from a severed aboleth's tentacle, the _slime tendril_ grants the wielder unpleasant transformative powers akin to those of the aboleths. The wielder of the _slime tendril_ can breathe water as well as air, as if under a constant _water breathing_effect.
  The _slime tendril_ functions as a _+3 quenching scorpion whip_. Three times per day as an immediate action, when the wielder damages a creature with the _slime tendril_, the wielder can force the creature to attempt a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw. Victims who fail this save are subjected to an aboleth's slime extraordinary ability. Use of the _slime tendril_ imparts a slow, terrible transformation upon the wielder. One day after the wielder first uses the _slime tendril_ to affect another creature with the slime ability, the wielder's skin grows rubbery, increasing her natural armor bonus by 2. One week later, the wielder gains the aquatic subtype and the amphibious special quality, and she starts to experience strange dreams of cyclopean architecture in cavernous ocean trenches and a strong desire to live in the open ocean. If the wielder subsequently refrains from using the weapon's slime ability, these changes reverse after 1d4 months. Each time the wielder uses the weapon's slime ability during this time, she must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or transform permanently into a skum, using the statistics from the _Bestiary_ in place of her own. This transformation cannot be reversed while the wielder carries the _slime tendril_, and a _wish_ or a _miracle_ is required to reverse it otherwise. A wielder transformed into a skum by the _slime tendril_ has a soul-piercing longing for the ocean and takes 1d4 Wisdom drain each day she spends on dry land.
  Aboleths within 10 miles of the _slime tendril_ automatically become aware of the weapon's distance and direction, and they can use their _dominate monster_ spell-like ability on the slime tendril's wielder as if the wielder were in the ability's normal range."
Destruction: |
  "The slime tendril is destroyed if the aboleth from which it was originally cut holds the weapon and is the target of a _regenerate_ spell, restoring the aboleth's limb and destroying the slime tendril."
