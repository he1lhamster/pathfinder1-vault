Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "600 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "3"
Aura: "faint transmutation"
Description: |
  "This empty clay jar, suitable for holding a few ounces of liquid, smells of freshly tilled earth and changes hue in sunlight. A _jar of mottled clay_ can be thrown as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.
  When the jar strikes a creature or a solid object, a mound of earth and clay rises up from where it struck. The mound is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall, and has a hardness of 2 and 40 hit points. A creature struck by a direct hit must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or be pushed back 5 feet and knocked prone as the mound erupts where the target was standing. Success allows the creature struck to move 5 feet in any direction and avoid being knocked prone.
  The mound lasts for 3 rounds before losing its structure and collapsing into a pile of dirt. A creature can topple a mound with a successful DC 18 Strength check; creatures within 10 feet on the opposite side of the mound must attempt Reflex saves as if directly struck by the _jar of mottled clay_. When a mound collapses or is destroyed, it creates difficult terrain in a 5-foot-radius area centered on the square where it was created.
  A _jar of mottled clay_ can optionally be filled with an alchemical item. Filling a jar requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check. When thrown, a modified jar applies the effects of the alchemical item along with its own effect; contradictory or bizarre combinations of effects are subject to the GM's discretion."
