Description: |
  "Pazuzu's weapon is the _Scepter of Shibaxet_, a staff of black metal with a large hook at its tip. The scepter functions as a _rod of enemy detection_ that can be used any number of times per day. If Pazuzu presents the scepter as a standard action, all creatures within 30 feet who view it become panicked for 1d6 rounds unless they succeed at a DC 23 Will save (this is a mindaffecting fear effect). Once per day, Pazuzu can use the _Scepter of Shibaxet_ as a _rod of cancellation_ (this does not deplete or harm the scepter). As a standard action, he can call the scepter to his hand from any distance, even across planar boundaries. As an immediate action, Pazuzu can transform the scepter into a _+5 anarchic keen unholy longsword_ or return it to its normal shape. None of its other powers can be used in sword form."
Destruction: |
  "The _Scepter of Shibaxet_ can be broken by a redeemed demon lord if the regenerating towers of Shibaxet are already destroyed."
