Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "5400 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "3"
Aura: "faint transmutation"
Description: |
  "This metal urn is identical in appearance to an _efreeti bottle_, except that it does nothing but smoke. The amount of smoke is great if the stopper is pulled out, pouring from the bottle and totally obscuring vision across a 50-foot spread in 1 round. If the bottle is left unstoppered, the smoke billows out another 10 feet per round until it has covered a 100-foot radius. This area remains smoke-filled until the _eversmoking bottle_ is stoppered.
  The bottle must be resealed by a command word, after which the smoke dissipates normally. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the smoke in 1 round."
