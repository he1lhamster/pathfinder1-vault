Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "75000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Body"
Caster level: "14"
Aura: "strong universal"
Description: |
  "This normal-appearing garment is attuned to one of three types of alignment. It can be white (01–45 on d%, good alignment), gray (46–75, neither good nor evil alignment), or black (76–100, evil alignment). To most wearers, the robe offers no powers or has no effects unless the wearer's alignment doesn't match that of the robe (see below). Only an arcane spellcaster can fully realize this potent magic item's powers once the robe is donned. These powers are as follows.
  If a white robe is donned by an evil character, she immediately gains three permanent negative levels. The same is true with respect to a black robe donned by a good character. An evil or good character who puts on a gray robe, or a neutral character who dons either a white or black robe, gains two permanent negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the garment is worn and cannot be overcome in any way (including through _restoration_ spells). Negative levels are immediately removed if the robe is removed from the wearer."
