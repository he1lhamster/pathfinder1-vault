Price: "4000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "10"
Aura: "moderate divination"
Description: |
  "This oily black paste is kept in a glass jar about the size of a human's fist. When rubbed onto an opaque surface as a standard action, an application of _smear of seeing_ allows others to see through it for 10 minutes or until it is thoroughly diluted with universal solvent, after which the smear loses its potency. Anyone on the side of the surface on which the smear was applied can see through that surface as though it were a clear glass window. This does not enable creatures to hear through the surface. Creatures on the other side of a surface affected with _smear of seeing_ cannot see the effect, but may detect it via _detect magic_ or other effects as normal.
  _Smear of seeing_ can be used on plaster, stone, wooden, or similar surfaces up to 10 feet thick. _Smear of seeing_ has no effect on metal or harder materials, regardless of thickness.
  One application of _smear of seeing_ is enough to cover a 1-foot-radius area; multiple applications can be used to increase the affected surface area. One jar of _smear of seeing_ contains enough paste for five applications."
