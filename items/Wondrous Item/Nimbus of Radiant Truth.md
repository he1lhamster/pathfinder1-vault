Description: |
  "The _Nimbus of Radiant Truth_ exists only when good has need of a great champion. Such a champion can attain it only though a perilous quest that tests mettle and righteousness. Rather than being a physical object, the _Nimbus of Radiant Truth_ manifests as a glowing halo of light around the wearer's head. It's ordinarily as bright as _continual flame_, but in battle it brightens to the dazzling brilliance of _daylight_. Its radiance is treated as resulting from a 9th-level spell for purposes of interaction with other sources of light and darkness. The radiance of the nimbus can be suppressed or resumed as a standard action.
  The _Nimbus of Radiant Truth_ grants a +6 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and Charisma. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the nimbus is worn. Its wearer can't deliberately utter a lie, though the nimbus doesn't prevent other forms of deception, evasiveness, and giving incomplete answers within the boundaries of the truth. All of the wearer's natural weapons and any weapons she wields overcome damage reduction as though they were good-aligned. In addition, the _Nimbus of Radiant Truth_ has the following powers.
  The wearer of the _Nimbus of Radiant Truth_ can remove it as though it were a physical item, and place it either on the head of another creature or on an inanimate object. When placed on an inanimate object, the _Nimbus of Radiant Truth_ can be picked up. When placed on a living creature, it can't be removed except by the wearer's conscious choice.
  When donned by a creature of evil alignment, the nimbus blasts the creature for 20d6 points of damage, then teleports 1d10×10 miles away in a random direction. However, if the wearer becomes evil some time after donning it, the _nimbus_ retains its powers and doesn't damage the wearer. The nimbus cannot be deceived by any mortal means of masking alignment (including mythic abilities)."
Destruction: |
  "The _Nimbus of Radiant Truth_ can be destroyed by placing it on the head of a person who was once completely good and innocent, but is now corrupted into the vilest depths of evil and depravity."

### Description

The _[[items/Wondrous Item/Nimbus of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Radiant|Radiant]]_ Truth|Nimbus of _Radiant_ Truth]]_ exists only when good has need of a great _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Champion|champion]]_. Such a _champion_ can attain it only though a perilous quest that tests mettle and righteousness. Rather than being a physical object, the _Nimbus of _Radiant_ Truth_ manifests as a glowing halo of light around the wearer's head. It's ordinarily as bright as _[[spells/Continual Flame|continual flame]]_, but in battle it brightens to the dazzling brilliance of _[[spells/Daylight|daylight]]_. Its _[[items/Weapon/Radiance|radiance]]_ is treated as resulting from a 9th-level spell for purposes of interaction with other sources of light and _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_. The _radiance_ of the nimbus can be suppressed or resumed as a standard action.

The _Nimbus of _Radiant_ Truth_ grants a +6 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and Charisma. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the nimbus is worn. Its wearer can't deliberately utter a lie, though the nimbus doesn't prevent other forms of deception, evasiveness, and giving incomplete answers within the boundaries of the truth. All of the wearer's natural weapons and any weapons she wields overcome _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_ as though they were good-aligned. In addition, the _Nimbus of _Radiant_ Truth_ has the following powers.

* The wearer can bring forth a _[[spells/Zone of Truth|zone of truth]]_ (DC 20) with a 40-foot radius at will. By expending one use of mythic power, the DC increases to 30.
* As an immediate action, the wearer can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ one use of mythic power to gain the benefits of _[[spells/Freedom|freedom]]_'s call (as the Liberation domain power) or nimbus of light (as the Sun domain power) for 2 minutes. For purposes of this power, the wearer has a _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ level equal to her character level. Either power can be dismissed as a free action, but any unused duration is lost.
* Seven times per day, the wearer can _[[spells/Cure Moderate Wounds|cure moderate wounds]]_ as a _cleric_ with a caster level equal to her character level. The wearer adds her mythic tier to the hit points healed.
* Three times per day, the wearer can unleash a _[[spells/Holy Aura|holy aura]]_ (DC 25) or an empowered _[[spells/Holy Smite|holy smite]]_ (DC 22).
* Once per day, the wearer can unleash a blast of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Righteous|righteous]]_ power. Treat this as _[[spells/Sunburst|sunburst]]_ (DC 27) centered on the wearer, except that it has no effect on good-aligned creatures and inflicts double damage to evil-aligned creatures. After this power is used, the nimbus fades to a barely visible glow for 1 hour, and the wearer loses access to all of its powers save its enhancement bonuses. She remains unable to lie.
* Once per week, the wearer can _expend_ one use of mythic power to perform a _[[spells/Resurrection|resurrection]]_.
