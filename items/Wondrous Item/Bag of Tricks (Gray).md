The animal serves the character who drew it from the bag for 10 minutes (or until slain or ordered back into the bag), at which point it disappears. It can follow any of the commands described in the Handle Animal skill. Each of the three kinds of bags of tricks produces a different set of animals. Use the following tables to determine what animals can be drawn out of each.
