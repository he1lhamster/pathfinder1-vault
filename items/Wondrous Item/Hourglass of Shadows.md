Description: |
  "The _Hourglass of Shadows_ is a foul artifact that allows the user to process a creature's remains into an undead shadow. The unwieldy, 5-foottall device rests suspended on an iron stand fitted with pivots that allow its user to rotate a central chamber of etched, smoke-colored glass. To operate the device, the user must place the ashes of a Small, Medium, or Large sentient creature into the glass chamber along with a crushed onyx worth 100 gp. After the ashes have flowed through the chamber three times—a process that takes 3 hours—the contents can be emptied. If deposited into a clay pot filled with grave dirt and brackish water, the ashes transform the mundane container into a _shadow urn_. A creature whose remains have been defiled in this way cannot be restored to life by any method short of a _miracle_ or _wish_ until the _shadow urn_ containing its spirit has been destroyed.
  A _shadow urn_ contains an unquiet spirit befouled by the _Hourglass of Shadows_. These fragile urns can be thrown, have a range increment of 10 feet, and shatter on contact with any creature or solid surface. When a _shadow urn_ is broken, the single greater shadow contained within is released. This shadow is free-willed—owing no allegiance to the owner of the _Hourglass of Shadows_ or whoever broke its urn—and typically attacks the nearest creature, seeking to sate its hunger for life energy. A _shadow urn_ is destroyed when it is used. If not shattered, a _shadow urn_ contains the soul within indefinitely."
Destruction: |
  "Casting a spell with the light descriptor on the _Hourglass of Shadows_ renders it inoperative for 1 day per level of the spell. Casting _sunburst_ on the _Hourglass_ under the light of the noonday sun causes it to shatter. Similarly, a _shadow urn_ broken in an area of full natural sunlight destroys the shadow within rather than releasing it."

The _[[items/Wondrous Item/Hourglass of Shadows|Hourglass of Shadows]]_ is a foul artifact that allows the user to process a creature's remains into an undead _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|shadow]]_. The unwieldy, 5-foottall device rests suspended on an iron stand fitted with pivots that allow its user to rotate a central chamber of etched, smoke-colored glass. To operate the device, the user must place the ashes of a Small, _[[classes/Medium|Medium]]_, or Large sentient creature into the glass chamber along with a crushed onyx worth 100 gp. After the ashes have flowed through the chamber three times—a process that takes 3 hours—the contents can be emptied. If deposited into a _[[items/Mundane/Clay|clay]]_ pot filled with grave dirt and brackish water, the ashes transform the mundane container into a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Shadow Urn|shadow urn]]_. A creature whose remains have been defiled in this way cannot be restored to life by any method short of a _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_ or _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ until the _shadow urn_ containing its spirit has been destroyed.

A _shadow urn_ contains an unquiet spirit befouled by the _Hourglass of Shadows_. These fragile urns can be thrown, have a range increment of 10 feet, and _[[spells/Shatter|shatter]]_ on contact with any creature or solid surface. When a _shadow urn_ is _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_, the single greater _shadow_ contained within is released. This _shadow_ is free-willed—owing no allegiance to the owner of the _Hourglass of Shadows_ or whoever broke its urn—and typically attacks the nearest creature, seeking to sate its hunger for life energy. A _shadow urn_ is destroyed when it is used. If not shattered, a _shadow urn_ contains the soul within indefinitely.

Casting a spell with the light descriptor on the _Hourglass of Shadows_ renders it inoperative for 1 day per level of the spell. Casting _[[spells/Sunburst|sunburst]]_ on the _[[items/Mundane/Hourglass|Hourglass]]_ under the light of the noonday sun causes it to _shatter_. Similarly, a _shadow urn_ _broken_ in an area of full natural sunlight destroys the _shadow_ within rather than releasing it.
