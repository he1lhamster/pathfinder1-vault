  "This wood and iron weapon resembles a light crossbow with a very short prod. The prod itself is non-functional, but provides the _water scorpion_ with excellent balance. The _water scorpion_ functions as a _+1 weapon_ that magically produces a stream of holy water with a range of 30 feet each time it is fired. The stream strikes its opponent as a ranged touch attack that deals 2d4+1 points of damage to undead and evil outsiders. To other creatures it is harmless. Only one stream might be fired each round, but there are rumors of _water scorpions of speed_ created from the original.
  Anyone proficient with crossbows may use a _water scorpion_ without penalty."
