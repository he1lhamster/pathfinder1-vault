Description: |
  "Resembling ordinary paper, _planar parchment_ is used when negotiating with outsiders via spells like _planar ally_ or _planar binding_. Using the parchment as part of negotiations grants the user a +2 bonus on her Charisma check to coerce the called outsider if such a check is required.
  _Planar parchment_ offers some autonomy to outsiders called for longer missions via _planar ally_. The use of _planar parchment_ increases the time for a _planar ally_ from 1 day per caster level to 1 week per caster level for long-term tasks (without increasing the cost of the payment the outsider requires). An outsider that has its term of service increased in this way isn't bound to the plane to which it was called. After negotiations are complete, it can return to its home plane, but is still required to perform the services it agreed to complete.
  Regardless of whether the outsider was called via _planar ally_ or _planar binding_ magic, the outsider maintains a connection with the _planar parchment_ for the duration of its service. Any writings added to the parchment are instantly transmitted to the bound outsider, as a _sending_ spell (with no chance of failure if the outsider is on another plane). These words disappear from the parchment 1 hour after being inscribed.
  Finally, once an outsider is bound to service with a _planar parchment_, the parchment is inscribed with script visible only to the creature completing the negotiation, or via _true seeing_. Reading this script is a full-round action, akin to reading a scroll. Reading this aloud immediately summons the bound outsider to the location of the scroll.
  A _planar parchment_ can be used for only one negotiation, and then turns into a nonmagical piece of parchment."

### Description

Resembling ordinary paper, _[[items/Wondrous Item/Planar Parchment|planar parchment]]_ is used when negotiating with outsiders via spells like _[[spells/Planar Ally|planar ally]]_ or _[[spells/Planar Binding|planar binding]]_. Using the parchment as part of negotiations grants the user a +2 bonus on her Charisma check to coerce the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ outsider if such a check is required.

_Planar parchment_ offers some autonomy to outsiders _called_ for longer missions via _planar ally_. The use of _planar parchment_ increases the time for a _planar ally_ from 1 day per caster level to 1 week per caster level for long-term tasks (without increasing the cost of the payment the outsider requires). An outsider that has its term of service increased in this way isn't bound to the plane to which it was _called_. After negotiations are complete, it can return to its home plane, but is still required to perform the services it agreed to complete.

Regardless of whether the outsider was _called_ via _planar ally_ or _planar binding_ magic, the outsider maintains a connection with the _planar parchment_ for the duration of its service. Any writings added to the parchment are instantly transmitted to the bound outsider, as a _[[spells/Sending|sending]]_ spell (with no chance of failure if the outsider is on another plane). These words disappear from the parchment 1 hour after being inscribed.

Finally, once an outsider is bound to service with a _planar parchment_, the parchment is inscribed with script visible only to the creature completing the negotiation, or via _[[spells/True Seeing|true seeing]]_. Reading this script is a full-round action, akin to reading a scroll. Reading this aloud immediately summons the bound outsider to the location of the scroll.

A _planar parchment_ can be used for only one negotiation, and then turns into a nonmagical piece of parchment.
