  "This gold amulet is fashioned in the shape of a winged scarab beetle holding a large ruby that represents the solar disk. The scarab grants its wearer a +4 bonus on saving throws against fear effects, and enables its wearer to detect any mummy within 60 feet, although he must concentrate as a standard action to use this ability. In addition, anytime the wearer would be affected by a curse or disease effect, the _scarab of mummy defense_ can absorb the effect with no harm to the wearer. Upon absorbing 12 such effects, the scarab turns to dust and is destroyed. An effect that's both a curse and a disease, such as mummy rot, is considered a single effect for these purposes."
