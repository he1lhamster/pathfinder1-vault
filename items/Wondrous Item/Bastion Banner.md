Title: "Bastion Banner"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "182000 gp"
Weight: "3 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "10"
Aura: "moderate universal"
Description: |
  "This banner, emblazoned with a good or lawful deity's holy symbol, is meant to be carried and displayed and has no effect when not mounted properly or when lying on the ground. A _bastion banner_ emits a _hallow_ effect in a 40-foot radius around it, so long as it is borne by one true to the religion whose holy symbol graces the banner.
  Within the 40-foot radius of its _hallow_ effect, a planted _bastion banner_ secures terrain that would otherwise be unstable, whether due to natural causes (such as a mudslide) or supernatural causes (such as a specific plane's morphic trait). Natural terrain is simply fixed in its current configuration and cannot be altered naturally or magically; a spellcaster attempting to change the terrain affected by a _bastion banner_ (such as with _move earth_ or _transmute mud to rock_) must make a successful DC 21 caster level check to do so. Unnaturally or magically morphic terrain (such as that on the Abyss) is shaped into a 40-foot sphere with the topmost hemispherical half composed of breathable air and the lower hemispherical half composed of packed earth. This effect only secures basic footing against collapse; it cannot impede moving objects from outside the area (such as rain or an avalanche) or forces that act physically on the soil (such as shovels or tunneling creatures).
  When planted, a _bastion banner_ also has a specific spell tied to the _hallow_ effect, as well as an additional effect, both tied to the holy symbol it bears. When a _bastion banner_ affects allies, the allies must worship the same deity as the one portrayed on the banner to benefit from the deity-specific spell and effect, and only as long as they are within 40 feet of the banner. Enemies must also be within 40 feet of the banner to be affected. The spells and effects associated with each deity are:
  **Abadar**: _Protection from energy_ (type is set when banner is planted; renews daily); allies gain a +4 sacred bonus on checks to aid another.
  **Asmodeus**: _Cause fear_ (affects enemies only), and the _hallow_ effect is _unhallow_ instead; allies gain a +2 morale bonus on combat maneuver checks.
  **Cayden Cailean**: _Remove fear_; whenever allies successfully resist a fear effect, they gain 10 temporary hit points for 1 hour.
  **Desna**: _Freedom of movement_; once per day, whenever the banner's owner or an ally rolls a d20, the owner of the banner may choose to treat the roll as a natural 20.
  **Erastil**: _Invisibility purge_; allies gain a +1 morale bonus on damage and attack rolls with ranged weapons.
  **Iomedae**: _Death ward_; allies gain a +1 morale bonus on damage and attack rolls with melee weapons.
  **Irori**: _Resist energy_ (type is set when banner is planted); allies gain a +2 sacred bonus on saves.
  **Sarenrae**: _Daylight_; all spells with the fire or light descriptor cast from within the affected area are cast at +1 caster level.
  **Shelyn**: _Tongues_; allies gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma.
  **Torag**: _Dimensional anchor_; allies gain a +2 sacred bonus to AC.
  **Zon-Kuthon**: _Darkness_, and _hallow_ effect is _unhallow_ instead; enemies are sickened."

### Description

This _[[items/Mundane/Banner|banner]]_, emblazoned with a good or lawful deity's holy symbol, is meant to be carried and displayed and has no effect when not mounted properly or when lying on the ground. A _[[items/Wondrous Item/Bastion Banner|bastion banner]]_ emits a _[[spells/Hallow|hallow]]_ effect in a 40-foot radius around it, so long as it is borne by one true to the religion whose holy symbol graces the _banner_.

Within the 40-foot radius of its _hallow_ effect, a planted _bastion banner_ secures terrain that would otherwise be unstable, whether due to natural causes (such as a mudslide) or supernatural causes (such as a specific plane's morphic trait). Natural terrain is simply fixed in its current configuration and cannot be altered naturally or magically; a spellcaster attempting to change the terrain affected by a _bastion banner_ (such as with _[[spells/Move Earth|move earth]]_ or _[[spells/Transmute Mud to Rock|transmute mud to rock]]_) must make a successful DC 21 caster level check to do so. Unnaturally or magically morphic terrain (such as that on the Abyss) is shaped into a 40-foot sphere with the topmost hemispherical half composed of breathable air and the lower hemispherical half composed of packed earth. This effect only secures basic footing against collapse; it cannot impede moving objects from outside the area (such as rain or an avalanche) or forces that act physically on the soil (such as shovels or tunneling creatures).

When planted, a _bastion banner_ also has a specific spell tied to the _hallow_ effect, as well as an additional effect, both tied to the holy symbol it bears. When a _bastion banner_ affects allies, the allies must worship the same deity as the one portrayed on the _banner_ to benefit from the deity-specific spell and effect, and only as long as they are within 40 feet of the _banner_. Enemies must also be within 40 feet of the _banner_ to be affected. The spells and effects associated with each deity are:

**Abadar**: _[[spells/Protection from Energy|Protection from energy]]_ (type is set when _banner_ is planted; renews daily); allies gain a +4 _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sacred|sacred]]_ bonus on checks to aid another.

**Asmodeus**: _[[spells/Cause Fear|Cause fear]]_ (affects enemies only), and the _hallow_ effect is _[[spells/Unhallow|unhallow]]_ instead; allies gain a +2 morale bonus on combat maneuver checks.

**Cayden Cailean**: _[[spells/Remove Fear|Remove fear]]_; whenever allies successfully resist a _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effect, they gain 10 temporary hit points for 1 hour.

**Desna**: _[[spells/Freedom of Movement|Freedom of movement]]_; once per day, whenever the _banner_'s owner or an ally rolls a d20, the owner of the _banner_ may choose to treat the roll as a natural 20.

**Erastil**: _[[spells/Invisibility Purge|Invisibility purge]]_; allies gain a +1 morale bonus on damage and attack rolls with ranged weapons.

**Iomedae**: _[[spells/Death Ward|Death ward]]_; allies gain a +1 morale bonus on damage and attack rolls with melee weapons.
