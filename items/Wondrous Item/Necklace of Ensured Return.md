Description: |
  "This lavish necklace is crafted from gold and interwoven bands of silver. The coils of precious metal end in a receptacle bearing a pristine opal gemstone. The necklace does not radiate a magic aura unless viewed with _true seeing_ or a similarly powerful spell. If the wearer is slain, her soul is immediately moved into the gemstone on the necklace, as per _trap the soul_.
  At the time of her death while wearing this necklace, the wearer whose soul is moved into its gemstone must choose a period of time ranging from 1 to 14 days. (The period of time selected can be more specific but must be measured in an increment no smaller than an hour; for example, 3 days and 6 hours.) After the selected amount of time passes, the gemstone shatters, releasing the dead wearer's soul. Her body then immediately re-forms in a space within 60 feet of where the gem shattered, regardless of the condition of her body at the time of her death, as per _true resurrection_.
  If the gem is destroyed prior to the elapsing of the specified time, the dead wearer's body re-forms immediately. The individual whose soul is released from the necklace can choose where her body re-forms at the time the gem shatters. Once the former wearer is resurrected, the necklace turns to lead and becomes worthless."
