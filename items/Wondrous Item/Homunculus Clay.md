Description: |
  "If a mutagen is poured onto this fist-sized lump of dry clay (a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity), it transforms into a homunculus. It treats the alchemist who provided the mutagen as its creator. The homunculus gains the benefits of the mutagen. For every 2 points its Constitution would be increased, it instead gains 1 additional hit point per Hit Die and a +1 bonus on Fortitude saves, and the DC of its poison increases by 1. When the effect of the mutagen ends or the homunculus is slain, it reverts to a lump of clay that can be used again at a later time. If the _homunculus clay_ is broken or destroyed in its inactive form, it is forever ruined."
