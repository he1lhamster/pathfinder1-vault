Description: |
  "A _lantern of auras_ is a bullseye lantern made of cold iron with a series of lenses and colored glass filters that can be flipped down in front of its main aperture. The lantern functions as a bullseye lantern but needs no oil to shed its light. If its command word is spoken, it begins to reveal magic auras as the _detect magic_ spell. It will reveal all auras _detect magic_ reveals over the normal duration of 3 rounds, as long as its light is held on the same area for this duration. Anyone who takes a full-round action to observe the revealed auras during each of these rounds can attempt a Knowledge (arcana) skill check to determine the school of any magic aura revealed, or a Spellcraft check to identify the properties of a magic item within the area.
  Roughly 45% of these lanterns have the command word etched on the bottom of the lantern. Casting _identify_ on a _lantern of auras_ reveals the command word."
