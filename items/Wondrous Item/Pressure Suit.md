Title: "Pressure Suit"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "4000 gp"
Weight: "30 lbs."
Slot: "Body"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "faint abjuration"
Description: |
  "This magical full-body suit completely protects the wearer from temperature extremes (as if by _endure elements_) and pressure dangers of hard vacuum and all worlds in the system (save the sun), though it only carries enough air for 3 days before it must be recharged in breathable atmosphere (such as that inside a ship). If the suit's seal is broken—such as the helmet being removed to eat or drink—all the air escapes in 2d6 rounds. A suit with a broken seal confers only the benefits of _endure elements_. The suit automatically repairs small holes, but if it is struck by a critical hit from a piercing or slashing weapon, the wearer of the pressure suit must succeed at a Reflex save (DC equal to the opponent's confirmation roll) or the seal breaks. A suit with a broken seal can be repaired with a DC 18 Craft (armor) check or a _make whole_ spell. The suit does not compensate for changes in gravity. Wearing a pressure suit imposes a –1 armor check penalty; this penalty stacks with those provided by other equipment (such as armor). Since it takes up both the body and helm slots, armor can be worn over a pressure suit, but robes and helms cannot."

This magical full-body suit completely protects the wearer from temperature extremes (as if by _[[spells/Endure Elements|endure elements]]_) and pressure dangers of hard vacuum and all worlds in the system (save the sun), though it only carries enough air for 3 days before it must be recharged in breathable atmosphere (such as that inside a ship). If the suit's seal is _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_—such as the helmet being removed to eat or drink—all the air escapes in 2d6 rounds.
