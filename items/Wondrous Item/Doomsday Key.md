Price: "9000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Neck"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate necromancy"
Description: |
  "Created ages before the construction of Windsong Abbey by the cult of Groetus, _doomsday keys_ are used by the cult to seal certain doors in their temples, as well as the legendary _Doomsday Doors_ themselves. See the adventure in this volume for examples of the types of unique locks that _doomsday keys_ can work with.
  Up to three times per day as a standard action made by twisting the key in the air (as if unlocking an invisible lock), a _doomsday key_ causes up to four creatures chosen by and within 20 feet of the user to become shaken for 1 minute (Will DC 14 negates)—this is a mind-affecting effect. A _doomsday key_ can also be used to inflict _bestow curse_ (Will DC 14 negates) once per day—this use requires a successful touch attack. While worn about the neck (and thus taking up the neck item slot), a _doomsday key_ bestows a +4 resistance bonus on the wearer's saving throws made against curse effects; this protection does not help against curses the wearer may already be suffering from."
