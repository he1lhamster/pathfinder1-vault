Description: |
  "The _imago lens_ appears as a 3-foot-diameter semitransparent disc of amber gripped in the jaws of a metal demonic frame. This device functions as a _crystal ball_ with _telepathy_ and _true seeing_ —a successful DC 24 Will save allows a creature to resist being scried upon by the _imago lens_. Once per day, the _imago lens_ may instead be used to create a projected image of the user, as the spell _project image_. The user may project this image into any location she has observed before, either in person or via scrying. Once the image is projected, the user can sense the world around the image as if she were there, communicate with nearby creatures, and even cast spells. The image cannot move from its current location. Using this effect is not without risk; if the image is dispelled, the user must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 4d6 points of Constitution drain as her body reels from the sudden disconnection and her soul is warped and twisted by the lens's powerful magic. The _imago lens_ is a chaotic evil artifact, and each time it is used, a nonchaotic- evil user must also succeed at a DC 25 Will save to resist having her alignment shift one step closer to chaotic evil."
Destruction: |
  "If a demigod is slain while it uses the lens to project an image, the lens shatters and the demigod turns into an insane ghost."
