As such, failed Handle Animal checks made during downtime periods— including those made to rear animals and teach them new tricks—may be treated as if they were successful. The talisman can turn 10 failed checks into successes this way. Once the tenth failed check has been converted to a success, the talisman falls apart and becomes useless."
