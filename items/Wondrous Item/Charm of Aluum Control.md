Description: |
  "This pendant holds a glowing crystal etched with faint runes. Created by the pactmasters of Katapesh to manipulate and control their constructs known as aluums, these charms are much sought after on the black market. Unauthorized possession of a _charm of aluum control_ is considered a grave crime in Katapesh, punishable by decades of imprisonment, exile, or even death. Each _charm of aluum control_ is attuned to a single, specific aluum, but the magic of the charm allows it to function somewhat against other aluums as well. Against its specific attuned aluum, the charm grants you the ability to command that construct as if you were using _dominate person_ on a humanoid creature. This effect functions against other aluums, but non-attuned aluums gain a DC 16 Will save to resist the effect. If an aluum fails such a save, it becomes attuned to that charm and the previous aluum becomes unattuned—a single charm of aluum control can only be attuned to one aluum at a time. For purposes of this effect, ordering an aluum to attack a Pactmaster or someone who appears to be part of Katapesh's government or army or to damage any structure in the city of Katapesh counts as an action against the aluum's nature and allows the aluum a new saving throw with a +2 bonus to resist the charm's effects. If an aluum escapes this effect, it is no longer attuned and typically attacks the target who attempted to command it."
