  "Platinum filigree wraps around this small, spiral-shell amulet, which hangs on an ornate chain that resembles entwined tentacles. Enchantment spells and effects created by the wearer of a _masters' call_ are treated as though they came from an aboleth source, so gillman targets take their racial –2 penalty on Will saves to resist the amulet's effects.
  Once per day, the wearer can speak a trigger phrase in the Aboleth language to cast _dominate person_ on a single target (Will DC 18 negates). Regardless of whether the _dominate person_ spell succeeds, the wearer can then attempt to cast _modify memory_ on the same target to change its memory of either the actions the target performed while dominated or the attempted domination (Will DC 17 negates)."
