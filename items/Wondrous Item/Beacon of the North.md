Title: "Beacon of the North"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "90000 gp"
Weight: "4 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "17"
Aura: "strong conjuration"
Description: |
  "The _Beacon of the North_ is a ship's lantern that appears to be an unusually large bullseye lantern. Activating any of its powers requires a special lamp oil made only by the White Witches of Irrisen. It can hold enough oil to burn for 8 hours. When lit, the lantern burns with a cold light, and if the burning oil is used as a weapon, it deals cold damage instead of fire damage.
  As a standard action, the wielder can focus the lantern's beam of light on a single living creature as a ranged touch attack. Doing so consumes 1 minute's worth of oil and creates a small portal from the frozen north to the interior of the target's body. The target takes 1d6 points of cold damage and suffers frostbite and hypothermia (treat the target as fatigued until all nonlethal damage is healed; see page 442 of the _Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook_). Any creature that dies from the cold damage caused by the Beacon rises the following midnight as a draugr (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2_ 110).
  Also as a standard action, the beacon's user can focus the lantern's light on a depiction of a specific ship, which creates a 5-foot-wide portal connecting the depiction to the main mast of the ship itself. Any creature that touches one side of the portal instantly appears at the other. These portals appear as shimmering, blue-white patches of light; it's impossible to see what is on the other side. The portals remain open as long as the lantern is lit, even if it no longer shines directly on the depiction.
  Finally, if the _Beacon of the North_ is lit and hung on the prow of any ship, a ship-sized portal appears before the ship, allowing the ship to sail through it. This portal always leads to Whitethrone harbor in Irrisen. This function immediately closes any other portals previously opened by the lantern.
  Creating a portal of any size consumes 10 minutes' worth of oil."
