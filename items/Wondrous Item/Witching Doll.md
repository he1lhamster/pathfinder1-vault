Price: "30000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "moderate abjuration"
Description: |
  "A spellcaster binds herself to a _witching doll_ through an hour-long ritual in which the owner stitches some of her hair and fingernails into the rag doll's mouth. Thereafter, the owner can concentrate to see and hear as if she were the doll for up to 1 hour at a time; doing so leaves the owner blind and deaf to her body's immediate surroundings. While concentrating, the spellcaster imparts a modicum of animation to the doll, allowing it to turn its head, gesture, and speak in hushed whispers. Extraordinary senses such as darkvision function through this link, but magical senses such as _arcane eye_ and _detect magic_ do not. Once per day, the owner can cast a single spell with a range of touch or greater from the _witching doll_ instead of herself. Many hags use this ability to make a _witching doll_ seem mundane by casting _magic aura_, or they transform it into a distant minion with _animate object_."
