Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate evocation"
Description: |
  "This small stone figurine depicts a mummiform servant holding carved tools in its crossed arms. It appears similar to the funerary figurines called ushabti frequently found buried with the deceased in Osirian tombs.
  Upon command, an _ushabti of the willing servant_ conjures a ghostly attendant that performs simple duties or manual labor at its owner's behest, as an _unseen servant_. The ghostly attendant remains for 1 hour at a time, and cannot move farther than 30 feet from its ushabti.
  If the ushabti's owner inscribes his or her own name on the figurine (which requires a successful DC 10 Craft [sculpture] or [stonecarving] check), the _ushabti of the willing servant_ gains an additional power. While it can still summon an _unseen servant_, the owner can command the ushabti to instead summon a ghostly warrior to fight and defend its owner. This warrior functions as a _spiritual ally_ (_Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide_ 246) armed with a flail for 7 rounds. Once an _ushabti of the willing servant_ has been used to conjure a _spiritual ally_ in this way, the ushabti loses all of its magic, becoming only a mundane figurine."
