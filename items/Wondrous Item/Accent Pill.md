Description: |
  "This small, white pill has the consistency of a toughened almond. When consumed on its own, an _accent pill_ has no effect on the creature ingesting it. To function, the pill must first be coated with the blood or saliva of a living creature. Once coated, the pill turns from white to a dull brown. Consuming a coated pill grants the consuming creature the exact tone and speech mannerisms of the creature whose blood or saliva was used to coat the pill. When used as part of a disguise, it grants the consumer a +15 bonus on Disguise checks to fool a listener into thinking the speaker is the creature whose blood or saliva coated the pill; as with _vocal alteration_, this bonus applies only to someone hearing the voice without seeing the speaker. This effect lasts for 24 hours."
