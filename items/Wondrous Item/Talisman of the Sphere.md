Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "16"
Aura: "strong transmutation"
Description: |
  "This small adamantine loop and handle is typically fitted with a fine adamantine chain so that it can be worn as a necklace. A _talisman of the sphere_ is worse than useless to those unable to cast arcane spells. Characters who cannot cast arcane spells take 5d6 points of damage merely from picking up and holding a talisman of this sort. However, when held by an arcane spellcaster who is concentrating on control of a _sphere of annihilation_, a _talisman of the sphere_ doubles the character's modifier on his control check (doubling both his Intelligence bonus and his character level for this purpose).
  If the wielder of a talisman establishes control, he needs to check for maintaining control only every other round thereafter. If control is not established, the sphere moves toward him. Note that while many spells and effects of cancellation have no effect upon a _sphere of annihilation_, the talisman's power of control can be suppressed or canceled."
Destruction: |
  "A _talisman of the sphere_ can be destroyed only by throwing the item into a _sphere of annihilation_."

### Description

This small adamantine loop and handle is typically fitted with a fine adamantine chain so that it can be worn as a necklace. A _[[items/Wondrous Item/Talisman of the Sphere|talisman of the sphere]]_ is worse than useless to those unable to cast arcane spells. Characters who cannot cast arcane spells take 5d6 points of damage merely from picking up and holding a talisman of this sort. However, when held by an arcane spellcaster who is concentrating on control of a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Sphere of Annihilation|sphere of annihilation]]_, a _talisman of the sphere_ doubles the character's modifier on his control check (doubling both his Intelligence bonus and his character level for this purpose).

If the wielder of a talisman establishes control, he needs to check for maintaining control only every other round thereafter. If control is not established, the sphere moves toward him. Note that while many spells and effects of cancellation have no effect upon a _sphere of annihilation_, the talisman's power of control can be suppressed or canceled.

### _[[spells/Destruction|Destruction]]_

A _talisman of the sphere_ can be destroyed only by _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Throwing|throwing]]_ the item into a _sphere of annihilation_.
