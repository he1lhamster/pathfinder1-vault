Price: "25200 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Body"
Caster level: "10"
Aura: "moderate illusion, moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "This iridescent kilt seems stitched together from thousands of tiny scales. When an aquatic creature with a tail dons the _shimmering kilt_, her tail transforms into legs and feet, allowing her to walk on land. The wearer loses her swim speed but gains a base land speed of 30 feet (or 20 feet if the wearer is Small or smaller). This transformation lasts until the _shimmering kilt_ is removed.
  As a standard action, the wearer can cause the shimmering kilt to take on the appearance of any suitable garb that covers the legs, such as trousers or a long skirt. The shimmering kilt retains all its properties, including its weight, when so disguised. Only _true seeing_ or similar magic reveals the true nature of the _shimmering kilt_ when it is disguised."
