Title: "Skull of Ydersius"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "–"
Weight: "150 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "30"
Aura: "overwhelming universal"
Description: |
  "More than just a powerful artifact, the _Skull of Ydersius_ is the actual skull of a deity, the vessel through which the much-diminished god of serpents perceives and influences existence. Ydersius's clerics still receive spells from their prayers, granted by the skull regardless of its location or ownership. There is no way a mortal can block this effect. Possession of the skull grants several abilities.
  _Blessing of Scales_: All reptilian creatures (including worshipers of Ydersius, sorcerers with the serpentine or draconic bloodline, and druids wild-shaped into reptilian forms) within 160 feet of the _Skull of Ydersius_ gain spell resistance 25 and fast healing 10.
  _Unholy Aura_: The skull treats the 80-foot-radius area around it as though an _unhallow_ spell had been cast with the _Skull of Ydersius_ as the point of origin. This effect carries with it two linked spells that affect only worshipers of Ydersius (_death ward_ and _freedom of movement_), and two linked spells that affect all non-worshipers of Ydersius (_bane_ and _dimensional anchor_).
  _Voice of the Serpent_: Once per day, a creature that touches the skull may cast _commune_ to speak with Ydersius. A non-worshiper of Ydersius who uses this power must make a successful DC 25 Will save each time the power is used to avoid succumbing to a _feeblemind_ spell.
  Any good-aligned creature that carries the _Skull of Ydersius_, even via an extradimensional space such as a _portable hole_, gains three negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the skull is carried and disappear when the skull is released. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the skull is carried. A creature that suffers from these negative levels has a 50% spell failure chance on all divine spellcasting attempts."
Destruction: |
  "The only way to destroy the _Skull of Ydersius_ is to reunite it with Ydersius's mindless, decapitated body. Doing so returns Ydersius to life, though in a weakened state. This manifestation can be combated and even slain, though it regenerates from nearly any wound short of re-decapitation. For an instant, before the whole body begins to regenerate, Ydersius's spirit is untethered from his form. If Ydersius is dragged to the Boneyard and slain in Pharasma's presence, the goddess of death can judge the serpent god, causing his body and skull to disintegrate to dust."
