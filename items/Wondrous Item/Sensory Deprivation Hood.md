Title: "Sensory Deprivation Hood"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "27500 gp"
Weight: "5 lbs."
Slot: "Head"
Caster level: "10"
Aura: "moderate divination"
Description: |
  "This especially heavy leather hoodwink cowl (see page 249) is designed to quiet the wearer's mundane senses, allowing him to focus on his supernatural senses. Donning or removing the hood requires 1 minute, or 5 rounds with assistance.
  As with a normal hoodwink cowl, the wearer of a _sensory deprivation hood_ is blinded, deafened, and takes a –10 penalty on all other Perception checks. If the wearer has blindsense, blindsight, tremorsense, or a similar ability, he can take a full-round action to suppress those senses for as long as he wears the hood or until he resumes using them (which requires another full-round action). If the wearer is currently benefitting from one of these senses, he gains no benefits from the hood.
  As long as the wearer's senses are suppressed, he gains the ability to perform automatic writing, dowsing, and psychometry even if he doesn't have psychic spellcasting or the Psychic Sensitivity feat. If he does have psychic spellcasting or the Psychic Sensitivity feat, he gains a +5 bonus on skill checks for those skill unlocks.
  Additionally, once per day while wearing the _sensory deprivation hood_, the wearer can open up his mind to passing spiritual phenomena in the hope of gaining greater insight into a specific issue. This functions as _contact other plane_, allowing the wearer to ask up to 5 questions per use, but rather than contacting an entity on another plane of existence, the wearer contacts a nearby spirit or other psychic entity. Rather than using the information for one of the planes listed in the spell, this effect uses the following information: _Avoid Int/Cha Decrease_ DC 10/24 hours; _True Answer_ 01–34; _Don't Know_ 35–62; _Lie_ 63–83; _Random Answer_ 84–100. Unlike with contact other plane, the wearer can attempt either an Intelligence check or a Charisma check to avoid the Intelligence and Charisma decrease."
