Price: "8000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Hands"
Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate conjuration"
Description: |
  "This elbow-length, heavy leather glove's fine embroidery is marred by dozens of claw marks. Once per day on command, its wearer can gesture toward a creature within 30 feet. When he does, a featureless silhouette of a bird of prey appears, swoops toward the target, and performs a disarm or steal combat maneuver (wearer's choice, CMB +16). The shadow falcon is a magical effect, not a creature, and this action does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If the hand wearing the glove is empty, the shadow falcon brings the item to the wearer's hand. If the gloved hand is occupied, the shadow falcon deposits the item on the ground in an unoccupied space adjacent to the wearer. The shadow falcon then disappears."

### Description

This elbow-length, heavy leather glove's fine embroidery is marred by dozens of claw marks. Once per day on _[[spells/Command|command]]_, its wearer can gesture toward a creature within 30 feet. When he does, a featureless silhouette of a bird of prey appears, swoops toward the target, and performs a disarm or steal combat maneuver (wearer's choice, CMB +16). The _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|shadow]]_ falcon is a magical effect, not a creature, and this action does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If the hand wearing the glove is empty, the _shadow_ falcon brings the item to the wearer's hand. If the gloved hand is occupied, the _shadow_ falcon deposits the item on the ground in an unoccupied space adjacent to the wearer. The _shadow_ falcon then disappears.
