This effect lasts for 1 minute, during which the wearer can roll twice and use the higher result for all Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based skill checks. The wearer can activate this ability after such a skill check has been rolled but before the result is determined, allowing for a reroll.
  Additionally, once per day as an immediate action, the wearer can gain the benefits of _tower of iron will V_, as the possessing spirit rises to block any mental effects against the wearer. This ability can be used regardless of whether the miter's other ability is active."
