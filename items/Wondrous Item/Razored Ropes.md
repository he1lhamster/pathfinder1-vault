Description: |
  "A _razored rope_ is a _+1 lasso_ made out of tightly braided lengths of fine chain, used to help restrain cowards attempting to flee a battle. It can be used to entangle an opponent as normal, but deals 1d4 points of damage to a creature that attempts to slip free and fails. The _razored rope_ is also more difficult to escape from, requiring a DC 18 Escape Artist check to slip free from and a DC 28 Strength check to break.
  If Gorum is your patron, as a standard action you can cause the lasso to constrict around a creature already entangled by the rope, dealing 1d4 points of damage. If Gorum is not your patron and you attempt to make the lasso constrict, it lashes up and strikes you for 1d4 points of damage."
