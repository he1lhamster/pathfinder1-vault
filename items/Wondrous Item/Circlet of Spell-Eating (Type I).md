Description: |
  "Iridescent whorls and runes in a flowing eldritch script adorn this golden circlet. The circlet functions as a _ring of spell knowledge_, allowing a spontaneous caster to learn and store an additional arcane spell. However, once the circlet has been worn for 1d6 days, the wearer must succeed at a DC 16 Will save each day when meditating to renew her spell slots. Failure indicates that she loses knowledge of a random spell, whose level cannot exceed the maximum level of the _circlet of spell-eating_. Knowledge of this spell is lost until the circlet is removed, returning at a rate of one spell per day, beginning with the lowest-level spell forgotten.
  So long as the _circlet of spell-eating_ has caused its wearer to forget at least one spell, its creator can cast the first spell lost to the item once per day as a spell-like ability."
