  "The warped clay sphere of this _+1 fuse grenade_ (_Ultimate Equipment_ 107) is painted with a crimson bull's-eye symbol and its fuse is dyed red. An unerring grenade can be lit as a move action and thrown like a splash weapon. An unerring grenade veers toward its target, whether a creature or a grid intersection, negating any miss chances that would otherwise apply, such as from concealment. The thrower still has to aim at the right square or grid intersection. An _unerring grenade_ otherwise functions as a normal fuse grenade (Reflex DC 16 half)."
