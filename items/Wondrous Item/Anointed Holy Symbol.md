  "This hollow holy symbol includes a reservoir meant to contain a dose of holy water. When the reservoir is filled on the home plane of its corresponding deity with a dose of holy water as a full-round action, the symbol becomes charged with additional power. Each time a filled _anointed holy symbol_ is used to channel energy, the user can use the standard form of channel energy or use variant channeling based on one aspect of her deity's portfolio, selected each time the _anointed holy symbol_ is used. The user cannot apply more than one variant channeling ability to her channeled energy at one time. An _anointed holy symbol_ remains charged for 3 days, after which time the holy water within is consumed and the reservoir is empty again.
  _Anointed unholy symbols_ also exist for evil deities; they must be filled with unholy water to function but otherwise operate just as an _anointed holy symbol_."
