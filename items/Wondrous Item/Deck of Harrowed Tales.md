  "The _Deck of Harrowed Tales_ is a unique Harrow deck linked to the Harrowed Realm, a fantastical demiplane populated by whimsical and nefarious manifestations of characters from a Harrow deck's illustrations (see the sidebar for more details on this realm). Once per day, at a mental command from its wielder, the _Deck of Harrowed Tales_ can create a swirling vortex to the Harrowed Realm, as per the spell _gate_. This ability does not function while the deck is in the Harrowed Realm, requiring those within to find another method of escape. The Harrowed Realm is detailed in _Pathfinder Module: The Harrowing_."
Destruction: |
  "The _Deck of Harrowed Tales_ can only be destroyed by completing a mythical series of 54 quests tied to each of the Harrow cards within. Only then can the final 55th quest be revealed, upon the completion of which the deck and the Harrowed Realm cease to exist."
