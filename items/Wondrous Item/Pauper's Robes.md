Description: |
  "Dirt and grime from city streets cling to these dirty brown robes, covering them in an ever-present film of filth. A set of _pauper's robes_ surrounds its wearer in mystery, making it difficult for creatures to remember details about him. Creatures that attempt to remember details of their interactions with the wearer of a set of _pauper's robes_ must make a successful Will save to do so: recalling general details about the wearer (such as gender or race) requires a successful DC 13 Will save, and recalling more specific information (such as name, distinguishing features, or mannerisms) requires a successful DC 16 Will save. If the wearer of the robes takes any action that counts as an attack (as defined by the _invisibility_ spell), creatures witnessing that action are immune to the memory-fogging influence of the _pauper's robes_ for all interactions with the wearer over the next 24 hours.
  As a standard action, the wearer of a set of _pauper's robes_ can cause the garment to tarnish and dirty any valuables he carries, making jewelry appear to be little more than beads and twine or a magical sword look rusted and dull. Anyone who examines or interacts with such an object can see through the guise with a successful DC 13 Will save. This effect ends immediately once the object leaves the wearer's possession."
