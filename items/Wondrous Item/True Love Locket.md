Description: |
  "These gold, heart-shaped pendants, which open to reveal small hollows inside, always come in pairs and must be on the same plane of existence to function. When two people with a strong emotional bond (such as good friends, family members, or lovers) each wear one of the lockets containing a keepsake from the other person (usually a lock of hair or small picture), the lockets' magic becomes evident. After 24 hours of wearing a linked locket, each wearer knows the condition of the other, as a constant status spell. In addition, when either wearer uses the aid another action to assist the wearer of the linked locket, the bonus gained is increased by 1. Lastly, once per day, each wearer may use one of the known skills of the wearer of the linked locket, as _borrow skill_ (_Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide_ 207). If either wearer of a linked true love locket takes the pendant off, has it forcefully removed, is killed, or travels to another plane, both lockets cease to function until re-attuned after 24 hours."
