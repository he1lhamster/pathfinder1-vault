Price: "35000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Body"
Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate abjuration"
Description: |
  "Spun from combed cotton, this simple, unassuming gown bears a strong aura of witchcraft. These magical garments are highly sought after by witches, for though anyone may wear a _witching gown_, only a witch may realize its full potential. A _witching gown_ grants its wearer a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws and a +2 competence bonus on all Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate skill checks. When worn by a witch, these bonuses double.
  In addition, a witch may change the appearance and style of the gown to match her whims (as the glamered armor special ability) and adopt virtually any disguise, gaining a +10 bonus on Disguise checks that incorporate the gown's appearance. Only a true seeing spell or similar magic can pierce this effect.
  Lastly, a witch may cast a single touch range spell of 4th level or lower into the gown. Thereafter, the gown holds the magic for up to 24 hours, functioning as a spite spell against the next foe to strike the witch with a successful melee attack or combat maneuver. The gown's spite spell counts as an active spite effect for the witch wearing the gown."
