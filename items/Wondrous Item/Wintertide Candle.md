Title: "Wintertide Candle"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "1500 gp"
Weight: "0.5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "Even though this translucent, 1-foot-long candle resembles an icicle, it refuses to melt when exposed to any normal heat source. When lit, the candle transmutes its material composition from wax into gleaming divine ice (frozen holy water like that produced by _holy ice_). The flame of the candle is cool and radiates violet-blue light. Lighting the candle is a standard action, and anyone adjacent to it can extinguish the flame as a free action. The candle can burn for 10 rounds (need not be consecutive) before the ice is entirely consumed.
  While the candle is burning, it emits an aura of divine cold in a 30-foot radius. The candle modifies the effect of any channeled positive or negative energy that originates inside the aura, and of any cure or inflict spell cast inside the aura. Instead of their normal effects, these abilities deal an amount of cold damage equal to the number of hit points they would normally cure or inflict. A target that succeeds at a Fortitude save (using the normal DC for the ability or spell) instead takes half damage.
  A bearer can hurl the lit candle at an enemy as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet, causing the candle to explode into a burst of chilled holy water. A creature struck in this manner is numbed by divine cold, becoming staggered for half the remaining time that the candle could burn (Fortitude DC 17 negates). An undead creature or evil outsider struck in this manner also takes 1d4 points of damage for each remaining round that the candle could continue burning, as if it were hit by holy water (no saving throw)."

##### Magical properties

**Caster level:** 9 **Aura:** moderate transmutation

### Description

Even though this translucent, 1-foot-long _[[items/Mundane/Candle|candle]]_ resembles an icicle, it refuses to melt when exposed to any normal _[[universal monster rules/Heat|heat]]_ source. When lit, the _candle_ transmutes its material composition from wax into gleaming divine ice (frozen _[[items/Mundane/Holy water|holy water]]_ like that produced by _[[spells/Holy Ice|holy ice]]_). The flame of the _candle_ is cool and radiates violet-blue light. Lighting the _candle_ is a standard action, and anyone adjacent to it can extinguish the flame as a free action. The _candle_ can _[[universal monster rules/Burn|burn]]_ for 10 rounds (need not be consecutive) before the ice is entirely consumed.

While the _candle_ is _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Burning|burning]]_, it emits an aura of divine cold in a 30-foot radius. The _candle_ modifies the effect of any channeled positive or negative energy that originates inside the aura, and of any cure or inflict spell cast inside the aura. Instead of their normal effects, these abilities deal an amount of cold damage equal to the number of hit points they would normally cure or inflict. A target that succeeds at a Fortitude save (using the normal DC for the ability or spell) instead takes half damage.

A bearer can hurl the lit _candle_ at an enemy as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet, causing the _candle_ to explode into a burst of chilled _holy water_. A creature struck in this manner is numbed by divine cold, becoming _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for half the remaining time that the _candle_ could _burn_ (Fortitude DC 17 negates). An undead creature or evil outsider struck in this manner also takes 1d4 points of damage for each remaining round that the _candle_ could continue _burning_, as if it were hit by _holy water_ (no saving throw).
