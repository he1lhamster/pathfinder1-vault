Description: |
  "Originally invented by shamans of the Kellid tribes of the Realms of the Mammoth Lords, _zoic fetishes_ have spread throughout the Inner Sea region and are much sought after in any area where dangerous animals dwell. Each _zoic fetish_ looks different, but is essentially a small fetish made from bone, branches, grass, and twine crafted into one of several shapes—a mammal, a bird, a reptile, an amphibian, or a fish.
  As long as a creature carries a _zoic fetish_, it is somewhat protected against attacks from animals, gaining a +1 insight bonus to AC against all animals. In addition, possession of a _zoic fetish_ grants a +4 insight bonus on wild empathy checks. Finally, once per day, the wielder can present a _zoic fetish_ to an animal of the same classification as the fetish (amphibian, bird, fish, mammal, or reptile) to use _dominate animal_ on that creature."
