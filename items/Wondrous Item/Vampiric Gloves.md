Description: |
  "These pale, elegant-looking leather gloves have bloodred stitching on the fingers—which bears a startling resemblance to blood-encrusted fingernails. Three times per day, the wearer can use _vampiric touch_ and _bleed_. If the wearer uses _vampiric touch_ and holds the charge, the charge dissipates if the gloves are removed.
  Though _vampiric touch_ is normally a touch attack, the wearer may instead use that ability as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet, but only against a dying target or a target suffering from a bleed effect. When using _vampiric touch_ in this way, the wearer may hold the charge on a missed ranged touch attack.
  If the wearer is suffering from a bleed effect, he may expend one use of _vampiric touch_ to end the bleed effect."
