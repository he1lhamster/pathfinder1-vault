Description: |
  "This versatile wooden conveyance provides a safe refuge for its passengers, free from the prying eyes of others. A _private palanquin_ can be commanded to change its appearance, including not only its decorations and appointments but also its physical form, taking the shape of an enclosed litter, two-wheeled cart, fourwheeled light or heavy wagon, carriage, or even a small cabin, though in all shapes it retains the dimensions of a Large object occupying a 10-foot cube. When activated, a _private palanquin_ moves on its own, following its passengers' directions, and has the following statistics: **hp** 150; **hardness** 8; **Speed** 40 ft.; **AC** 18 (–1 size, +9 natural); **Attack** none; **CMD** 24; **Fort** +2, **Ref** +2, **Will** +2.
  Once per day, a _private palanquin_ can be commanded to create a set of illusory draft animals or litter bearers that last for 12 hours or until dismissed. These creatures look, sound, feel, and smell just like real creatures of their type, and they appear to move the _private palanquin_. Up to four Medium creatures (or a single Large creature) can fit inside a _private palanquin_, and creatures inside it are protected from observation, both mundane and magical, as if in a _mage's private sanctum_. The door to a _private palanquin_ is locked, as per _arcane lock_, but opens with a command word. If the door is opened without speaking the command word, it triggers an audible _alarm_."
