Title: "Parley Ward"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "52000 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "11"
Aura: "moderate abjuration"
Description: |
  "This hemispherical dome of jet-black crystal has no discernible markings on its curved surface, but faint runes (including the command word) are visible on the flat side. Three times per week, whenever it is placed flat side down and the command word is spoken, the _parley ward_ hums and projects a black dome-shaped field that slowly expands for 1 minute and then finally snaps into place, covering up to a 30-foot-radius area, though the area can be reduced and shaped to encompass the interior of a room or structure (such as a meeting hall or pavilion) in order to make it less obvious to those on the outside. The affected area becomes a protected zone that provides complete privacy, preventing sound, light, and divination and scrying spells from penetrating, as per the _mage's private sanctum_ spell. Additionally, the protected zone discourages any creatures within from committing deliberate hostile acts, as though they were affected by the _serenity_ spell (with no save allowed). Each use of the magic of the _parley ward_ can function for up to 24 hours, or until the user deactivates it. Once the _parley ward_ is activated, neither the item nor its zone can be moved; attempting to do so deactivates it, consuming one of its 3 weekly charges."
