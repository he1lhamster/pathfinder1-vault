Description: |
  "A _thrum of the hidden soul_ appears as a single, unbreakable crimson thread. To use the thrum, you tie the thread around any Fine or smaller nonmagical object and will your soul into the marked object. The thread disintegrates and your soul transfers into the marked object as if it were a _magic jar_, leaving your body alive but catatonic. You cannot move your body or use its senses. You can remain within the _magic jar_ for an unlimited amount of time, but cannot sense your surroundings or possess any other living creature. You may return to your original body at will. If your body is slain, you may only escape the _magic jar_ if your body is resurrected or else a _wish_, _miracle_, or similar effect is used to restore you.
  While within the _magic jar_, your soul is shielded from divination attempts. Spells such as _scrying_ show the location of your corpse, and spells such as _divination_ return information consistent with your body's death. While your soul inhabits it, the _magic jar_ appears non-magical to divination magic, including _detect magic_, _identify_, and _legend lore_."
