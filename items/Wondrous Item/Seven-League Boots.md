The steps functions as teleportation with a 21-mile range, except the wearer must have an uninterrupted path to her intended destination, though this path doesn't have to follow a straight line. Harmful environments between the wearer and the destination cause her no harm.
  If the wearer's path is blocked, her travel ends just short of the obstacle blocking her. If she tries to step too far, she appears in the closest available space to her destination without going beyond 21 miles of where she started."
