Title: "Lambent Window"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "20000 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate divination"
Description: |
  "This small pane of glass in a frame made of black metal looks like a small hand mirror at first glance, but when a creature spends at least 1 minute staring into its reflection, the image shifts and changes, showing the landscape of another plane. If the _lambent window_ is activated on the Material Plane, it shows the corresponding location on the Shadow Plane, along with any creatures at that location. Likewise, when used on the Shadow Plane, it shows the corresponding location on the Material Plane. This item only allows those staring into it to see the corresponding location on the other plane; they cannot hear through or gain other sensual information about the other side by way of the window. This effect can be used for up to 10 minutes per day. Those minutes need not be consecutive, and the 1 minute it takes to activate the _lambent window_ does not count against this limit.
  A person holding an active _lambent window_ can use it as a special focus when casting _plane shift_ or using _plane shift_ as a spell-like ability to reach the specific location shown in the mirror, rather than 5–500 miles from the bearer's intended destination."

### Description

This small pane of glass in a frame made of black metal looks like a small hand _[[items/Mundane/Mirror|mirror]]_ at first glance, but when a creature spends at least 1 minute staring into its reflection, the image shifts and changes, showing the landscape of another plane. If the _[[items/Wondrous Item/Lambent Window|lambent window]]_ is activated on the Material Plane, it shows the corresponding location on the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|Shadow]]_ Plane, along with any creatures at that location. Likewise, when used on the _Shadow_ Plane, it shows the corresponding location on the Material Plane. This item only allows those staring into it to see the corresponding location on the other plane; they cannot hear through or gain other sensual information about the other side by way of the window. This effect can be used for up to 10 minutes per day. Those minutes need not be consecutive, and the 1 minute it takes to activate the _lambent window_ does not count against this limit.

A person holding an active _lambent window_ can use it as a special focus when casting _[[spells/Plane Shift|plane shift]]_ or using _plane shift_ as a spell-like ability to reach the specific location shown in the _mirror_, rather than 5–500 miles from the bearer's intended destination.
