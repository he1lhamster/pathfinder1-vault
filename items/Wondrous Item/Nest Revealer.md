Description: |
  "This small vial is sealed with a fine metal cap engraved with the visage of a noble hound. When a few drops of a creature's blood are placed in the vial, it begins to fill on its own, replicating the creature's blood over the span of 1 minute. After 1 minute, the vial shatters and a small fist-sized orb of crystallized blood falls to the ground. This animate orb rolls in the direction of the last location in which the source creature slept for at least 1 hour. The blood travels at a rate of 20 feet per round and can travel up to 10 miles over the span of 5 hours. If the orb does not reach the creature's nest within 5 hours, it collapses into a puddle containing enough blood to activate another _nest revealer_."
