Description: |
  "The entirety of this thick hide belt is scarred with impressions of fiendish visages, each shifting between a scowl and a smile. Commonly used by the servants of Asmodeus in Cheliax, this belt grants its wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution. Treat this Constitution bonus as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn.
  Whenever an enemy scores a critical hit against the wearer, the wearer gains fast healing 1 for 1 minute. This ability doesn't trigger if the critical hit deals only nonlethal damage. Damage caused by silver weapons, good-aligned weapons, or spells or effects with the good descriptor doesn't trigger the fast healing, and suppresses the fast healing for 1 round if it's already active.
  The wearer of an _infernal cord_ can be detected as though she were an evil creature, and can sense the item's evil while wearing it. This belt imparts 1 negative level to any nonevil creature that wears it until the belt is removed.
  **Greater Infernal Cord**: This item functions as an _infernal cord_, but it grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution, and the fast healing effect increases to fast healing 4. Treat the Constitution bonus as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn.
  The wearer can be detected as though she were an evil cleric, not just an evil creature."
