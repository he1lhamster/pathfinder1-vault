Price: "44000 gp"
Weight: "15 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Cursed: "True"
Caster level: "17"
Aura: "strong conjuration"
Description: |
  "This bag appears to be an ordinary sack. Detection for magical properties makes it seem as if it were a _bag of holding_. The sack, however, is something entirely different and more insidious—one of the feeding orifices of an extradimensional creature.
  Any substance of animal or vegetable nature is subject to "swallowing'' if thrust within the bag. The _bag of devouring_ is 90% likely to ignore any initial intrusion, but anytime thereafter that it senses living flesh within (such as if someone reaches into the bag to pull something out), it is 60% likely to close around the offending appendage and attempt to draw the whole victim in. The bag has a +8 bonus on combat maneuver checks made to grapple. If it pins a creature, it pulls the victim inside as a free action. The bag has a CMD of 18 for those attempting to break free.
  The bag can hold up to 30 cubic feet of matter. It acts as a _bag of holding type I_, but each hour it has a 5% cumulative chance of swallowing the contents and then spitting the stuff out in some nonspace or on some other plane. Creatures drawn within are consumed in 1 round. The bag destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a _wish_, _miracle_, or _true resurrection_ spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic."

### Description

This bag appears to be an ordinary _[[items/Mundane/Sack|sack]]_. Detection for magical properties makes it seem as if it were a bag of holding. The _sack_, however, is something entirely different and more insidious—one of the feeding orifices of an extradimensional creature.

Any substance of animal or vegetable nature is subject to "swallowing'' if thrust within the bag. The _[[items/Wondrous Item/Bag of Devouring|bag of devouring]]_ is 90% likely to ignore any initial intrusion, but anytime thereafter that it senses living flesh within (such as if someone reaches into the bag to _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ something out), it is 60% likely to close around the offending appendage and attempt to draw the whole victim in. The bag has a +8 bonus on combat maneuver checks made to grapple. If it pins a creature, it pulls the victim inside as a free action. The bag has a CMD of 18 for those attempting to break free.

The bag can hold up to 30 cubic feet of matter. It acts as a bag of holding type I, but each hour it has a 5% cumulative chance of swallowing the contents and then spitting the stuff out in some nonspace or on some other plane. Creatures drawn within are consumed in 1 round. The bag destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or _[[spells/Resurrection|resurrection]]_ that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_, _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_, or _[[spells/True Resurrection|true resurrection]]_ spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.
