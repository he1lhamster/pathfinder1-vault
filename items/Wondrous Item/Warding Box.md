Description: |
  "A _warding box_ is a powerful magical container built to obscure and confound any attempt to locate objects kept inside. The box can hold one object no larger than 8 inches by 8 inches by 3 inches (or up to 25 pounds) in each of its three compartments at any one time. The box's lid and additional compartments are sealed, but the box can be opened or closed as a full-round action. While the lid is closed, the _warding box_ and all objects inside it are protected from all divination spells. In this state, no divination spell save for those employed by the gods can detect the _warding box_ or its contents."
Destruction: |
  "A _warding box_ can be destroyed by placing a _portable hole_ inside it, closing the lid, and then placing the box inside a second _portable hole_. This second _portable hole_ must be closed, and then a _wish_ must be used to switch the two _portable holes_. Doing so destroys both _portable holes_ and the _warding box_ along with them."
