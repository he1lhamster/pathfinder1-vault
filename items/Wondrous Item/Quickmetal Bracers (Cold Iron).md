Title: "Quickmetal Bracers (Cold Iron)"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "2000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Wrists"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "Once per day when a user wearing both these bracers speaks a command word, the metal turns entirely liquid and swims over the wearer's hands to cover her weapons. The user can cover a two-handed melee weapon or up to two one-handed or light melee weapons. For the next 10 rounds, the affected weapons can overcome damage reduction as though the weapons were made of adamantine, cold iron, or silver (as determined by the _quickmetal bracers'_ type).
  The heavy, shifting metal coating affects the balance of manufactured weapons, imposing a –2 penalty on attack rolls. Improvised weapons, however, are already unwieldy, and the metal coating doesn't significantly affect their balance. If the wielder lets go of a weapon affected by the bracers, the liquid metal immediately turns back into a solid metal bracer— or bracers, in the case of a two-handed weapon—reappearing on the user's wrists. The bracers cannot therefore affect thrown weapons or ranged weapon ammunition."

### Description

Once per day when a user wearing both these bracers speaks a _[[spells/Command|command]]_ word, the metal turns entirely liquid and swims over the wearer's hands to cover her weapons. The user can cover a two-handed melee weapon or up to two one-handed or light melee weapons.

The heavy, shifting metal coating affects the balance of manufactured weapons, imposing a –2 penalty on attack rolls. Improvised weapons, however, are already unwieldy, and the metal coating doesn't significantly affect their balance. If the wielder lets go of a weapon affected by the bracers, the liquid metal immediately turns back into a solid metal bracer— or bracers, in the case of a two-handed weapon—reappearing on the user's wrists. The bracers cannot therefore affect thrown weapons or ranged weapon ammunition.
