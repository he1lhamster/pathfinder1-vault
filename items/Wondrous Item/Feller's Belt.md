Description: |
  "The secret weapons of the Lumber Consortium's enforcers throughout Andoran, these belts nominally appear as expensive but effective aids for felling trees, but are instead used by the Consortium's enforcers. A creature wearing a _feller's belt_ gains +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks to sunder wooden objects, ignores any hardness possessed by wooden objects, and bypasses the damage reduction of any creatures of the plant or fey type. A creature wearing a _feller's belt_ for over 24 hours doubles the critical threat range of any held axe, as though that weapon possessed the _keen_ weapon special ability. This benefit lasts for as long as the belt is worn, and doesn't stack with any other effects that expand the critical threat range of a weapon (such as _keen edge_ or the Improved Critical feat)."
