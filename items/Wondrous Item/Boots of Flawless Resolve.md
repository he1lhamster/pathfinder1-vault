Title: "Boots of Flawless Resolve"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "6500 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Feet"
Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate divination"
Description: |
  "These knee-high white leather boots are covered in delicate lines of gemstones and precious metals that are almost imperceptible to the average human eye. Three times per day as a move action, the wearer can declare a single creature within 30 feet as his target. The wearer gains a +2 insight bonus to AC against the target's attacks and a +4 bonus to CMD against combat maneuvers the target attempts against him. This effect lasts for up to 7 rounds, but it ends immediately if the wearer takes any move action that would move him out of his square (not including a 5-foot step, but including movement such as flying) or if he is moved out of his square involuntarily, such as by a successful bull rush combat maneuver that pushes him backward. If the target dies, the effect immediately ends, and declaring a new target requires expending another use. If the wearer declares a new target before the effect on the previous target ends, the effect on the previous target ends immediately, and declaring the new target expends another use."
