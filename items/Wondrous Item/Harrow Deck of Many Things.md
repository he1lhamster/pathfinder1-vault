Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "–"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "20"
Aura: "strong universal"
Description: |
  "A _Harrow Deck of Many Things_ is usually found wrapped in cloth or velvet and hidden away within a simple wooden case, but nothing marks it as being anything other than an oft-used and treasured focus of the Varisian fortune-telling art. As soon as one of the deck's cards is drawn at random, though, its nature becomes apparent and an effect determined by the chosen card is bestowed upon the user—often to life-altering effect.
  A bearer of a _Harrow Deck of Many Things_ who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards he will draw before doing so. These cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw any more cards from the deck than he announced (unless the effect of a drawn card states otherwise). If the character does not willingly draw his allotted number or is somehow prevented from doing so, the cards flip out of the deck on their own after 1 hour. Future attempts to draw cards from the deck made by someone who has already drawn his allotted number reveal only blank cards.
  Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced, making it possible to draw the same card twice. A _Harrow Deck of Many Things_ contains 54 cards, with the effects of each detailed in the following Effects of the Harrow section."
Destruction: |
  "The _Harrow Deck of Many Things_ possesses a strange sort of selfpreservation. If the deck is damaged—regardless of how much damage it takes—one card is destroyed and the deck randomly teleports somewhere else on the plane. If it is somehow pursued and damaged again within 1 minute, another card is destroyed and the deck teleports again. If this process is repeated until no cards are remaining, the deck is destroyed. If the deck is not entirely destroyed, destroyed cards reappear at a rate of 1 per hour."

### Description

A _[[items/Wondrous Item/Harrow Deck of Many Things|Harrow Deck of Many Things]]_ is usually found wrapped in cloth or velvet and hidden away within a simple wooden case, but nothing marks it as being anything other than an oft-used and treasured focus of the Varisian fortune-telling art. As soon as one of the deck's _[[items/Mundane/Cards|cards]]_ is drawn at random, though, its nature becomes apparent and an effect determined by the chosen card is bestowed upon the user—often to life-altering effect.

A bearer of a _Harrow Deck of Many Things_ who wishes to draw a card must announce how many _cards_ he will draw before doing so. These _cards_ must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw any more _cards_ from the deck than he announced (unless the effect of a drawn card states otherwise). If the character does not willingly draw his allotted number or is somehow prevented from doing so, the _cards_ flip out of the deck on their own after 1 hour. Future attempts to draw _cards_ from the deck made by someone who has already drawn his allotted number reveal only blank _cards_.

Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced, making it possible to draw the same card twice. A _Harrow Deck of Many Things_ contains 54 _cards_, with the effects of each detailed in the following Effects of the Harrow section.

If the deck is not entirely destroyed, destroyed _cards_ reappear at a rate of 1 per hour.
