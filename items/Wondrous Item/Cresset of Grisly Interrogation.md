When a head is placed inside and the command word is spoken, you can sequester information from it as if it were under the effect of a _speak with dead_ spell. The cage can coerce three answers per day, which do not need to be from the same head or asked in a limited period of time (for example, you could ask a kobold's head a question in the morning, an orc's head a question in the afternoon, and an ogre's head a question in the evening)."
