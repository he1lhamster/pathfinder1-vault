Title: "Bronze Sentinel"

Aura: "strong evocation, strong transmutation"
Description: |
  "Built by a group of forgotten arcanists and researchers in a secret outpost deep within the Osirian desert, the bronze sentinel is a magical vehicle shaped as a 15-foot-tall bronze humanoid statue, crafted in the shape of a muscular man wearing a silver headband that resembles two serpents twined together. When the sentinel is active, its eyes shine with green light and a triangle of runes on its chest glows silver.
  Close examination and a successful DC 25 Perception check reveal a secret catch that opens a hatch in the statue's back. Anyone who crawls inside finds seating for one Medium or Small occupant and eight unlabeled levers and pedals. These controls allow a character inside to activate and control the sentinel's movements and actions. Operating a lever is normally a move action, but operating the lever to extend or retract the sentinel's arms (such as to attack) is a standard action. No lever can be operated more than once per round.
