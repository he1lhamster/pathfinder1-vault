Caster level: "15"
Aura: "strong transmutation"
Description: |
  "This necklace consists of a fine gold chain from which hangs a small sealed crystal vial containing preserved liquid blood. Each ampoule is attuned to a specific sorcerer bloodline. If a sorcerer (or other creature with sorcerer bloodline powers, such as from the Eldritch Heritage feat in _Ultimate Magic_) wears the ampoule for at least one day, she loses her existing bloodline powers and gains the bloodline powers of the ampoule's bloodline, using her sorcerer level to determine the powers gained. The ampoule has no effect on the sorcerer's bonus spells, bloodline arcana, or bonus feats from her original bloodline (which remain unchanged).
  The sorcerer can only use these bloodline powers as long as she wears the necklace. Removing the necklace leaves the sorcerer unable to access any bloodline power, either her own or those of the ampoule, until one hour has passed.
  As a full round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, the wearer can break open the ampoule and drink the blood within. This destroys the item, and gives her the sickened condition for 1d4 hours. If the drinker is a sorcerer, her bloodline permanently changes to match that of the ampoule. In this case, the sorcerer's bonus spells, bloodline arcana, and bloodline powers all permanently change to match those of the ampoule's bloodline. Bonus feats previously selected due to the sorcerer's bloodline are unaffected, but new feats must be selected from the new bloodline's bonus feat list."

### Description

This necklace consists of a fine gold chain from which hangs a small sealed crystal _[[items/Mundane/Vial|vial]]_ containing preserved liquid blood. Each ampoule is attuned to a specific _[[classes/Sorcerer|sorcerer]]_ bloodline. If a _sorcerer_ (or other creature with _sorcerer_ bloodline powers, such as from the _[[feats/Eldritch Heritage|Eldritch Heritage]]_ feat in Ultimate Magic) wears the ampoule for at least one day, she loses her existing bloodline powers and gains the bloodline powers of the ampoule's bloodline, using her _sorcerer_ level to determine the powers gained. The ampoule has no effect on the _sorcerer_'s bonus spells, bloodline arcana, or bonus feats from her original bloodline (which remain unchanged).

The _sorcerer_ can only use these bloodline powers as long as she wears the necklace. Removing the necklace leaves the _sorcerer_ unable to access any bloodline power, either her own or those of the ampoule, until one hour has passed.

As a full round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, the wearer can break open the ampoule and drink the blood within. This destroys the item, and gives her the _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ condition for 1d4 hours. If the drinker is a _sorcerer_, her bloodline permanently changes to match that of the ampoule. In this case, the _sorcerer_'s bonus spells, bloodline arcana, and bloodline powers all permanently change to match those of the ampoule's bloodline. Bonus feats previously selected due to the _sorcerer_'s bloodline are unaffected, but new feats must be selected from the new bloodline's bonus feat list.
