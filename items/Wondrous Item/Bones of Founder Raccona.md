Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "2250 gp"
Weight: "8 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "4"
Aura: "faint enchantment"
Description: |
  "The _bones of Founder Raccona_ are small, blackened bone fragments, most no more than an inch long, and that radiate a faint, soothing warmth. Each bone grants the bearer 1 temporary hit point. These temporary hit points stack with other temporary hit points gained from possessing multiple _bones of Founder Raccona_, but not with those from other sources. These temporary hit points return daily at dawn. There are a total of 32 bones that bear the power of the Founder Raccona.
  In addition to granting temporary hit points, the bearer of one or more of these bones is always aware of the presence of other _bones of Founder Raccona_ within 50 feet.
  The bones also possess a mild drive to seek out their remaining pieces. Every time a character acquires a _bone of Founder Raccona_, she must make a Will save (DC 10 + the number of _bones of Founder Raccona_ in her possession). Failure causes the character to have a dream of Founder Raccona that encourages her to seek out the other bones. This dream does not force the character to act, but suggests that seeking the remaining bones would be a benevolent act. Should all 32 _bones of Founder Raccona_ ever be gathered together, they immediately crumble to dust and release Raccona's soul to the afterlife, losing all power."
