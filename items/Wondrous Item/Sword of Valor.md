Description: |
  "The Inheritor herself carried this crimson banner into battle during the Shining Crusade. An army commander who carries the _Sword of Valor_ increases the DV and OM of her army by 4 against armies of undead or evil outsiders. Yet the _Sword of Valor's_ greatest power lies not in offense but in defense. Mounted firmly upon an interior wall in a visible, public place, the _Sword of Valor_ creates a 10-mile-radius area that bars demons and those who worship demons from using teleportation spells and effects and imparts on such creatures a –4 penalty to Armor Class and on all saving throws. Once per month while the banner is mounted on a wall, a worshiper of Iomedae within 30 feet of the banner can use it to summon a planetar to protect the banner and its surroundings for 1 day. Any nonevil creature that sleeps within a 1-mile radius becomes immune to fear effects from demons and demon worshipers for 24 hours."
Destruction: |
  "The _Sword of Valor_ can be destroyed by Iomedae herself, but only if she chooses to do so and rips it apart with her bare hands."
