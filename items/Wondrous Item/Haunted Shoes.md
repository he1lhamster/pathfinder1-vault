The wearer can choose to dismiss one or more of the spirit servants early.
  Once per day, the wearer can command the ghostly spirits inside her _haunted shoes_ to emerge and swirl around her, making her difficult to target in combat. The wearer gains concealment (20% miss chance) for 3 minutes. The spirits cannot be harmed, but a _true seeing_ spell ignores the concealment effect. The concealment effect cannot be activated while any of the spirits are currently being used as _unseen servants_."
