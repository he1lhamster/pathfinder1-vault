Price: "–"
Weight: "4 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "19"
Aura: "strong enchantment"
Description: |
  "Each of the _Orbs of Dragonkin_ holds power over a specific race of lesser draconic creatures with the dragon type (except for true dragons). The bearer of an _Orb of Dragonkin_ can, as a standard action, dominate a creature of the orb's particular variety within 200 feet (as _dominate monster_), with the targeted creature being forced to make a DC 23 Will save to resist. Spell resistance is not useful against this effect. Each _Orb of Dragonkin_ grants the wielder the AC and saving throw bonuses of the draconic creature the orb is associated with. These values replace whatever values the character would otherwise have, whether better or worse. These values cannot be modified by any means short of ridding the character of the orb. The owner of an orb knows if there are draconic creatures of the type the orb is related to within 10 miles at all times. Each _Orb of Dragonkin_ also has an individual power that can be invoked once per round at caster level 10th."
Destruction: |
  "An _Orb of Dragonkin_ shatters if subjected to the breath weapon of a true dragon of the same alignment as the orb's associated draconic creature."
