Title: "Oil of Attraction"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "1700 gp"
Weight: "0.5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "3"
Aura: "faint necromancy"
Description: |
  "This vial of foul-smelling unguent is a great boon for trackers and hunters. Each vial of oil is keyed to a particular kind of creature and functions only against such creatures. The kind of creature is fairly narrow. The most common kinds are demons, devils, dragons, hags, lycanthropes, and vampires, but others might have corresponding _oils of attraction_ at the GM's discretion. Whenever a creature throws a vial at a target (treat this as a touch attack, like throwing a splash weapon without a splash radius), the vial shatters, coating the target on a direct hit. The foul slime drips off the coated creature, granting anyone trying to track it a +10 circumstance bonus on Survival checks.
  The scent of the oil grants anyone who can smell it a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against that creature, as well as a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against it. These bonuses stack with the favored enemy class feature.
  The oil lasts for 1 hour, during which no amount of washing with ordinary cleaning supplies can remove the slime from a creature. Only universal solvent denatures the oil. Bonuses from multiple _oils of attraction_ don't stack."
Crafting cost: "850 gp"

### Description

This _[[items/Mundane/Vial|vial]]_ of foul-smelling unguent is a great boon for trackers and hunters. Each _vial_ of oil is keyed to a particular kind of creature and functions only against such creatures. The kind of creature is fairly narrow. The most common kinds are demons, devils, dragons, hags, lycanthropes, and vampires, but others might have corresponding oils of attraction at the GM's discretion. Whenever a creature throws a _vial_ at a target (treat this as a touch attack, like _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Throwing|throwing]]_ a splash weapon without a splash radius), the _vial_ shatters, coating the target on a direct hit. The foul slime drips off the coated creature, granting anyone trying to track it a +10 circumstance bonus on Survival checks.

The _[[universal monster rules/Scent|scent]]_ of the oil grants anyone who can smell it a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against that creature, as well as a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against it. These bonuses stack with the favored enemy class feature.

The oil lasts for 1 hour, during which no amount of washing with ordinary cleaning supplies can remove the slime from a creature. Only _[[items/Wondrous Item/Universal Solvent|universal solvent]]_ denatures the oil. Bonuses from multiple oils of attraction don't stack.
