  "The surface of this stick of white chalk is covered with silvery runes. Drawing a line with the chalk creates a _wall of force_ that is as long as the line and extends 10 feet perpendicular to the surface on which the line was drawn. Drawing a 5-foot line is a standard action that provokes acts of opportunity. Each wall lasts 10 minutes; the bearer of the chalk can dismiss a section of wall as a swift action by touching the stick of chalk to it. One stick of _boundary chalk_ can draw 100 feet of line before it is used up, and it must be used in 5-foot increments."
