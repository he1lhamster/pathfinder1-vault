Description: |
  "This stone jar, capped with the head of an animal or human, resembles one of the traditional carved limestone or pottery canopic jars commonly used to hold the intestines, liver, lungs, and stomach of the deceased in Osirian mummification rites. Unlike normal canopic jars, a _canopic jar of unlife_ is used to preserve the existence of a powerful undead creature. When a corporeal undead creature is first created, one of its organs must be placed inside the _canopic jar of unlife_ as part of the ritual that transforms the creature into an undead being. Thereafter, the undead creature's existence is linked to the _canopic jar of unlife_.
  If the undead creature is destroyed, the _canopic jar of unlife_ disintegrates 2 hours later, and the viscera within the jar start to regenerate into a new undead body for the subject at a rate of 10 hit points per hour. The subject is helpless until restored to full hit points. Once used to regenerate an undead creature, a _canopic jar of unlife_ is destroyed. If the jar is opened manually after viscera are secured in it, the contents disintegrate with an ear-piercing scream and the jar loses all magical power. Smashing the jar (hardness 8, hp 20) also destroys the vessel and the viscera within.
  A _canopic jar of unlife_ only functions if linked to an undead creature during its creation; existing undead creatures or creatures with phylacteries (such as liches) or with the rejuvenation ability (such as mummy lords) cannot make use of a _canopic jar of unlife_."
