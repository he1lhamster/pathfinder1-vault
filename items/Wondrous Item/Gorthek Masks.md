Title: "Gorthek Masks"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "5800 gp"
Weight: "75 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "12"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "This set consists of two masks of hammered iron, one sized for a gorthek's face and the other sized for the face of its orc handler. To bond a gorthek with its handler, orcs permanently nail the _gorthek masks_ to the respective wearers' faces. The magic functions only when the _gorthek masks_ are affixed to one orc and one gorthek. It doesn't work with animals other than gortheks. There's only a 60% chance an orc's mask will function when affixed to a non-orc humanoid—and it's impossible to tell whether a mask will work until after it has been permanently attached.
  The orc's mask is fashioned with horns on the side, resembling those of a gorthek. With its bonded gorthek, the wearer gains the benefits of _speak with animals_ and a +10 competence bonus on Handle Animal checks.
  The gorthek's mask depicts fearsome tusks, scales, or other features meant to make the creature look more terrifying. A gorthek wearing its mask ignores the first 5 points of hardness of any object it hits with a gore attack when performing a sunder combat maneuver or when smashing an object. Any creature other than its handler takes a –10 penalty on Handle Animal checks against a bonded gorthek."
