Title: "Magic Talking Board"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "20000 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate divination"
Description: |
  "This rectangular wooden board displays an arch of alphabetical letters, numbers, and short affirmative and negative messages, and comes with a small, heart-shaped, three-legged pointer. Though it can be used in place of a mundane talking board (such as those used by spiritualists and seance-holders to speak to nearby haunts or their own subconscious minds), this item's magical properties don't rely on the presence of a haunt or a psychically sensitive individual to establish communications. When used for the automatic writing skill unlock in place of a mundane talking board, a _magic talking board_ provides a +5 circumstance bonus on the Linguistics check.
  Once per day, a _magic talking board_ can be used to call upon the spirit of a single deceased humanoid creature, as the spell _call spirit_. The spirit can attempt a DC 17 Will save to resist the summons; if it's successful, a spirit with malevolent intent always takes the place of the intended spirit. The spirit does not manifest as a vaporous apparition or speak; its communications instead come through the board itself. The spirit answers posed questions by guiding the pointer to specific letters at the rate of one word per round for as long as the user concentrates. Up to four creatures can use the board simultaneously, and the called spirit takes a penalty on its saving throw equal to the number of users beyond the first."
