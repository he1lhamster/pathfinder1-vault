Description: |
  "This black rock, usually worn on a heavy chain, looks pitted and partially charred and melted. It gives the impression of reckless evil—more a dangerous scent than any other kind of feeling. The wearer gains fire resistance 1 and a +1 resistance bonus on Will saves against fear. If the wearer takes 10 or more points of fire damage in a single round, a claw-shaped pattern glows faintly on the surface of the stone, similar to an _arcane mark_.
  If the dragon god Dahak is the wearer's patron, the wearer can use _shatter_ once per day. At will, the wearer can cause the claw-symbol on the rock to glow; true dragons immediately recognize the symbol as an icon of Dahak."
