Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Neck"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "faint enchantment"
Description: |
  "This magical slave collar (which uses the same statistics as masterwork manacles) is reserved for particularly strongwilled slaves. When shackled around a creature's neck, the collar targets the wearer with a _calm emotions_ effect (Will DC 13 negates). The wearer must attempt an additional save each minute it wears the collar until it fails a save or removes the collar. Once active, the calming effect of the collar remains until the collar is removed or the wearer takes a number of points of damage equal to or greater than its Hit Dice. Once per day, the wielder of the key to the _Saffron slave collar's_ lock (a superior lock) can cast _suggestion_ on the wearer. A successful DC 14 Will saving throw negates this effect, unless the target is subject to the _calm emotions_ effect of the collar, in which case it receives no saving throw."
