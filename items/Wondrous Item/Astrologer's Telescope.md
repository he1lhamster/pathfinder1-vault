Aura: "moderate divination"
Description: |
  "This telescope has over a dozen lenses and measurement devices attached to it. An _astrologer's telescope_ functions as a telescope with ×50 magnification (see page 27).
  A skilled astronomer can use an _astrologer's telescope_ to glean insights into the future by carefully manipulating the various lenses and other apparatuses attached to the telescope while gazing at the stars. When doing so, the user selects a Knowledge skill and attempts a DC 20 Knowledge (geography) check over the course of 1 hour while stargazing with the telescope. If she doesn't possess ranks in Knowledge (geography), she can attempt a Perception check instead, albeit at a –5 penalty.
  If the viewing is successful, the user records that check result. Anytime during the next 24 hours that the user would roll the selected Knowledge check, she can use the result of the earlier check as the result of her Knowledge check instead of rolling as normal. If the user is untrained in the selected Knowledge skill, she can use her Knowledge (geography) check result as the Knowledge check's result only if the DC is 20 or lower. If she doesn't use this benefit within 24 hours after the viewing, it is lost. The user can increase the amount of time she has to attempt the Knowledge check by adjusting the telescope's various apparatuses and taking a cumulative –5 penalty on her Knowledge (geography) or Perception check for every additional 24 hours she wishes to retain her insight.
  On a failed check to use the telescope, the user gains no useful insight into the future. Unskilled viewers can attempt only one Perception check per night; a viewer with ranks in Knowledge (geography) can attempt to use the telescope one additional time per night for every 2 ranks she has in Knowledge (geography). Each additional viewing attempt requires the user to spend 1 hour gazing through the telescope. A character can benefit from only one viewing at a time; a second viewing removes the previous benefit, regardless of whether the new attempt succeeds or fails."

### Description

This telescope has over a dozen lenses and measurement devices attached to it. An _[[items/Wondrous Item/Astrologer's Telescope|astrologer's telescope]]_ functions as a telescope with ×50 magnification (see page 27).

A skilled astronomer can use an _astrologer's telescope_ to glean insights into the future by carefully manipulating the various lenses and other apparatuses attached to the telescope while gazing at the stars. When doing so, the user selects a Knowledge skill and attempts a DC 20 Knowledge (geography) check over the course of 1 hour while stargazing with the telescope. If she doesn't possess ranks in Knowledge (geography), she can attempt a Perception check instead, albeit at a –5 penalty.

If the viewing is successful, the user records that check result. Anytime during the next 24 hours that the user would roll the selected Knowledge check, she can use the result of the earlier check as the result of her Knowledge check instead of rolling as normal. If the user is untrained in the selected Knowledge skill, she can use her Knowledge (geography) check result as the Knowledge check's result only if the DC is 20 or lower. If she doesn't use this benefit within 24 hours after the viewing, it is lost. The user can increase the amount of time she has to attempt the Knowledge check by adjusting the telescope's various apparatuses and taking a cumulative –5 penalty on her Knowledge (geography) or Perception check for every additional 24 hours she wishes to retain her insight.

On a failed check to use the telescope, the user gains no useful insight into the future. Unskilled viewers can attempt only one Perception check per night; a viewer with ranks in Knowledge (geography) can attempt to use the telescope one additional time per night for every 2 ranks she has in Knowledge (geography). Each additional viewing attempt requires the user to spend 1 hour gazing through the telescope.
