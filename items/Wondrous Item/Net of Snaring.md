Description: |
  "This _+1 distance net_ seems lighter than expected and is slightly sticky to the touch. Three times per day, the wielder may speak the command word and throw the _net of snaring_ at a target. This is a ranged touch attack with a range of 40 feet. The net immediately grows by two size categories. If the attack hits, the target must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save or become entangled. So long as the wielder retains control of the trailing rope, he may attempt or otherwise act on a grapple as a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Speaking the command word again shrinks the item to normal size so long as no creature is confined within it."
