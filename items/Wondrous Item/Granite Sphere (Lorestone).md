Title: "Granite Sphere (Lorestone)"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "90000 gp"
Weight: "15 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate divination"
Description: |
  "_Weathered carvings of constellations, suns, and planets cover the surface of this ancient, melon-sized stone sphere._
  This polished granite orb has more hidden layers than any other documented _lorestone_. Its cosmological layer emphasizes the moon over the sun and stars. Deeper layers present biologies of forest animals, maps of secret tunnels beneath the Verduran Forest, lore of lycanthropes and other shapechangers, and rituals designed to force a creature's inner beast to the surface. A harmonized possessor (DC 40) can use _moonstruck_ (DC 16) at will. The stone is currently held by Brackett, Venture-Captain of the Pathfinder Lodge in Almas, but the Pathfinder Society has not yet unlocked the stone's deepest knowledge.
  ### Lorestones
  _Lorestones_ are dense encyclopedias of natural lore carved in stone. The surface of a _lorestone_ is engraved with constellations and celestial markers, such as the orbits of planets. This astronomical information is only the first gateway to the knowledge encoded upon the sphere. Creatures who study the stone and succeed at a DC 20 Knowledge (nature) check identify inconsistencies and unusual prominences in the sky map, and realize that the sky map conceals information about weather patterns and seasonal changes, like a visual almanac. This climatic information also hides deeper truths; a reader who identifies this hidden information can attempt a DC 25 Knowledge (nature) check to identify omissions and emphases that indicate further concealed information. A _lorestone_ might have several successive layers of information, regarding such things as plant reproductive cycles, aquatic landscapes, and druidic rituals, but the Knowledge (nature) check necessary to unlock each subsequent layer increases by 5.
  A successful DC 30 or higher Knowledge (nature) check, as defined with each _lorestone_, allows a reader in possession of the stone to identify a unique path along the sphere. If the reader traces this path with a finger or other appendage, she harmonizes with the stone. After being harmonized with the user for 24 hours, that _lorestone_ grants her special benefits. These benefits are retained until a new creature harmonizes with the stone, which ends all previous harmonizations. Reharmonizing requires a reader to be in possession of the stone and again succeed at the required skill check, although the reader gains a +5 bonus on the checks because of her familiarity with the stone.
  ### History
  All documented _lorestones_ were crafted by the druids of the Verduran Forest. As the most recently crafted _lorestones_ are centuries old, it's unclear whether the druids currently active in the region have lost the skills needed to create _lorestones_ or have simply chosen to not do so.
  All _lorestones_ have constellation patterns concealing climatic information, but the stones' deeper layers of knowledge—and the magical effects unlocked through harmonization—differ based on the specific lorestone.
  ### Legacy
  _Lorestones_ provide a wealth of information, but only the truly knowledgeable can unlock the full potential of one of these ancient stones.
  **A Druidic Tradition:** Issian explorers venturing into Iobaria returned with tales that the druids of Fangard carried large round stones carved with constellation-like patterns. The explorers were not able to examine the spheres to ascertain whether these stones are _lorestones_ like those crafted by Verduran Forest druids, but some druidic connection seems likely."
