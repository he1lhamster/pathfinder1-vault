Description: |
  "This bright silver piccolo has an uncanny connection to the alien Dark Tapestry and produces only disjointed notes when played, no matter how talented the user. In fact, talented performers produce more dissonant notes. If the user succeeds at a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check while playing the _discordant piccolo_, one target creature within 30 feet is sickened for 1 round (Will DC 14 negates). If the user succeeds at a DC 25 Perform check, the target is instead nauseated for 1 round (Will DC 16 reduces the effect to sickened). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the _discordant piccolo_ for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect."
