  **Keeper of Stone (Ex/Su):** The _Tome of Stone Wards_ covers the geography of caves and mountains (especially the Five Kings Mountains) thoroughly, and gives eldritch insights into how such terrain is formed. This boon is not spent, but grants you a +1 insight bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering), Knowledge (geography), and Knowledge (nature) checks, as well as on Survival checks attempted in hills, mountains, and underground terrain. In addition, whenever you cast mending, make whole, or greater make whole on an object made entirely from stone, add 1d6 to the number of hit points restored to the object. These benefits last until you next regain spell slots or prepare spells."
