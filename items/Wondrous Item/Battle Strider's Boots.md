Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "2000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Feet"
Caster level: "3"
Aura: "faint illusion"
Description: |
  "While unattended, these rough leather boots appear to be in a slightly different place each time a creature observes them. They seem to flicker around the wearer's feet for the first 24 hours she wears them, reducing her movement speed by 5 feet and imposing a –2 penalty on Acrobatics checks.
  After she has worn the boots for 24 hours, the flickering decreases, the penalties end, and she can activate the boots. Three times per day, she can activate the boots as a swift action to avoid provoking attacks of opportunity while moving out of a threatened square. While activated, the boots conceal the wearer's movement in such a way that her foes see only short, blurred flashes of movement. Any creature that has blindsight or a similar nonvisual sense or is affected by _true seeing_ can still make attacks of opportunity against the wearer as normal."
