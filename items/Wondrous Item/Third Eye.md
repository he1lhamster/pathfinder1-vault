Description: |
  "As part of the process of crafting a _third eye_, the creator grafts an actual eye into the palm of the recipient's hand. Once an eye is grafted into a palm, it is undetectable while closed and doesn't hinder the user's manual dexterity in the slightest. When in use, the eye opens.
  The owner of a _third eye_ can use it to see through the donor creature's remaining eye. The _third eye_ can also be attuned to specially prepared bloodstones, allowing the user to observe things in each bloodstone's vicinity as if the bloodstone were an eye as well. Preparing a bloodstone in this manner requires soaking it in a potion of _clairvoyance/clairaudience_ for a week, at the end of which the owner drinks the potion and spits the bloodstone into the hand bearing the _third eye_. These bloodstones are often incorporated into magic items like phylacteries, rings, and amulets, allowing the user to gift such items to other creatures and thus gain a new viewpoint. This remote viewing ability functions at any range as long as the owner is on the same plane at the bloodstone. It also allows the owner to cast _clairaudience/clairvoyance_ up to three times per day.
  As long as the _third eye_ is open in a hand that isn't holding an object, the owner has all-round vision, gaining a +4 bonus on Perception checks and making it impossible to flank the owner. Rakshasas, whose fingers bend backwards, can use the powers of their _third eyes_ while holding objects since their _third eyes_ effectively look out of the "backs" of their hands.
  A _third eye_ cannot be transferred between creatures—if removed from the owner's body, a _third eye_ is destroyed. A _third eye_ that remains in the owner's palm but is damaged or otherwise permanently blinded becomes useless until a _remove blindness_ spell is cast upon it."
