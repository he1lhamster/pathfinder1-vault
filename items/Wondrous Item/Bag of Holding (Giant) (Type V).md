Description: |
  "This appears to be a rugged leather sack about 4 feet by 6 feet in size. It functions exactly the same as other types of _bags of holding_, but weighs more and has greater weight and volume limits, as shown on the table below.
  <table><tbody><tr><td>**Bag**</td><td>**Bag Weight**</td><td>**Contents Limit**</td><td>**Contents Volume Limit**</td><td>**Market Price**</td></tr><tr><td>Type V</td><td>100 lbs.</td><td>2,500 lbs.</td><td>450 cubic ft.</td><td>12,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Type VI</td><td>150 lbs.</td><td>4,000 lbs.</td><td>800 cubic ft.</td><td>15,000 gp</td></tr></tbody></table>
  Because of the larger volume of a giant-sized _bag of holding_, retrieving a specific item from it is always a full-round action.
  Type V and Type VI _bags of holding_ are most commonly found in use by giants and other Large creatures, but giants of Huge size or larger sometimes use even greater _bags of holding_."
