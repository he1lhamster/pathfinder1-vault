Description: |
  "This pungent, tar-black armor polish comes in a small, circular tin. The 1 dose contained in the tin is enough to apply to a single Medium suit of armor or two Small suits of armor. Applying the polish takes 10 minutes, during which time the user must visualize an alternative appearance for the armor to take on, such as a normal set of clothes or another set of armor. After the polish is applied, its noxious scent dissipates and the armor appears the way the user visualized, as the _glamered_ magic armor special ability. The armor maintains all properties other than its physical appearance, including weight, armor check penalty, and maximum Dexterity bonus. This effect remains for 24 hours before wearing off."
