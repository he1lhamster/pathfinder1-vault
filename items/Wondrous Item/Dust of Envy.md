Aura: "moderate abjuration"
Description: |
  "Upon a frail silver chain dangles a tiny crystalline phial filled with light blue dust. When one shatters the phial, it releases a potent flash of abjuration magic that affects all evocation and necromancy magic in a 30-foot-radius with a targeted _dispel magic_. Each phial holds one use of the dust and, once used, the item is destroyed. This phial can be used as a thrown weapon.
  While legends credit Runelord Belimarius with creating _dust of envy_, further historical accounts imply that the remaining runelords also uncovered the secrets of making their own virtue-related dusts — all of which activate under similar circumstances and produce similar effects, being attuned to a specific sin and targeting spells of the schools related to the two opposing sins."
