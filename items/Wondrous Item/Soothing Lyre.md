Title: "Soothing Lyre"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "45000 gp"
Weight: "3 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "13"
Aura: "strong conjuration, strong enchantment"
Description: |
  "This ornate string instrument looks as if it were crafted from gold and silver but is as light as hollow wood. It grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform (string instruments) checks. When the proper chords are struck (a standard action), the bearer can target all creatures within a 30-foot-radius burst with a _lullaby_ spell (DC 13) that lasts as long as the bearer concentrates plus up to 13 rounds.
  Additionally, once per day as a standard action, she can strum the lyre to affect up to nine creatures with _mass cure light wounds_, as per the spell. If the character has the bardic performance class feature, instead of this effect, she can perform a soothing performance once per day, even if she is not of sufficient level to normally have access to that ability (this still requires 4 rounds of continuous performance and still uses her bard level as the caster level). A bard who can use soothing performance and who plays the lyre as part of her performance increases her effective caster level for that ability by 1."
