Title: "Spy Eyes"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "15000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate divination"
Description: |
  "At first glance, _spy eyes_ appear to be cat's-eye marbles. When activated, each comes to life and blinks, transforming into an eyeball. When pressed against an inanimate surface (such as a wall or article of clothing), the eyeball absorbs into it, leaving a magical sensor of the same size on the surface. Anyone holding an eye from a particular cluster of _spy eyes_ can share the view from any other eye in the cluster as if that eye were her own, provided she is within 10 miles of that sensor. To recover a sensor, she can press a _spy eye_ she holds from the same cluster against the one that's in sensor form to make the sensor emerge and return to marble form.
  A single bag of _spy eyes_ contains five marbles (meaning that up to four may be deployed at any given time). _Spy eyes_ in sensor form can be detected via the normal means for detecting scrying."

When pressed against an inanimate surface (such as a wall or article of clothing), the eyeball absorbs into it, leaving a magical sensor of the same size on the surface.
