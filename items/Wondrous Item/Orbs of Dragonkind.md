Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "–"
Weight: "5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "20"
Aura: "strong enchantment"
Description: |
  "Each of these fabled _Orbs_ contains the essence and personality of an ancient dragon of a different variety (one for each of the major ten different chromatic and metallic dragons). The bearer of an _Orb_ can, as a standard action, dominate a dragon of its particular variety within 500 feet (as _dominate monster_), the dragon being forced to make a DC 25 Will save to resist. Spell resistance is not useful against this effect. Each _Orb of Dragonkind_ bestows upon the wielder the AC and saving throw bonuses of the dragon within. These values replace whatever values the character would otherwise have, whether they are better or worse. These values cannot be modified by any means short of ridding the character of the _Orb_. A character possessing an _Orb of Dragonkind_ is immune to the breath weapon—but only the breath weapon—of the dragon variety keyed to the _Orb_. Finally, a character possessing an _Orb_ can herself use the breath weapon of the dragon in the _Orb_ three times per day.
  All _Orbs of Dragonkind_ can be used to communicate verbally and visually with the possessors of the other _Orbs_. The owner of an _Orb_ knows if there are dragons within 10 miles at all times. For dragons of the _Orb's_ particular variety, the range is 100 miles. If within 1 mile of a dragon of the _Orb's_ variety, the wielder can determine the dragon's exact location and age. The bearer of one of these _Orbs_ earns the enmity of dragonkind forever for profiting by draconic enslavement, even if she later loses the item. Each _Orb_ also has an individual power that can be invoked once per round at caster level 10th."
Destruction: |
  "An _Orb of Dragonkind_ immediately shatters if it is caught in the breath weapon of a dragon who is a blood relative of the dragon trapped within. This causes everyone within 90 feet to be struck by the breath weapon of that dragon, released as the orb explodes."

Each of these fabled Orbs contains the essence and personality of an ancient dragon of a different variety (one for each of the major ten different chromatic and metallic dragons). The bearer of an Orb can, as a standard action, dominate a dragon of its particular variety within 500 feet (as _[[spells/Dominate Monster|dominate monster]]_), the dragon being forced to make a DC 25 Will save to resist. _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|Spell resistance]]_ is not useful against this effect. Each Orb of Dragonkind bestows upon the wielder the AC and saving throw bonuses of the dragon within. These values replace whatever values the character would otherwise have, whether they are better or worse. These values cannot be modified by any means short of ridding the character of the Orb. A character possessing an Orb of Dragonkind is immune to the _[[universal monster rules/Breath Weapon|breath weapon]]_—but only the _breath weapon_—of the dragon variety keyed to the Orb. Finally, a character possessing an Orb can herself use the _breath weapon_ of the dragon in the Orb three times per day.

If within 1 mile of a dragon of the Orb's variety, the wielder can determine the dragon's exact location and age. The bearer of one of these Orbs earns the enmity of dragonkind forever for profiting by draconic enslavement, even if she later loses the item. Each Orb also has an individual power that can be invoked once per round at caster level 10th.
