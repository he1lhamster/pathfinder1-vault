Title: "Orb of Golden Heaven"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "22000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "10"
Aura: "moderate evocation"
Description: |
  "This alabaster sphere, overlaid with golden bands set with diamonds in runelike patterns, sheds light like a _continual flame_ spell. Making a melee touch attack with the orb has the same effect as dousing the target with a flask of holy water. A good creature may hold the orb in hand and command it to invoke _consecrate_ and _searing light_ each once per day.
  The orb bestows one permanent negative level on any evil creature holding or carrying it. The negative level remains as long as the creature has the orb and disappears immediately when the orb is no longer held or carried. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by _restoration_ spells) while the bearer has the orb. If the bearer of an _orb of golden heaven_ wears a _crown of golden heaven_, its light counts as _daylight_ instead of _continual flame_, and its _consecrate_ acts as if the orb were a shrine to the bearer's deity."

### Description

This alabaster sphere, overlaid with golden bands set with diamonds in runelike patterns, sheds light like a _[[spells/Continual Flame|continual flame]]_ spell. Making a melee touch attack with the orb has the same effect as dousing the target with a _[[items/Mundane/Flask|flask]]_ of _[[items/Mundane/Holy water|holy water]]_. A good creature may hold the orb in hand and _[[spells/Command|command]]_ it to invoke _[[spells/Consecrate|consecrate]]_ and _[[spells/Searing Light|searing light]]_ each once per day.

The orb bestows one permanent negative level on any evil creature holding or carrying it. The negative level remains as long as the creature has the orb and disappears immediately when the orb is no longer held or carried. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by _[[spells/Restoration|restoration]]_ spells) while the bearer has the orb. If the bearer of an _[[items/Wondrous Item/Orb of Golden Heaven|orb of golden heaven]]_ wears a crown of golden heaven, its light counts as _[[spells/Daylight|daylight]]_ instead of _continual flame_, and its _consecrate_ acts as if the orb were a shrine to the bearer's deity.
