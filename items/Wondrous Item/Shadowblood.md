Description: |
  "_Shadowblood_ is among the most notorious of drugs—a fluid infused with a shadow demon's essence. Anyone who drinks this substance must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of cold damage and 1d4 points of Wisdom damage, and become nauseated for 1d6 rounds. Thereafter, the target gains 1d10+5 temporary hit points, cold resistance 5, and darkvision 60 feet. These effects persist for 1 hour, during which demons take a –4 penalty on saving throws against the drinker's spells and spell-like abilities of the shadow subschool.
  _Shadowblood_ is exceedingly addictive and carries some significant disadvantages. Each time a creature takes a dose of _shadowblood_, it must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or become addicted— _shadowblood_ addiction is a severe addiction (see page 236 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide). A creature under the influence of _shadowblood_ or suffering from _shadowblood_ addiction takes a –4 penalty on all saving throws against possession type effects made by demons, and can never gain the benefits of _protection from evil_ or similar spells against such effects."
