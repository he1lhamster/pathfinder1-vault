Description: |
  "These small grenades are made from hollowed eggshells filled with assorted powders and reagents and inscribed with magical glyphs. When broken, a _fugitive's grenade_ creates a 10-foot-radius cloud that lasts for 2 rounds. This cloud is otherwise identical to a _fog cloud_. A single smoke tendril in the center of the cloud forms a solid-feeling rope, 20 feet long, that functions as a _rope trick_ spell. When the smoke cloud dissipates, so does the smoke rope, though the _rope trick_ 's extradimensional space remains for its full duration. Once the smoke rope disperses, any creatures inside the extradimensional space must jump or climb out by other means. A _fugitive's grenade_ may be thrown as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet."
