Description: |
  "When rolled out from the bolt, the dimensions of this banner are 3 yards by 1-1/2 yards. It has the properties of a magic altar (_Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods_ 246) of Aroden. Praying at the altar grants a +2 competence bonus on all Knowledge checks, or one of the following weapon special abilities (worshiper's choice) to one magic weapon carried or wielded by the worshiper: _axiomatic_ or _bane_. This effect is suppressed if the weapon leaves the worshiper's grasp, but resumes if the weapon is returned to the worshiper. Additionally, if a day's worth of the water that drips from the dossal is collected, it acts as a vial of holy water. These abilities function only for characters who worship Aroden or Iomedae, and last for 24 hours. They are granted as a function of the magic of the altar itself, not the power of the dead god.
  As a result of Iomedae's blessing, when the dossal is used as an altar, it also allows any cleric of Iomedae who prepares his spells in its presence to prepare domain spells from one of the following domains: Community, Knowledge, Law, or Protection. These are the four domains once granted by Aroden that are not also granted by Iomedae. The cleric doesn't gain any of the other abilities of the domain.
  While most altars lose their abilities if moved, the dossal regains its power as an altar once it has been securely hung for 24 hours. The dossal has hardness 30, 100 hp, and the ability to regain 5 hit points each round."
