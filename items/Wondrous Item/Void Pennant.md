  "This long tapering pennant resembles a stylized serpentine figure wearing a shimmering crown. The figure's claws function as clasps, attaching it to a lance, polearm, frame, or staff. The pennant has no effect when not mounted properly, or when activated by a lawfully aligned creature.
  Planting the pennant in the ground generates an area of twisted space around the flag out to a range of 30 feet. Any creature that teleports into or out of this area is nauseated for 1 round (a DC 18 Fortitude save reduces this penalty to sickened). Any creature may end the effect by uprooting the pennant as a standard action. The pennant functions for 10 rounds per day. These rounds do not need to be consecutive."
