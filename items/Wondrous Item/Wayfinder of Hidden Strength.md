  "This _wayfinder_ is made of heat-treated bronze that seems to warp and shimmer in the light. It contains a single slot to store an _ioun stone_ (_Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment_ 305), and the _wayfinder's_ construction allows the bearer to overtax the ioun stone's magical properties once per day to create a special, short-term resonance effect based on the stone's shape. This process suppresses any other resonance effects the _ioun stone_ might grant for 24 hours. The _ioun stone_ is especially fragile during this time, crumbling to pieces if removed from the wayfinder"
