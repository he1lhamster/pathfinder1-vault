### Description

These special containers are typically inlaid with runes of silver and stoppered by a brass plug bearing a seal engraved with sigils, glyphs, and special symbols. When the user speaks the _[[spells/Command|command]]_ word, he can force any creature from another plane into the container, provided that creature fails a DC 19 Will save. The range of this effect is 60 feet. Only one creature at a time can be so contained. Loosing the stopper frees the captured creature.

The _command_ word can be used only once per day.

If the individual freeing the captured creature speaks the _command_ word, the creature can be forced to serve for 1 hour. If freed without the _command_ word, the creature acts according to its natural inclinations. (It usually attacks the user, unless it perceives a good reason not to.) Any attempt to force the same creature into the _[[items/Mundane/Flask|flask]]_ a second time provides it a +2 bonus on its saving throw and makes it hostile. A purchased _[[items/Mundane/Bottle|bottle]]_ is empty, but a newly discovered _bottle_ might contain any of the following:
