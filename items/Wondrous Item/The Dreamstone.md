Description: |
  "The _dreamstone_ 's primary function is to surround itself with a stable dreamscape within the Dimension of Dreams. The _dreamstone_ 's radius is fluid and ever-expanding when the artifact is awakened, overlaying both the Material and Ethereal Planes, though it is held in check by any significant bodies of water, such as rivers or seas. The nature of the dream realm changes within this radius, creating a communally shared dreamscape that distortedly reflects the features of the Material Plane. Its power shifts the Dimension of Dreams' properties to alterable morphic and normal magic planar traits.
  Dreamers who fall asleep within planes affected by the _dreamstone_ 's influence do not create their own ephemeral demiplanes, but rather appear randomly within the _dreamstone_ 's stabilized dreamscape. Those who experience deadly nightmares are affected differently in the _dreamstone_ 's realm. Normal dreamers killed in the dreamscape wake up exhausted, while lucid dreamers whose lucid bodies perish also die in the waking world. Lucid dreamers can still make attempts to alter the dreamscape's reality with Charisma checks, just as in their own personal dreamscapes, but the DC increases by 5. Spell slots and magic item charges used by lucid dreamers in the _dreamstone_ 's dreamscape are also consumed in the real world. A person falling asleep in the dreamstone's radius has a 10% chance of experiencing a lucid dream.
  The dreamscape holds other dangers. Regardless of the lucidity of their dreaming body, each dreamer must make a successful saving throw each night or be set upon by the realm's dark presences, affecting the dreamer as a _nightmare_ spell. This effect initially requires a DC 15 Will save, but dreamers begin with a +10 Will save modifier due to the _dreamstone_ 's lack of familiarity with them as a target. On each subsequent visit, the _dreamstone_ becomes more aware of its demiplane's visitors, and its familiarity with dreamers grows after every 15 visits, increasing the DC by 5 (removing the +10 Will save modifier after the first increase).
  When a creature dies within the stabilized dreamscape, whether due to the perils of lucid dreaming or the _dreamstone_ 's _nightmare_ effect, the _dreamstone_ 's radius spreads 1 foot for each of that creature's Hit Dice. Close proximity to the _dreamstone_ is also hazardous, and the stone radiates a _vision of Hell_ effect (Will DC 20 negates) out to 50 feet that reflects the terror and destruction it was destined to inflict as it fell to Golarion. Ancient tomes such as the _Paginarum Lethargica_ theorize that once the _dreamstone_ 's boundaries reach a certain threshold, it can overcome bodies of water, and all within will be consumed in a fiery cataclysm, fulfilling the predictions of its visions. Neither the dreaming nor the waking world will be spared."
Destruction: |
  "Should a breach the veil of dreams occult ritual be performed in the immediate proximity of the _dreamstone_ on the Material Plane, the meteorite falls into an inactive slumber, or reawakens if it is already asleep. If the ritual is performed with the _dreamstone_ within i ts own dreamscape, the stone placed within the ritual's open threshold, and the portal then shut, the _dreamstone_ is forever destroyed."

### Description

_[[items/Wondrous Item/The Dreamstone|The dreamstone]]_ 's primary function is to surround itself with a _[[conditions/Stable|stable]]_ dreamscape within the Dimension of Dreams. _The dreamstone_ 's radius is fluid and ever-expanding when the artifact is awakened, overlaying both the Material and Ethereal Planes, though it is held in check by any significant bodies of water, such as rivers or seas. The nature of the _[[spells/Dream|dream]]_ realm changes within this radius, creating a communally shared dreamscape that distortedly reflects the features of the Material Plane. Its power shifts the Dimension of Dreams' properties to alterable morphic and normal magic _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Planar|planar]]_ traits.

Dreamers who fall asleep within planes affected by _the dreamstone_ 's influence do not create their own ephemeral demiplanes, but rather appear randomly within _the dreamstone_ 's stabilized dreamscape. Those who experience _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ nightmares are affected differently in _the dreamstone_ 's realm. Normal dreamers killed in the dreamscape wake up _[[conditions/Exhausted|exhausted]]_, while lucid dreamers whose lucid bodies perish also die in the waking world. Lucid dreamers can still make attempts to alter the dreamscape's reality with Charisma checks, just as in their own personal dreamscapes, but the DC increases by 5. Spell slots and magic item charges used by lucid dreamers in _the dreamstone_ 's dreamscape are also consumed in the real world. A person falling asleep in _the dreamstone_'s radius has a 10% chance of experiencing a lucid _dream_.

The dreamscape holds other dangers. Regardless of the lucidity of their dreaming body, each dreamer must make a successful saving throw each night or be set upon by the realm's dark presences, affecting the dreamer as a _[[spells/Nightmare|nightmare]]_ spell. This effect initially requires a DC 15 Will save, but dreamers begin with a +10 Will save modifier due to _the dreamstone_ 's lack of familiarity with them as a target. On each subsequent visit, _the dreamstone_ becomes more aware of its demiplane's visitors, and its familiarity with dreamers grows after every 15 visits, increasing the DC by 5 (removing the +10 Will save modifier after the first increase).

When a creature dies within the stabilized dreamscape, whether due to the perils of lucid dreaming or _the dreamstone_ 's _nightmare_ effect, _the dreamstone_ 's radius spreads 1 foot for each of that creature's Hit Dice. Close proximity to _the dreamstone_ is also hazardous, and the stone radiates a _[[spells/Vision of Hell|vision of Hell]]_ effect (Will DC 20 negates) out to 50 feet that reflects the terror and _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ it was destined to inflict as it fell to Golarion. Ancient tomes such as the Paginarum Lethargica theorize that once _the dreamstone_ 's boundaries reach a certain threshold, it can overcome bodies of water, and all within will be consumed in a fiery cataclysm, fulfilling the predictions of its visions. Neither the dreaming nor the waking world will be spared.

### _Destruction_

Should a breach the _[[spells/Veil|veil]]_ of dreams occult ritual be performed in the immediate proximity of _the dreamstone_ on the Material Plane, the meteorite falls into an inactive slumber, or reawakens if it is already asleep. If the ritual is performed with _the dreamstone_ within i ts own dreamscape, the stone placed within the ritual's open threshold, and the portal then shut, _the dreamstone_ is forever destroyed.
