Description: |
  "An intricately detailed miniature sailing ship sits inside this clear glass bottle. When taken aboard an undamaged sailing vessel at sea, the model automatically reconfigures to become a perfect replica of the new ship. It takes 24 hours for the model to attune to the ship.
  A ship attuned to an _impossible bottle_ takes half damage from all attacks that deal damage. The model ship in the _impossible bottle_ absorbs the remaining damage, registering holes in its hull, rips in its sails, and scorch marks from fire. Once the attuned ship gains the broken condition, however, the _impossible bottle_ ceases its protection, and any further attacks on the attuned ship deal full damage. If the attuned ship gains the sinking condition or is destroyed, the _impossible bottle_ shatters and is permanently destroyed. If an _impossible bottle_ was attuned to a damaged ship, once that ship has been fully repaired, the _impossible bottle_ re-attunes itself over 24 hours and thereafter resumes its protection. An _impossible bottle_ removed from its attuned ship ceases its protection, and must be re-attuned over 24 hours if brought back on board. If the bottle is shattered while it is attuned to a ship, the _impossible bottle_ is destroyed and the attuned ship immediately takes 150 points of damage.
  Lastly, an _impossible bottle_ can be used to repair an unattuned ship. As long as the bottle still functions, its owner can christen a vessel by smashing the _impossible bottle_ against the ship's prow, releasing a wave of restorative magic that immediately repairs up to 150 points of damage to the vessel."

### Description

An intricately detailed miniature sailing ship sits inside this clear glass _[[items/Mundane/Bottle|bottle]]_. When taken aboard an undamaged sailing vessel at sea, the model automatically reconfigures to become a perfect replica of the new ship. It takes 24 hours for the model to attune to the ship.

A ship attuned to an _[[items/Wondrous Item/Impossible Bottle|impossible bottle]]_ takes half damage from all attacks that deal damage. The model ship in the _impossible bottle_ absorbs the remaining damage, registering holes in its hull, rips in its sails, and scorch marks from fire. Once the attuned ship gains the _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ condition, however, the _impossible bottle_ ceases its protection, and any further attacks on the attuned ship deal full damage. If the attuned ship gains the sinking condition or is destroyed, the _impossible bottle_ shatters and is permanently destroyed. If an _impossible bottle_ was attuned to a damaged ship, once that ship has been fully repaired, the _impossible bottle_ re-attunes itself over 24 hours and thereafter resumes its protection. An _impossible bottle_ removed from its attuned ship ceases its protection, and must be re-attuned over 24 hours if brought back on board. If the _bottle_ is shattered while it is attuned to a ship, the _impossible bottle_ is destroyed and the attuned ship immediately takes 150 points of damage.

Lastly, an _impossible bottle_ can be used to repair an unattuned ship. As long as the _bottle_ still functions, its owner can christen a vessel by _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Smashing|smashing]]_ the _impossible bottle_ against the ship's prow, releasing a wave of restorative magic that immediately repairs up to 150 points of damage to the vessel.
