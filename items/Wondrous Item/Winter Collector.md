Aura: "strong conjuration, strong evocation"
Description: |
  "_Winter collectors_ are always located in areas of severe cold, and are typically surrounded by thick snow or ice. A _winter collector_ siphons a portion of the ambient cold weather and condenses it into concentrated cold energy, which the collector then beams like a signal across worlds to the _winter receiver_ in the Royal Palace in Whitethrone. This energy then radiates out to the borders of Irrisen, keeping the weather in a perpetual wintry state. In addition, a _winter collector_ functions as a permanent _gate_, allowing instant travel from the collector's location to the Royal Palace (but not in the other direction), even if the collector is located on the Material Plane.
  A _winter collector_ radiates an aura of cold out to 50 feet. This aura deals 6d6 points of cold damage each round to creatures in this area. Creatures within 10 feet of the _winter collector_ take 12d6 points of cold damage each round. Half of this cold damage is not subject to being reduced by resistance or immunity to cold-based effects."
Destruction: |
  "Each _winter collector_ has a unique means of destruction, which is left for the GM to develop, though successfully destroying a _winter collector_ should be a trial worthy of gaining a mythic tier."

### Description

Winter collectors are always located in areas of severe cold, and are typically surrounded by thick snow or ice. A _[[items/Wondrous Item/Winter Collector|winter collector]]_ siphons a portion of the ambient cold weather and condenses it into concentrated cold energy, which the collector then beams like a signal across worlds to the winter receiver in the Royal Palace in Whitethrone. This energy then radiates out to the borders of Irrisen, keeping the weather in a perpetual wintry state. In addition, a _winter collector_ functions as a permanent _[[spells/Gate|gate]]_, allowing instant travel from the collector's location to the Royal Palace (but not in the other direction), even if the collector is located on the Material Plane.

A _winter collector_ radiates an aura of cold out to 50 feet. This aura deals 6d6 points of cold damage each round to creatures in this area. Creatures within 10 feet of the _winter collector_ take 12d6 points of cold damage each round. Half of this cold damage is not subject to being reduced by _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ or _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to cold-based effects.
