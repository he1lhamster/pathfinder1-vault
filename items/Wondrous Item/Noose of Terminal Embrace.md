Title: "Noose of Terminal Embrace"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "20000 gp"
Weight: "5 lbs."
Slot: "Neck"
Caster level: "15"
Aura: "strong conjuration, strong transmutation"
Description: |
  "When the necromancer Osmyrd Glavis was lynched in southern Taldor, his final utterance of hatred infused the very rope that was cutting into his flesh, resulting in the first _noose of terminal embrace_. Since then, many others have duplicated the magic item, yet the original remains lost—though some say it still hangs about the neck of its undead master.
  When a _noose of terminal embrace_ is placed around the neck, it immediately activates, tightening and dealing 2d4 points of damage at that moment. Removing the noose thereafter requires a full-round action and a successful DC 18 Strength check (with failure resulting in an additional 2d4 points of damage).
  While the noose is worn, its frayed end dangles a foot or so from the neck, but once per day if the wearer of the noose is successfully grappled by a Large or smaller creature, the wearer may will the noose's length to extend and lash out at the attacker. This allows the wearer to immediately attempt a grapple check against the attacker; if successful, he establishes the grapple on the attacker rather than the other way around, and the attacker's attempt automatically fails (although the attacker may attempt to grapple the wearer in the future)."

### Description

When the necromancer Osmyrd Glavis was lynched in southern Taldor, his final utterance of hatred infused the very rope that was cutting into his flesh, resulting in the first _[[items/Wondrous Item/Noose of Terminal Embrace|noose of terminal embrace]]_. Since then, many others have duplicated the magic item, yet the original remains lost—though some say it still hangs about the neck of its _[[feats/Undead Master|undead master]]_.

When a _noose of terminal embrace_ is placed around the neck, it immediately activates, tightening and dealing 2d4 points of damage at that moment. Removing the noose thereafter requires a full-round action and a successful DC 18 Strength check (with failure resulting in an additional 2d4 points of damage).

While the noose is worn, its frayed end dangles a foot or so from the neck, but once per day if the wearer of the noose is successfully _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ by a Large or smaller creature, the wearer may will the noose's length to extend and lash out at the attacker. This allows the wearer to immediately attempt a grapple check against the attacker; if successful, he establishes the grapple on the attacker rather than the other way around, and the attacker's attempt automatically fails (although the attacker may attempt to grapple the wearer in the future).
