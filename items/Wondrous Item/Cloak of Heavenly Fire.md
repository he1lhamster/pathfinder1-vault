  "This white silk cloak shimmers with divine energy. Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer of a _cloak of heavenly fire_ can cause it to flash with flames as another creature touches the wearer or strikes the wearer with a melee attack. These flames deal 1d8+5 points of fire damage to the creature that touched the wearer. If the creature subjected to this damage is evil, it takes an additional 1d8+5 points of damage as the fire glows with golden light—this additional damage is divine in nature and not subject to energy resistance or immunity.

Once per day as a standard action, the wearer of a _cloak of heavenly fire_ can also use the magic to cure wounds, restoring 2d8+5 hit points to a touched creature."
