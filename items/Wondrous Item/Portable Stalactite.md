Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "3"
Aura: "faint transmutation"
Description: |
  "This miniature stone stalactite measures 4 to 5 inches long. As a standard action, you can toss a _portable stalactite_ up to any solid surface no more than 20 feet above, whereupon the _portable stalactite_ automatically affixes to the ceiling. If no suitable ceiling exists, the _portable stalactite_ falls at your feet.
  Once affixed, the _portable stalactite_ remains in place until you call it back to your hand (a standard action) or until a living creature (except you) walks under it, at which point it drops from the ceiling and makes a +10 attack roll aainst the target. If it hits, it deals 1d6+1 points of damage.
  You can affix as many _portable stalactites_ as you like to an area's ceiling, but you must leave at least 5 feet of space between each. A _portable stalactite_ can be detected and disarmed as if it were a trap—it's a DC 20 Search check to discover, and a DC 15 Disarm Device check to safely detach one."
