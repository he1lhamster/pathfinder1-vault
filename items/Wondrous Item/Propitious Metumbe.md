Description: |
  "This polished talisman of darkwood inscribed with the pictogram of a specific wendo hangs from a loop of twine. The wearer gains a +2 luck bonus on saving throws against witch hexes, spells and abilities with the curse descriptor, and any spells or effects that would force the wielder to reroll a die or roll multiple dice and take the worst result.
  Once per day when the wearer is targeted by such a spell or effect that doesn't normally grant a saving throw, she can make a Will saving throw to negate the effect. If she attempts the save against a spell, the save DC is equal to 10 + the spell's level + the caster's primary casting ability bonus (Cha for sorcerers, Int for wizards, Wis for clerics, and so forth). If she attempts the save against a non-spell effect, the save DC is equal to 10 + half the HD of the effect's source + the source's Charisma modifier."
