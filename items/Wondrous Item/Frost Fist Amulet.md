  "Shaped like a fist, this iron amulet is surrounded by a frigid fog. On command, this amulet causes the wearer's hands to become encased in a layer of freezing iron. The wearer is protected from the frigid cold and can make savage blows with his hands. Unarmed strikes and natural attacks the wearer makes with hands gain the _frost_ weapon special ability and are treated as cold iron for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction.
