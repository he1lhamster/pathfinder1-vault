Price: "–"
Weight: "2000 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "18"
Aura: "strong conjuration"
Description: |
  "This beautifully carved stone fountain is decorated with figures of dancing fey creatures and holds pure, shimmering water that glows with silvery light. The moon-goddess Acavna gave the _Argental Font_ to the city of Saventh-Yhi at its founding as a gift in gratitude for the heroine Savith's valor. Anyone drinking from the fountain enjoys the combined benefits of _greater restoration_ and _heal_, and is immediately cured of all afflictions, including ability damage or drain, negative levels, and insanities. The waters cannot return the dead to life, though an undead creature immersed in the fountain is immediately destroyed (no save). The fountain never runs dry, no matter how many times it is used or how much water is taken from it, but the water retains its potency for only 1 round after being removed from the fountain, becoming normal water thereafter. The font can only be moved from its location with a _miracle_ or _wish_ spell. An individual creature can only benefit from the effects of the _Argental Font_ once per year."
Destruction: |
  "If a good celestial creature of at least 10 Hit Dice ever willingly commits suicide while in the font's waters, the fountain ceases to flow and its waters lose all special properties."
