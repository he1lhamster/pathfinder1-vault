Title: "Thremyr's Beard (Greater)"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "42250 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Head"
Caster level: "13"
Aura: "strong evocation"
Description: |
  "This mithral helm has a faceplate resembling a frost giant's face, complete with a beard formed from layered, thin metal rods. While wearing a _Thremyr's beard_, a creature gains a +5 competence bonus on Intimidate checks and a +2 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate a frost giant or svathurim (though the helm does nothing to increase the wearer's size).
  Once per day as an immediate action after being successfully hit by a melee weapon, the wearer of a _lesser Thremyr's beard_ can order the helm to animate, whereupon the thin metal rods of the helm's beard reach out to grasp the weapon. This functions as a disarm combat maneuver that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
  A _lesser Thremyr's beard_ has a CMB of +23; the wearer can use the helm's CMB or her own CMB, whichever is higher.
  A _greater Thremyr's beard_ functions identically to the lesser version, but offers more protection for the wearer's vulnerable neck. Once per day as an immediate action after a critical hit is confirmed against the wearer with a melee weapon, the wearer can force the attacker to reroll the confirmation roll and take the worse result."

### Description

This mithral helm has a faceplate resembling a frost giant's face, complete with a beard formed from layered, thin metal rods. While wearing a Thremyr's beard, a creature gains a +5 competence bonus on Intimidate checks and a +2 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate a frost giant or _[[monsters/Svathurim|svathurim]]_ (though the helm does nothing to increase the wearer's size).

Once per day as an immediate action after being successfully hit by a melee weapon, the wearer of a lesser Thremyr's beard can order the helm to animate, whereupon the thin metal rods of the helm's beard reach out to _[[spells/Grasp|grasp]]_ the weapon.
