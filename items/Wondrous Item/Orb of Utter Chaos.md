Price: "36000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "10"
Aura: "moderate abjuration"
Description: |
  "This globe of varicolored material constantly shifts hue and texture, from steel-hard to spongy or even gelatinous. The bearer of the orb is constantly protected by _entropic shield_. Three times per day, when the bearer holds the orb and casts a spell with the polymorph subtype, chaotic descriptor, or one that gives creatures the confused condition, she may modify her caster level for that spell by 1d6–2.
  Once per day the bearer may hold the orb and command it to _dispel magic_. If the dispel check succeeds, the wielder absorbs the unraveled magical energy through the orb and gains the benefit of an _aid_ spell.
  The orb bestows one permanent negative level on any lawful creature holding or carrying it. The negative level remains as long as the creature has the orb and disappears immediately when the orb is no longer held or carried. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by _restoration_ spells) while the bearer has the orb."
