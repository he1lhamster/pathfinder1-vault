Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "5000 gp"
Weight: "3 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "faint conjuration"
Description: |
  "A luxurious crimson silk hammock embroidered with gold thread and gold fringed tassels, a _hospitality's hammock_ is a beauty to behold, but no self-respecting seaman would ever be caught using it. Aside from the hammock's considerable looks, a single night's rest in it eliminates any sign of seasickness (see page 26). Additionally, a _hospitality's hammock_ is so comfortable that those who sleep in it for a full 8 hours regain hit points as if they had an entire day of bed rest. Climbing into or out of the hammock is a fullround action. A successful DC 5 Dexterity check reduces this to a move action.
  The captain of the _Man's Promise_ was particularly susceptible to seasickness, and commissioned this item to make his long voyages away from home more comfortable. Although he would never admit it to those under his command, Mr. Plugg was pleasantly surprised to find the _hospitality's hammock_ in his cabin when he took command of the _Man's Promise_, and has slept in it every night since.
  The _hospitality's hammock_ originally appeared on page 72 of Necromancer Games' _Dead Man's Chest_."
