Description: |
  "This delicate circlet appears to be made of living blue-green vines with tiny leaves.

In the springtime the crown sprouts crystalline flowers which eventually fall off but retain their beauty (the elven monarch has a tradition of giving these flowers to favored citizens).
  The oldest legends of Kyonin's elves seem to indicate that there was a time when their ruler did not wear the _Viridian Crown_, but only a handful of fragmentary tales survive from that prehistory. In elven memory it has always been part of the crown jewels. The crown is a living thing that grows according to its wearer's will. In centuries where war is the norm the crown tends to grow thorns in a helm-like configuration, while in times of peace it prunes itself to become delicate and artistic.
  At will you may use _detect poison_, _heal_, _light_, or _break enchantment_ as a standard action. Once per day you may use _heroes' feast_ and _resurrection_.
  If you are the properly anointed ruler of the Kyonin elves, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and Charisma. You may use _scrying_ at will on any of your subjects (any elf who acknowledges your authority as the elven monarch). You and any subjects within 60 feet gain the benefits of a _good hope_ spell at all times. Three times per day while within Kyonin you may create a _guards and wards_ effect."
