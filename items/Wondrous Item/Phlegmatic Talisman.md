Description: |
  "This turbid blue, teardrop-shaped devil talisman binds a particular devil to a specific location, trapping the fiend in a manner similar to _planar binding_ but without the need for a _magic circle_ and with no chance of the devil escaping. Once bound, the devil cannot move farther than 100 feet from the location it is bound to, and the devil is considered helpful toward the talisman's wearer for the purposes of any request related to the location it is bound to (thus negating the need for an opposed Charisma check to convince the bound devil to perform such a service). A creature must be wearing the _phlegmatic talisman_ to make requests of the bound devil.
  When within 100 feet of each other, the wearer of the _phlegmatic talisman_ and the devil bound to it cannot attack or take offensive actions against one another, even if magically influenced (such as by _charm monster_ or _dominate monster_). In addition, when within 100 feet of each other, the wearer and the bound devil each gain a +4 profane bonus on Will saves against spells and effects that possess or exercise mental control over a creature (including effects with the charm or compulsion descriptors).
  A _phlegmatic talisman_ is crafted to bind a specific devil, and is not capable of binding any other creature. Any mortal who meets the construction requirements can craft a _phlegmatic talisman_ as long as she knows the true name of the devil to be bound to the talisman, which must be spoken during the item's creation. In order to finally bind the devil to the talisman, the wearer of the talisman must touch the talisman to the devil in the location the devil will be bound to (so the wearer and the devil must both be physically present in the binding location) and speak the devil's true name. If the devil bound to a _phlegmatic talisman_ is destroyed on the same plane as the talisman, the talisman breaks and loses its magic. Conversely, if the _phlegmatic talisman_ binding the devil is destroyed, the devil is freed.
  Archbaron Fex's _phlegmatic talisman_ is tied to the heresy devil Visperthul (see page 53) and was crafted to bind Visperthul to the Inferno Gate (see area **Q16**)."
