Caster level: "4"
Aura: "faint divination"
Description: |
  "This thin, silver circlet allows an animal wearing it to speak, even if it is not normally capable of doing so because of its low Intelligence score or lack of known languages. The creator of the item decides what language the circlet's wearer can speak when she crafts the item (typically Common); once crafting is complete, this cannot be changed. A _circlet of speaking_ does not grant an animal a bonus to Intelligence, and the wearer's general behavior remains largely the same while it wears a _circlet of speaking_, though it can communicate its desires and rudimentary knowledge as though being spoken to via _speak with animals_."
