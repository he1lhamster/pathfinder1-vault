  "This aged and worn scabbard is believed to have once held one of a dozen legendary scimitar relics named _Dawnflower's Kiss_. From its prolonged proximity to such a divine blade, the scabbard has acquired its own unique magical abilities. Twice per day on command, the wearer can draw forth a blazing beam of red-hot fire from the scabbard that can be wielded as if it were a scimitar, as per _flame blade_.
  If Sarenrae is the wearer's patron, half of the _flame blade's_ damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire."
