Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "750 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "faint transmutation"
Description: |
  "This ornate glass bottle is filled with loose sand. A _bottle of shifting sand_ can be thrown as a splash weapon targeting a specific grid intersection (_Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook_ 202). Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. If thrown on an earthen or sandy surface, the bottle breaks, creating an area of churning, shifting sand in a 20-foot spread that obliterates tracks and is considered difficult terrain. Acrobatics checks in the area take a –5 penalty. Creatures entering or beginning their turn in the affected area must succeed at a DC 14 Reflex save each round or become entangled until the beginning of their next turn. If they attempt to move while entangled, they must succeed at a second Reflex save or fall prone. At the end of 5 rounds, the sand disappears, leaving no aftereffects.
  If a _bottle of shifting sand_ is thrown at a creature, a direct hit instead throws up a cloud of whirling sand that surrounds the creature. This cloud of sand provides concealment to the target and any creatures in adjacent squares for 1 round, but has no effect on the surrounding terrain."
