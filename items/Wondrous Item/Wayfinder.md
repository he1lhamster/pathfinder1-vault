Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "500 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "5"
Aura: "faint evocation"
Description: |
  "A small magical device patterned on the design of ancient Azlanti relics, a _wayfinder_ is a compact compass typically made from silver and bearing gold accents. While it serves as a badge of office for agents of the Pathfinder Society, a _wayfinder_ is as much a handy tool as a status symbol. With a command word, you can cause a _wayfinder_ to shine (as the _light_ spell). A _wayfinder_ also acts as a nonmagical (magnetic) compass, granting you a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost. All wayfinders feature a small indentation designed to hold a single _ioun stone_. An _ioun stone_ slotted in this manner grants you its normal benefits as if it were orbiting your head; some _ioun stones_ can grant additional powers once they are fitted into a _wayfinder_, at the GM's discretion."
