Title: "Nail of Blood"
Type: "Wondrous Item"
Price: "25000 gp"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate necromancy"
Description: |
  "Inscribed along its length with wicked-looking runes, this 3-inch-long nail is made of black metal and gives off a faint, eerie blue glow. Powered by strange necromantic magic, the nail allows a spellcaster to cast spells within a magic dead zone by drawing on the caster's life force to power her magic. To be effective, the nail must be placed alongside the flesh in an empty magic item slot (excluding eyes, head, and headband). In a process that takes 1 round, the nail melts painlessly into the wielder's flesh before taking effect (removing the nail is also painless and takes 1 round). Once the nail is in place, its wielder can cast within a magic dead zone up to one spell of each spell level she knows or has prepared and could normally cast. If she wishes to cast additional spells in the magic dead zone, she can do so up to her normal limit, but each additional spell she thus casts causes her to become fatigued and requires a successful concentration check (DC = 15 + the spell's level) or the spell fizzles. If the _nail of blood_ would cause the wielder to be fatigued when she already has the fatigued condition, she becomes exhausted. She can't use the _nail of blood_ to cast additional spells while she is exhausted, no matter what effect caused her exhausted condition."

Powered by strange necromantic magic, the nail allows a spellcaster to cast spells within a magic dead zone by drawing on the caster's life force to power her magic. To be effective, the nail must be placed alongside the flesh in an empty magic item slot (excluding eyes, head, and headband).

If she wishes to cast additional spells in the magic dead zone, she can do so up to her normal limit, but each additional spell she thus casts causes her to become _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_ and requires a successful concentration check (DC = 15 + the spell's level) or the spell fizzles. If the _[[items/Wondrous Item/Nail of Blood|nail of blood]]_ would cause the wielder to be _fatigued_ when she already has the _fatigued_ condition, she becomes _[[conditions/Exhausted|exhausted]]_. She can't use the _nail of blood_ to cast additional spells while she is _exhausted_, no matter what effect caused her _exhausted_ condition.
