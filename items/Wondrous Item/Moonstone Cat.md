If the user expends 20 uses, the helpless creature can't be awoken for an entire century.
  While in this sleep, the helpless creature's heart rate and breathing slow to a barely perceptible rate. It doesn't need to eat or drink, though it must still breathe and it ages normally while in this magical sleep. A _wish_, _miracle_, or _mythic break enchantment_ can end this magical sleep."
