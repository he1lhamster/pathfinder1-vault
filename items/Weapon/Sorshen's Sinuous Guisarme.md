Description: |
  "_Sorshen's Sinuous Guisarme_ is a _+5 keen speed spell-storing mithral guisarme_. Although it has a blade at each end, it is not technically a double weapon—when its _speed_ special ability is used to make an extra attack, that extra attack is made with the alternate blade. As a swift action, the guisarme can transform itself into a _staff of enchantment_. If it uses up all of its charges, it automatically reverts to guisarme form. Created to defeat non-spellcasters, the glaive grants its wielder a +2 luck bonus on attacks, saves, and ability and skill checks. It can cast _charm monster_ once per day, _mirror image_ upon its wielder three times per day, and _suggestion_ three times per day.
  With Sorshen's recent shift in alignment, her _Sinuous Guisarme_ finds itself increasingly in conflict with the runelord. Whether this will eventually result in the guisarme's alignment adjusting to match its owner or whether the glaive's fell influence might cause Sorshen to backslide to evil, only time (and GM whim) can tell."
Destruction: |
  "_Sorshen's Sinuous Glaive_ can be destroyed if it is hurled under the crushing feet of the Oliphaunt of Jandelay, but only if there is no current Runelord of Lust living in the world (note that when Sorshen fully takes on the mantle of ruler of New Thassilon, she abandons her role as Runelord of Lust for the purpose of fulfilling this latter requirement for destruction)."
