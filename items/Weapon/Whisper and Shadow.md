Three times per day, _Shadow_ may be used to cast _invisibility_ (CL 10th), or the blade itself can be turned invisible for one round, making it incredibly difficult to parry and dodge. If your opponent cannot see invisible objects and does not succeed on a DC 25 Spot check to follow your arm motions, he is considered flat-footed against all your attacks with _Shadow_ that round."
