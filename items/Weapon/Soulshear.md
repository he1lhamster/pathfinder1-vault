  "Forged by Staunton Vhane with the aid of several Templars of the Ivory Labyrinth, this intelligent _+2 transformative_ _glaive_ is infused with a babau's sentience and eagerness for murder. _Soulshear_ is capable of hiding its evil nature with _misdirection_, and if its wielder's alignment isn't chaotic evil, it delights in infiltrating enemy forces to create personality conflicts with its wielder, manipulating his downfall through acts of conspiracy, betrayal, and murder. Even without dominating those who carry it, _Soulshear_ can occasionally summon a babau demon to clandestinely carry out its will. These summonings often result in unexplained murders, or even the death of _Soulshear's_ owner so the glaive can pass to further victims or be returned to the devoted cultists of Baphomet.
  _Soulshear_ can use _misdirection_ on itself three times per day, typically selecting an unaligned magic item carried by its wielder to hide its evil. Once per day, it can cast _summon monster V_, but only to summon a babau demon."
