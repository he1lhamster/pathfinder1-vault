A chupar pick functions as a _+1 light pick of wounding_. When the _chupar pick_ scores a critical hit, its wielder is affected by a _haste_ effect for 7 rounds as if targeted by a _haste_ spell. Subsequent critical hits made while the wielder is affected extend the duration of the _haste_ effect but have no additional effect."
