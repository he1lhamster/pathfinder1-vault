Description: |
  "This _+1 frost scimitar_ has been forged from a single piece of razor-sharp, super-hardened ice. A _rimeblade_ automatically resizes itself to match the size of its wielder, and if a _rimeblade_ is damaged, the wielder can cause the blade to melt away and reform with full hit points as a full-round action. This ability cannot be used if the weapon is destroyed.
  Once per day on command, the wielder can transform a _rimeblade_ into a beam of ice-cold flame called rimefire. The weapon is still wielded as scimitar, and attacks with the blade-like beam are melee touch attacks that deal 1d8+3 points of cold damage (regardless of the wielder's size). Because the beam is immaterial, the wielder's Strength modifier doesn't apply to damage. In addition, a creature that takes cold damage from the rimefire beam is covered in clinging frost and is entangled for 1 round. The rimefire beam lasts for 1 minute, after which the weapon returns to its normal form.
  In addition, once per day as a swift action before an attack, a _rimeblade's_ wielder can cause the blade to glow with a pale blue radiance. On a successful attack, the _rimeblade_ deals an additional 4d6 points of cold damage and causes the target to be staggered for 1 round. If the attack is a critical hit, the target is staggered for 1 minute instead. This effect ends after a single attack, regardless of whether the attack is successful or not."

### Description

This +1 frost _[[items/Weapon/Scimitar|scimitar]]_ has been forged from a single piece of razor-sharp, super-hardened ice. A _[[items/Weapon/Rimeblade|rimeblade]]_ automatically resizes itself to match the size of its wielder, and if a _rimeblade_ is damaged, the wielder can cause the blade to melt away and reform with full hit points as a full-round action. This ability cannot be used if the weapon is destroyed.

Once per day on _[[spells/Command|command]]_, the wielder can transform a _rimeblade_ into a beam of ice-cold flame _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ rimefire. The weapon is still wielded as _scimitar_, and attacks with the blade-like beam are melee touch attacks that deal 1d8+3 points of cold damage (regardless of the wielder's size). Because the beam is immaterial, the wielder's Strength modifier doesn't apply to damage. In addition, a creature that takes cold damage from the rimefire beam is covered in clinging frost and is _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_ for 1 round. The rimefire beam lasts for 1 minute, after which the weapon returns to its normal form.

In addition, once per day as a swift action before an attack, a _rimeblade_'s wielder can cause the blade to glow with a pale blue _[[items/Weapon/Radiance|radiance]]_. On a successful attack, the _rimeblade_ deals an additional 4d6 points of cold damage and causes the target to be _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1 round. If the attack is a critical hit, the target is _staggered_ for 1 minute instead. This effect ends after a single attack, regardless of whether the attack is successful or not.
