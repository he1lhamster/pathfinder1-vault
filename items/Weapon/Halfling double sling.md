Description: |
  "At first glance resembling a baton-like stick with a sling dangling from each end, this weapon requires extraordinary skill, or halfling acrobatics, to use to full effect. You can use a double sling as a normal sling, or use the second end to make one additional ranged attack each round. You take the normal penalties for fighting with two weapons when you use both ends of a double sling (as if it were a double weapon); the Two- Weapon Fighting feat reduces these penalties as normal. Reloading one end of a double sling is a move action (just like a normal sling), so unless you have an ability or feat (such as Ammo Drop) that allows you to quickly reload a sling, you cannot normally make multiple attacks per round for several consecutive rounds with this weapon.
  You can hurl ordinary stones with a double sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you, and you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls."

### Description

At first glance resembling a baton-like stick with a _[[items/Weapon/Sling|sling]]_ dangling from each end, this weapon requires extraordinary skill, or halfling acrobatics, to use to full effect. You can use a double _sling_ as a normal _sling_, or use the second end to make one additional ranged attack each round. You take the normal penalties for fighting with two weapons when you use both ends of a double _sling_ (as if it were a double weapon); the Two- Weapon Fighting feat reduces these penalties as normal. Reloading one end of a double _sling_ is a move action (just like a normal _sling_), so unless you have an ability or feat (such as _[[feats/Ammo Drop|Ammo Drop]]_) that allows you to quickly reload a _sling_, you cannot normally make multiple attacks per round for several consecutive rounds with this weapon.

You can hurl ordinary stones with a double _sling_, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you, and you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls.
