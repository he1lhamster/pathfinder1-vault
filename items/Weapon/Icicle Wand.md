Description: |
  "This fragile-looking wand appears to be nothing more than a sharpened icicle nearly a foot in length, though it is as sturdy as any wand and the ice never melts. A combination of arcane tool and weapon, _icicle wands_ find frequent use among the winter witches of Irrisen, and traders have carried them as far south as the mountains of Cheliax, Andoran, and Taldor. An _icicle wand_ functions primarily as a _wand of ice spears_ (see page 72), granting its user the ability to create and turn icy terrain against her enemies. In addition, an _icicle wand_ can also be wielded as a masterwork dagger that deals 1 point of cold damage with a successful attack in addition to normal dagger damage. An _icicle wand_ with a caster level of 7th or higher functions as a _+1 frost dagger_ instead."
