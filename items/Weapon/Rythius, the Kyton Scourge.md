Description: |
  "Once possessed by a brijidine azata dedicated to ending the depredations of kytons, this potent magic weapon now holds a portion of her essence. This _+1 shock whip_ is woven from green leather and crackles with electricity, seemingly writhing of its own volition. Three times per day, when the wielder uses _Rythius_ to successfully trip a creature, the target of the trip attack is subject to a _dimensional anchor_ effect. The wielder can choose to suppress this ability as a swift action.
  Furthermore, in the hands of a wielder with a good alignment, the weapon becomes a _+1 kyton bane shock whip_. _Rythius_ is infused with good, and as a result it bestows 1 negative level on any nongood creature wielding it. This negative level persists as long as the weapon is wielded and disappears when the item is put away. The negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by means of _restoration_ spells) while it is wielded."
