  "This heavy blade has a single sharp edge, concave at the bottom and convex at the top, with a hook-shaped hilt. Its shape distributes the weight to give it the momentum of an axe with the cutting edge of a sword, much like a larger version of a kukri. The hooked hilt is sometimes carved to resemble the head of a horse or bird of prey, and may have a thin chain stretched across its opening, acting as a partial guard for the hand and fingers."
