Description: |
  "_Death bills_ are greatly coveted by redcaps, and the loss of a _death bill_ is considered a great shame punishable by exile or even death. A _death bill_ is a _+1 scythe_ that leaves particularly unsightly wounds in its victims' flesh—these wounds do not bleed, and have dry, flaking edges, almost as if the wound had been desiccated by desert winds. Three times per day, the wielder of a _death bill_ can swing the weapon as a standard action to create a scythe-shaped arc of dust that sweeps out from the user in a 30-foot cone. All creatures in this area take 2d4 points of slashing damage plus an amount of additional damage equal to the user's Charisma modifier, and are staggered for 1 round by the pain of having moisture drawn from their bodies by the supernatural effect. A successful DC 13 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the staggered effect. Once per day as a swift action, as a _death bill_ is used to reduce a foe to negative hit points with a melee attack, the user may cast a _death knell_ on that victim (Will DC 13 negates)."
