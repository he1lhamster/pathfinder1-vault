After applying poison or drawing blood, the dart flies through the air back to the creature that fired it. Unlike other featherweight darts, a is not damaged or destroyed when used, and can be reused indefinitely (though it can store only 1 dose of poison or one blood sample at a time).
  Although a _stirge lancet_ leaves no evidence, the sound of its buzzing wings may attract attention. A creature hit by a _stirge lancet_ can attempt a Perception check to hear its humming; the DC for this check is equal to 20 + the &lt;&gt;stirge lancet's"
