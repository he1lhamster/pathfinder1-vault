Description: |
  "This _+2 cruel longsword_ features layers of cold iron and steel folded over one another repeatedly. The blade counts as cold iron for the purpose of overcoming a creature's damage reduction. Whenever a _pactseeker's blade_ successfully deals at least 1 point of damage (after damage reduction) to a target, the weapon also deals damage equal to the weapon's enhancement bonus to each ally that shares an ongoing spell (such as _haste_) with or is otherwise magically bound to the target (such as other members of a hag coven). This damage disregards the range between the weapon's target and such bound creatures, and the damage bypasses damage reduction."
