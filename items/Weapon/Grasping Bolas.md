  "This _+1 bolas_ is favored in the southern Mwangi Expanse, where it is commonly crafted from assassin vines and used as a means of escape from the likes of derhii and jungle-dwelling giants. Once per day, the wielder of a _grasping bolas_ can attempt a special ranged trip combat maneuver check that ignores any size modifiers to CMD the target may possess. If the attempt succeeds, the target falls prone and becomes entangled for 1 round as a mass of animated vines bursts out from within the bolas. For every 5 by which the combat maneuver check exceeds the target's modified CMD, the duration of this condition increases by 1 round. An entangled creature can break free with a successful DC 20 Strength or Escape Artist check.
  The animated ropes employed by a _grasping bolas_ have AC 22, hardness 10, and damage reduction 5/slashing. If a _grasping bolas_ is severed (all 12 hit points are lost to damage), it is destroyed."
