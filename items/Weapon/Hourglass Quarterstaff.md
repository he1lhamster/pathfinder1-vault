Description: |
  "This _+1 disruption/+1 invigorating_ _quarterstaff_ is a sturdy shaft of yew with heavy metal rings at each end. The quarterstaff is thinner in the center than at the ends, giving it the appearance of a very elongated hourglass. The wielder of the _hourglass quarterstaff_ can use _threefold aspect_ once each day, but this spell expires if the _hourglass quarterstaff_ leaves the wielder's hand for more than 1 minute. The wielder instantly knows the age step of any humanoid creature she views; for most creatures, this is young, adult, middle age, old, or venerable. This ability penetrates mundane disguises but not illusions or magical disguises. For example, the wielder would identify a middle-aged halfling masquerading as a human child as middle-aged, but would identify a doppelganger in the form of an old woman as old."
