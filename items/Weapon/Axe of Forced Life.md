Description: |
  "This _+3 battleaxe_ has a well-worn haft and a blackened blade etched with an ouroboros. An _axe of forced life_ briefly disrupts the damage reduction of undead creatures. Once per round when the wielder strikes an undead creature that has DR/bludgeoning, DR/good, DR/magic, or DR/piercing, the wielder can reduce the target's damage reduction by 5 points (to a minimum of 0). This effect lasts for 1 round, and reduces only the types of damage reduction listed. On a confirmed critical hit, the wielder may reduce the target's damage reduction by up to 15 points. The effects of multiple _axes of forced life_ don't stack, and the effects of an _axe of forced life_ do not stack with the effects of a _negating_ weapon.
  Once per day as a move action, the wielder of an _axe of forced life_ may cause life energy to course through the weapon for 1 minute. Doing so causes the axe's ouroboros to shed light as a candle. Thereafter, the first undead creature struck by the axe must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or lose the benefits of all forms of damage reduction it possesses except DR/epic for 1 round."
