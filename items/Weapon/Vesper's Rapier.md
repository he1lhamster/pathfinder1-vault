Description: |
  "Despite its best-known name, _Vesper's Rapier_ is not necessarily a rapier. This weapon is a _+3 keen speed sword_, with the type of sword varying from wielder to wielder. Upon being taken up by a new owner, the weapon transforms into any type of sword of the wielder's choosing, mundane or exotic. From that point on, the weapon always transforms into that type of sword whenever it is held by that individual. While bearing _Vesper's Rapier_, the wielder gains a +4 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks made to influence humanoids, and can use the rapier like a compass to point in the direction of the closest collection of gems, silver, or drinkable water as a standard action at will.
  The sword also grants the wielder the ability to either slip or tighten the bonds of the physical world, granting her the ability to cast _dimension door_, _dimensional lock_, or _greater teleport_. These powers have limits, though, as they can drain the sword's magical abilities for the day— _dimensional lock_ and _greater teleport_ can be used once per day and drain the sword immediately after their use; _dimension door_ can be used at will, but drains the sword after 3 uses, though the wielder can continue to use _dimension door_ even if the sword is drained (this is the only effect that functions even when the sword is drained). If the sword becomes drained, it loses all of its magical properties (aside from _dimension door_), including its +3 enhancement bonus, skill bonuses, and the _keen_ and _speed_ special abilities. All of these properties are restored every day at midnight."
Destruction: |
  "_Vesper's Rapier_ is destroyed if it is taken into a demiplane where time doesn't pass. Although this is the end of the sword, its true owner's existence is such that earlier incarnations of the weapon will continue to exist for ages."
