On a critical hit from a _spine flail_, the victim must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save to resist being permanently blinded by the blow.
  _Spine flails_ are favored by powerful dullahans, who harvest the spines from their first victims. The undead riders have a particular affinity for their personal _spine flails_, and often maintain a supernatural control over their weapons, causing them to appear or disappear at will."
