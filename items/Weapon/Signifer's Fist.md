Description: |
  "This _+1 light mace_ is forged of black iron and topped with what appears to be a clenched fist with spikes protruding from between the fingers. As a move action, the wielder can expend 1 point from his arcane pool (as per a magus), 1 point from his arcane reservoir (as per an arcanist), or one use of fervor (as per a warpriest) to make a single melee attack with the _signifer's fist_. Characters without any of these options can instead activate a signifer's fist in this way as a standard action once per day. If the attack deals damage to a creature, the _signifer's fist_ gains the _bane_ weapon special ability against that creature's type (or subtype if the creature is a humanoid or outsider) for 1 minute. This benefit doesn't apply if the target is immune to bleed, though the attack still deals damage normally."
