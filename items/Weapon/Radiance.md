### Description

In 4692 AR, soon after the start of the Fourth Crusade, a _[[classes/Paladin|paladin]]_ of Iomedae and renowned demon _[[classes/Slayer|slayer]]_ named Yaniel spoke out against the Mendevian crusaders, accusing them of negligence and sloth, and claiming these faults were what allowed Khorramzadeh to invade Kenabres and damage the _[[items/Wondrous Item/Wardstone|wardstone]]_. Her accusations cut too close to the truth, and in a moment of weakness her superiors threatened to excommunicate her. Instead, she said she would enter the Worldwound and fight the Fourth Crusade on her own, with only her magic sword _[[items/Weapon/Radiance|Radiance]]_ for company. The church was happy to see Yaniel go, and in the 2 years that followed, she was thought to have been slain. Yet when she returned to Kenabres in 4694 AR, leading a small army of crusaders she'd rescued, both Yaniel and her superiors had changed. For her part, Yaniel had shed her pride and insubordination, and had gained a new appreciation for the difficult decisions leaders are forced to make. And the church leaders had learned that sometimes the truth is exactly what you need to hear. Alas, Yaniel was assassinated before the year was out, slain by the lilitu demon Minagho only a week into her second personal crusade. Her followers managed to return to Kenabres with _Radiance_, but Yaniel's body had been taken. The sword had gone dark after Yaniel's death, its magical powers apparently lost, and so the crusaders elected to place it in the _[[monsters/Gray|Gray]]_ Garrison on display. Yet several months ago it was stolen by the Templars of the Ivory Labyrinth, who plan to soon send the sword north to Drezen for corruption into a weapon of evil.

_Radiance_ was once a powerful weapon, yet since Yaniel's death the blade has become inert. When handled by a _paladin_, however, the blade suddenly glows with golden light and functions as a +1 cold iron _[[items/Weapon/Longsword|longsword]]_ that radiates light as a _[[items/Mundane/Torch|torch]]_ on _[[spells/Command|command]]_. The weapon shifts and changes its form to match the _paladin_'s deity's favored weapon (in the hands of a _paladin_ who doesn't worship a deity, the weapon remains a +1 _longsword_). Certain events and tasks can _[[spells/Awaken|awaken]]_ _Radiance_'s latent powers, eventually transforming it into a full-fledged _[[items/Weapon/Holy Avenger|holy avenger]]_—these events are noted in the following adventures in Wrath of the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Righteous|Righteous]]_ as they occur.

In addition, _Radiance_ is a legendary item (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 169) that bonds with a mythic _paladin_ a s soon as it is wielded in combat—in this adventure, _Radiance_ bonds if a _paladin_ uses it in the final encounter against Vorlesh's babaus. The weapon has two daily uses of legendary power that _[[spells/Recharge|recharge]]_ each day, but does not currently possess any legendary attributes, for it has yet to be wielded by a mythic _paladin_. As _Radiance_ has its own ability to grow in power, it cannot be given the upgradable legendary item ability.

### _[[spells/Destruction|Destruction]]_

A _paladin_ must knowingly slay an angel with the blade, at which point the sword can be destroyed normally with damage.
