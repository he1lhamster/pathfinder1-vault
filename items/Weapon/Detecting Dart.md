Description: |
  "This tiny dart is made of iron and engraved with runes. The back half of the dart has a colorful tuft of fletching that detaches when the dart is thrown or fired through a blowgun, fluttering to the ground in the user's space. A successful ranged touch attack with the front half of the dart deals 1 point of damage and embeds the needle-like point into the target's flesh. The attack causes little pain, and the target only notices the embedded dart with a successful DC 14 Perception check. Removing the dart takes a standard action and deals 1 additional point of damage.
  Once separated, the back half of the dart detects where the front half is as long as both pieces are within 1 mile of each other. Every hour, the back half gives a distinct hum and its fletching flutters in the direction of the front half for 1 minute. This effect continues for up to 24 hours or until the dart is removed, at which point its magic fades forever.
  Should a creature eat the flesh of a target with an embedded _detecting dart_, it has a 50% chance of consuming the dart. Should the dart transfer from one creature to another in this way, the dart's back half instead tracks the new creature."
