Description: |
  "This _+1 flaming burst brilliant energy longsword_ has a burnished copper hilt and burns with blue and white flame. In the hands of a mythic wielder, the sword's fire damage bypasses fire resistance and fire immunity. As a swift action, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to enable the _sword of inner fire_ to damage nonliving creatures (such as constructs and undead) for 1 round, though the sword still can't damage inanimate objects.
  A wielder of at least 3rd tier can absorb the _sword of inner fire_ into her body as a swift action, and call it back to hand with another swift action. While the sword is stored in this way, her eyes burn with orange flame and she gains a +5 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws."
