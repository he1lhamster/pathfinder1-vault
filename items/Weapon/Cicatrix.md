Description: |
  "When Vildeis reached for a tool to permanently put an end to her sight so she no longer had to bear witness to the evils of the multiverse, her hand fell upon _Cicatrix_. Although even she doesn't know who or what placed the black blade within her grasp, in the ages since it put out its mistress's eyes, the blade has rarely left Vildeis's hand. _Cicatrix_ is a _+5 holy returning vicious dagger_ that counts as both cold iron and silver. Any time _Cicatrix_ deals damage, the creature struck must attempt a DC 25 Will save. If it fails, the wielder instantly knows that creature's alignment and can listen to its surface thoughts, as _detect thoughts_. If the wielder chooses, she can then force the creature to attempt a DC 25 Will save; if the creature fails its saving throw, the wielder may blind the target (as _blindness/deafness_) or inscribe a martyr's mark upon the target. Inscribing a martyr's mark means the wielder takes the damage from the attack instead of the target; the martyr's mark is triggered like a _mark of justice_, but activates a _geas/quest_ of the wielder's choosing instead of _bestow curse_. A martyr's mark can be removed as if it were a _mark of justice_."
Destruction: |
  "_Cicatrix_ is destroyed if an evil outsider of CR 20 or higher uses the blade to sacrifice itself to save a good outsider's life."

### Description

When Vildeis reached for a tool to permanently put an end to her sight so she no longer had to bear _[[spells/Witness|witness]]_ to the evils of the multiverse, her hand fell upon _[[items/Weapon/Cicatrix|Cicatrix]]_. Although even she doesn't know who or what placed the black blade within her _[[spells/Grasp|grasp]]_, in the ages since it put out its mistress's eyes, the blade has rarely left Vildeis's hand. _Cicatrix_ is a +5 holy returning _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_ _[[items/Weapon/Dagger|dagger]]_ that counts as both cold iron and silver. Any time _Cicatrix_ deals damage, the creature struck must attempt a DC 25 Will save. If it fails, the wielder instantly knows that creature's alignment and can listen to its surface thoughts, as _[[spells/Detect Thoughts|detect thoughts]]_. If the wielder chooses, she can then force the creature to attempt a DC 25 Will save; if the creature fails its saving throw, the wielder may blind the target (as blindness/deafness) or inscribe a martyr's mark upon the target. Inscribing a martyr's mark means the wielder takes the damage from the attack instead of the target; the martyr's mark is triggered like a _[[spells/Mark of Justice|mark of justice]]_, but activates a geas/quest of the wielder's choosing instead of _[[spells/Bestow Curse|bestow curse]]_. A martyr's mark can be removed as if it were a _mark of justice_.
