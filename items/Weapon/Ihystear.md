Description: |
  "Written of only in the most cultic lore of Heaven and Hell, this foot-long sliver of radiance is said to be the final piece of the spear Asmodeus used to slay his brother Ihys. Glowing like a shard of the sun, this strange weapon functions as a _+5 axiomatic brilliant energy dagger_ that overcomes all damage reduction. Any creature of or near deity-level power (including archdevils, demon lords, empyreal lords, Horsemen, and similar beings) wounded by the _Ihystear_ must succeed at a DC 35 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round.
  Aside from its use as a weapon, the fragment holds within it the final scream of Ihys—the cry of the first murder and of the first slain deity. As a full-round action, a creature bearing the Ihystear that succeeds at a DC 30 Strength check can snap the weapon in half. Doing so releases an echo of this scream: a terrible, deafening shriek that pierces the world and can be heard for dozens of miles. Any creature within 100 feet of the broken _Ihystear_ —including the wielder—must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be slain instantly. Those who succeed at their saves are rendered deaf and insane (as per the spells _blindness/deafness_ and _insanity_). This scream continues for 3 rounds and pierces even magical silence. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect. At the end of this time, the _Ihystear_ heals itself and returns to normal. However, there is a 50% chance each time it is broken that it randomly shifts to another plane.
  For long centuries, Asmodeus held the _Ihystear_ within the Catafalque, deep in Nessus, though in recent years rumors claim sightings of the weapon on Golarion. Whether these tales are true and why the Prince of Darkness might have released his trophy after untold millennia remains mysteries."
Destruction: |
  "The _Ihystear_ must be used to strike the same type of fatal blow to Asmodeus that the Prince of Darkness used upon Ihys—but none living other than Asmodeus know exactly what type of fatal blow this was. This does not slay Asmodeus, but it does cause the _Ihystear_ to vanish from existence for 9 years, 9 months, and 9 days. After this time, if Asmodeus still lives, the _Ihystear_ reappears in the Catafalque."

### Description

Written of only in the most cultic lore of Heaven and Hell, this foot-long sliver of _[[items/Weapon/Radiance|radiance]]_ is said to be the final piece of the _[[items/Weapon/Spear|spear]]_ Asmodeus used to slay his brother Ihys. Glowing like a shard of the sun, this strange weapon functions as a +5 _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Axiomatic|axiomatic]]_ _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Brilliant Energy|brilliant energy]]_ _[[items/Weapon/Dagger|dagger]]_ that overcomes all _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_. Any creature of or near deity-level power (including archdevils, demon lords, empyreal lords, Horsemen, and similar beings) wounded by the _[[items/Weapon/Ihystear|Ihystear]]_ must succeed at a DC 35 Fortitude save or be _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_ for 1 round.

Aside from its use as a weapon, the fragment holds within it the final scream of Ihys—the cry of the first murder and of the first slain deity. As a full-round action, a creature bearing the _Ihystear_ that succeeds at a DC 30 Strength check can snap the weapon in half. Doing so releases an _[[spells/Echo|echo]]_ of this scream: a terrible, deafening shriek that pierces the world and can be heard for dozens of miles. Any creature within 100 feet of the _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ _Ihystear_ —including the wielder—must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be slain instantly. Those who succeed at their saves are rendered deaf and insane (as per the spells blindness/deafness and _[[spells/Insanity|insanity]]_). This scream continues for 3 rounds and pierces even magical _[[spells/Silence|silence]]_. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect. At the end of this time, the _Ihystear_ heals itself and returns to normal. However, there is a 50% chance each time it is _broken_ that it randomly shifts to another plane.

For long centuries, Asmodeus held the _Ihystear_ within the Catafalque, deep in Nessus, though in recent years rumors claim sightings of the weapon on Golarion. Whether these tales are true and why the Prince of _[[spells/Darkness|Darkness]]_ might have released his trophy after untold millennia remains mysteries.

### _[[spells/Destruction|Destruction]]_

The _Ihystear_ must be used to strike the same type of fatal blow to Asmodeus that the Prince of _Darkness_ used upon Ihys—but none living other than Asmodeus know exactly what type of fatal blow this was. This does not slay Asmodeus, but it does cause the _Ihystear_ to _[[spells/Vanish|vanish]]_ from existence for 9 years, 9 months, and 9 days. After this time, if Asmodeus still lives, the _Ihystear_ reappears in the Catafalque.
