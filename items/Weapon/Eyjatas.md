Description: |
  "Barbatos wields a potent weapon named _Eyjatas_, a _+4 speed unholy quarterstaff_ embedded with innumerable inhuman eyeballs. Three times per day when striking a creature with _Eyjatas_, its wielder can rip the target's eyes out, permanently blinding it and dealing 2d6 points of bleed damage. A creature can resist this effect with a successful DC 30 Fortitude save, but no save is allowed if the attack was a confirmed critical hit. Once _Eyjatas_ rips out a creature's eyes, it functions as a _bane_ weapon against that target.
  Three times per day, the wielder of _Eyjatas_ can cast _prying eyes_. In addition, the wielder can use _arcane eye_ at will, even on other planes viewed through _scrying_, and can use _eyebite_ (DC 20) at will within 30 feet of the _arcane eye_."
Destruction: |
  "To destroy _Eyjatas_, the quarterstaff's dozens of eyes must be blinded by the purifying light of an unwavering truth spoken by an immortal that has only ever spoken lies in its life. Once the eyes are blinded in this way, the staff must be hurled into a magical portal that has no entrance and that leads nowhere."
