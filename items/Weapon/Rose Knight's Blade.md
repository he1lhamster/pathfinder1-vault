  "This elegant mithral sword bears a blooming rose on the crossguard, with vines winding around the hilt.

Scarlet Rose agents have since been successful in creating new _rose knight's blades_, and the weapons are increasingly seeing use among these Gray Maidens and their affiliates.
  A _rose knight's blade_ is a _+1 benevolent mithral longsword_. Along with its _benevolence_ special ability, this sword can also provide aid by metaphorically cutting through certain debilitating effects. Three times per day, the wielder of a _rose knight's blade_ can attempt a new saving throw against one of the following conditions affecting her: dazed, frightened, nauseated, panicked, paralyzed, shaken, staggered, or stunned— but only if the condition was caused by a mind-affecting effect.
  Alternatively, the wielder can expend one daily use and touch the blade to an adjacent creature as a standard action to remove one of these mind-affecting conditions from the ally."
