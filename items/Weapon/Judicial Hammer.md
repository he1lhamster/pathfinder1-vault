Description: |
  "The head of this _+1 earth breaker_ (_Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment_ 27) is shaped like a massive version of the gavel one might see in a court of law—the weapon is nearly 4 feet long from end to end. The Hellknights of Citadel Vraid are attributed with crafting the first _judicial hammers_, having adopted their form from the weapons of the same Shoanti tribes they used the _judicial hammers_ against. Once per day, the wielder may speak the _judicial hammer's_ command word and name a specific crime he believes an individual within 30 feet has committed. Whenever the designated target takes damage from the _judicial hammer_, the target must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or immediately and truthfully confess its innocence or guilt in the named crime (if the target can speak the same language as the wielder of the _judicial hammer_, it must confess in this language). This effect lasts for 24 hours or until the creature fails its Will save, whichever comes first."
