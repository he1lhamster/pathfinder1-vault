  "A skull and partial backbone carved from ivory top this _+2 sword cane_ (_Advanced Player's Guide_ 179), and gray sharkskin covers its wooden scabbard. The wielder can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to attack rolls with a _scoundrel's sword cane_ sized for her, even though it isn't a light weapon.
  The eyes of the skull atop the _scoundrel's sword cane_ constantly enhance the wielder's awareness, granting the wielder a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks. In addition, once per day, the wielder can concentrate while holding the cane to see through the skull's eyes as if they were her own. In effect, the _scoundrel's sword cane_ can be used as a periscope, allowing the wielder to safely peer over obstacles or around corners. If the wielder has total concealment from an observed creature except for the end of the cane, the wielder uses the skull's Diminutive size modifier for her Stealth check instead of her own size modifier."
