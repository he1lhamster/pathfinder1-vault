  "Adorned with bone fetishes, feathers, leaves, and gnarled branches, each of which carries its own significance, this _+1 shortspear_ is often found in the hands of the tribal Mwangi who serve the powerful spirits known as wendifa— the juju oracles. Each _wendifisa spear_ (literally "spear of those who serve the wendifa") is created alongside a specially crafted onyx gem. If this gem is within 100 feet of the wielder and the wielder's hit points are reduced below 0, the gem shatters. When the gem shatters, the wielder of the _wendifisa spear_ is immediately slain, and animates 1 round later as a juju zombie (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2_ 291).
  If the gem is held by anyone other than the spear's wielder when the wielder is slain (and the gem shatters), the creature holding the gem gains 1d8 temporary hit points, a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength, and a +1 bonus to its effective caster level. These bonuses last 1 hour.
  After the onyx shatters, the weapon is treated as a _+1 shortspear_."

### Description

Adorned with bone fetishes, feathers, leaves, and gnarled branches, each of which carries its own significance, this +1 _[[items/Weapon/Shortspear|shortspear]]_ is often found in the hands of the tribal Mwangi who serve the powerful spirits known as wendifa— the juju oracles. Each _[[items/Weapon/Wendifisa Spear|wendifisa spear]]_ (literally "_[[items/Weapon/Spear|spear]]_ of those who serve the wendifa") is created alongside a specially crafted onyx gem. If this gem is within 100 feet of the wielder and the wielder's hit points are reduced below 0, the gem shatters. When the gem shatters, the wielder of the _wendifisa spear_ is immediately slain, and animates 1 round later as a juju zombie (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 291).

If the gem is held by anyone other than the _spear_'s wielder when the wielder is slain (and the gem shatters), the creature holding the gem gains 1d8 temporary hit points, a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength, and a +1 bonus to its effective caster level. These bonuses last 1 hour.

After the onyx shatters, the weapon is treated as a +1 _shortspear_.
