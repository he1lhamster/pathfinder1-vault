Description: |
  "This plain-looking _+1 spring blade_ is attached to a weatherbeaten cedar grip. By speaking a command word, the wielder can magically merge the grip into a larger wood handle, such as a cane, club, staff, stylus, or oar, transforming the infused item into either a _+1 shortspear_, _+1 spear_, or _+1 siangham_ (depending on the handle's size). The blade can even be affixed to magic items such as staves, rods, and wands so long as they are made of wood, but doing so renders their other magical properties nonfunctional until the _grafting blade_ is removed.
  Removing a _grafting blade_ from an item it has merged with requires a full-round action, and leaves both items unharmed."
