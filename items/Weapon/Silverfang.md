Description: |
  "_Silverfang_ is a _+1 undead bane mithral rapier_ originally forged by a cabal of vampire hunters in Ustalav as a weapon against their hated foes. Ironically, the rapier was claimed by a powerful Nidalese vampire named Volsazni Dezarr as a trophy after he single-handedly slew the entire cabal during their foolish attempt to destroy him. Since then, Volsazni has bequeathed the weapon as a token of his favor to no fewer than a dozen vampiric thralls and five of his dhampir children—Gnaeus being the latest of these recipients.
  As long as _Silverfang_ is carried, the user gains a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws against negative energy and level drain, and whenever he makes a Fortitude save to recover from a negative level, he may roll the save twice, taking the better of the two results as the actual result. Once per day, _Silverfang_ can target an undead creature it just successfully critically hit with a _halt undead_ effect (Will DC 14 negates) as a swift action."
