  "This _+1 keen returning mithral dagger_ is bleached pale white like some sort of giant tooth. The wielder can expend one use of mythic power when throwing the dagger. When the dagger is thrown in this fashion and hits its target, it can be directed to strike a different target within 30 feet of the first. The new target must still be within the attacker's line of sight. This additional attack is made using the same attack bonus as the first, though range penalties apply based on the total distance the dagger flies.
  The dagger's wielder can continue selecting additional targets within his line of sight until the dagger misses, though no creature can be targeted by the dagger more than once in the same round."
