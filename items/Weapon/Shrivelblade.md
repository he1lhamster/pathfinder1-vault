  "This _+1 adamantine swordbreaker dagger_ (_Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment_ 38) has a jagged ebon blade inscribed with ancient Thassilonian runes that translate to "cut down to size." Three times per day, when the wielder successfully sunders a weapon using a _shrivelblade_, he can permanently reduce the size of the sundered weapon by one size category, thus reducing its damage and its intended wielder size by one size category and its weight by half. Using this ability is a swift action. If the sundered weapon is magical, it can attempt a DC 14 Will save to negate this effect. Multiple uses of this ability don't stack. A _make whole_ spell can return a weapon shrunken by a _shrivelblade_ to its proper size."
