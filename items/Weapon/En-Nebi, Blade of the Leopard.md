Description: |
  "Crafted in Katapesh some 300 years ago, En-Nebi is a katar some 15 inches in length. An embossed image of a ferocious Katapeshi leopard adorns the weapon's hilt, while strange shadowy patterns writhe across its damascened blade, even in strong light.
  In combat, En-Nebi is treated as a _+1 vicious punch dagger_. As it strikes, the extra damage from the vicious property manifests as if a great cat's claws had cruelly raked the victim's flesh. While this effect can be unnerving, the consequences for the katar's wielder are even worse: if he confirms a critical hit with the weapon, he must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or contract a form of lycanthropy, becoming a Katapeshi wereleopard lycanthrope.
  Easily twice the size of common leopards, Katapeshi leopards are infamous for their savagery. Now extremely rare, these massive creatures once ranged from Nex to Thuvia (same stats as tigers). Treat Katapeshi wereleopard lycanthropes as chaotic evil weretigers."
