  "This simply made _+1 dancing shortsword_ leaps to hand at the slightest touch. It can be drawn as a free action as though using the Quick Draw feat. The _cutthroat's apprentice_ dances for 8 rounds instead of 4 when activated, but can only dance twice per day. When dancing and attacking a creature, it moves into the target's space and provides the person who activated it (but no other creatures) with flanking during his turn if he attacks the same target in melee. Once the sword's activator completes his turn, the sword moves back to her space. If directed to attack multiple creatures in the same turn, the _cutthroat's apprentice_ provides a flank against only the last creature attacked."
