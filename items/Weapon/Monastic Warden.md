Description: |
  "This _+1 ki focus temple sword_ is often gifted to select students. A character making an attack with this blade can spend 1 ki point as a swift action to ignore any shield bonus to AC her target has for that attack.
  Three times per day, the wielder of the _monastic warden_ can slash the air in her target's direction, causing a shimmering copy of the sword formed of white light to streak toward the target. The wielder must make a ranged touch attack against the target. A creature struck by the shimmering blade takes 4d8 points of force damage. If the target is struck while on the grounds of a site sacred to the wielder, the target instead takes 8d6 points of force damage and is dazed for 1 round. A successful DC 14 Will saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the daze effect."
