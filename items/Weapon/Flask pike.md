  "This pike has a hollow spot near its tip into which a flask can be strapped. If the flask is filled with an alchemical splash weapon and you hit a creature with the pike, the target is also hit with the splash weapon. This uses up the contents of the flask. Because of the added weight of a flask, attacks with the flask pike take a –2 penalty when it's loaded with one. Reloading the flask pike is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity."
