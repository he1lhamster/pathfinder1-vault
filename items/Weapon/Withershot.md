Description: |
  "This _+2 shock musket_ is inscribed with imagery of storms and plagues, glorifying the daemonic harbinger Cixyron. When a bullet fired from a _withershot_ strikes a good- or neutral-aligned target, it burrows into the target's flesh and infects the target with cackle fever (_Core Rulebook_ 557). Infected creatures can resist the disease normally, but can't be cured or recover lost ability damage until the cursed bullet is removed (this requires a successful DC 15 Heal check or a _restoration_ spell). Additional bullet impacts do not increase the effects, but each bullet must be removed before the target can be cured of its disease."
