Description: |
  "A _bonespur dagger_ appears to have been crafted from a humanoid radius and ulna, sharpened to a razor edge and needle point just below where the elbow would be located and fitted with a hilt made of wood and bone. While the weapon looks fragile, the magic that infuses the grisly blade tempers and strengthens it to the level of steel. A bonespur dagger functions as a _+1 punching dagger_, save that on a successful critical hit, the weapon strikes bone and cracks it. The creature so struck must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to resist suffering a -2 penalty to Strength for 1 minute from this pain; penalties from multiple successful critical hits stack up to 3 times.
  As a curious side effect, bonespur daggers penetrate the damage reduction of animated skeletons and skeletal champions (but not other skeletal undead) as if they were bludgeoning weapons rather than piercing weapons."
