Description: |
  "This _+1 scorpion whip_ is made from the tail of a giant cave scorpion. Three times per day, it allows the wielder to use a _poison_ effect (as the spell, save DC 15) upon a creature struck by the whip. The wielder can decide to use the power after she has struck. Doing so is a free action, but the _poison_ effect must be invoked in the same round that the whip strikes.
  In addition, the _fleshwarped scorpion's tail_ can be attached to (or removed from) a willing or helpless creature with 1 hour of surgery and a successful DC 20 Heal check. Whether or not the surgery is successful, the creature takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage. While the tail is attached, the creature gains a natural sting attack that deals damage as the _fleshwarped scorpion's tail_ (including the enhancement bonus and ability to use the poison effect three times per day). The save DC for the _poison_ effect becomes 10 + 1/2 the creature's Hit Dice + its Constitution modifier."
