Description: |
  "_Ukwar_ is a _+1 conductive battleaxe_ infused with the angry spirit of a Deadwatcher orc leader named Ukwar. After perishing in Scarwall and rising soon thereafter as a fext, Ukwar spent decades longing to be free of her curse. When she is permanently slain, her spirit enters her axe. As long as the PCs continue to adventure in Scarwall, she doesn't attempt to exert influence over her wielder—she wants to see each and every one of Scarwall's denizens suffer. If her wielder spends more than 1 day outside of Scarwall (and the castle remains cursed), she attempts to take control and force her wielder to return and finish this job.
  As long as _Ukwar_ remains intelligent, the blade grants weapon proficiency with the battleaxe to her wielder. If the wielder is already proficient with battleaxes, he instead gains a +1 bonus on all attack rolls and damage rolls made with _Ukwar_. She imposes negative levels on nonchaotic evil wielders only when they are outside of Scarwall. She can cast _rage_ once per day, and does so on her wielder the first time each day he attacks one of the spirit anchors or the chained spirit—she can be convinced to cast _rage_ on her wielder at another time with a successful DC 20 Diplomacy or Intimidate check (a standard action)."

### Description

_[[items/Weapon/Ukwar|Ukwar]]_ is a +1 _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Conductive|conductive]]_ _[[items/Weapon/Battleaxe|battleaxe]]_ infused with the angry spirit of a Deadwatcher _[[monsters/Orc|orc]]_ leader named _Ukwar_. After perishing in Scarwall and rising soon thereafter as a _[[monsters/Fext|fext]]_, _Ukwar_ spent decades longing to be free of her curse. When she is permanently slain, her spirit enters her axe. As long as the PCs continue to adventure in Scarwall, she doesn't attempt to exert influence over her wielder—she wants to see each and every one of Scarwall's denizens suffer. If her wielder spends more than 1 day outside of Scarwall (and the castle remains cursed), she attempts to take control and force her wielder to return and finish this job.

As long as _Ukwar_ remains intelligent, the blade grants weapon proficiency with the _battleaxe_ to her wielder. If the wielder is already proficient with battleaxes, he instead gains a +1 bonus on all attack rolls and damage rolls made with _Ukwar_. She imposes negative levels on nonchaotic evil wielders only when they are outside of Scarwall. She can cast _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ once per day, and does so on her wielder the first time each day he attacks one of the spirit anchors or the _[[monsters/Chained Spirit|chained spirit]]_—she can be convinced to cast _rage_ on her wielder at another time with a successful DC 20 Diplomacy or Intimidate check (a standard action).

_Ukwar_'s special purpose is to lift Scarwall's curse, and as long as her wielder is engaged in this quest and is within Scarwall, the weapon functions as a +1 _conductive_ undead-bane
