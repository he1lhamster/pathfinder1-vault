  "A light flail consists of a weighted striking end connected to a handle by a sturdy chain. Though often imagined as a ball, sometimes spiked like the head of a morningstar, the head of a light flail can actually take many different shapes, such as short bars. Military flails are sturdier evolutions of agricultural flails, which are used for threshing—beating stacks of grains to separate the useful grains from their husks."
