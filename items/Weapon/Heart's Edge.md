  "This gleaming silver sword has a spray of quillons resembling a sunburst and a pommel shaped like a pair of hands clasped together.

In addition, if a shapechanged creature or creature under the effects of a spell of the polymorph subschool is struck by the sword with a successful melee attack, that creature must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or immediately revert to its true form.
  Lastly, _Heart's Edge_ grants the following abilities when wielded by a good creature. The wielder gains a +6 sacred bonus to her AC and 60 additional hit points. As a swift action up to eight times per day, the wielder can gain a sacred bonus equal to the sword's enhancement bonus on a single Charisma-based skill check or Charisma ability check. As a standard action three times per day, the wielder can force an evil creature to reflect on its past misdeeds and be overcome by grief, as per _forced repentance_ (_Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide_ 224; Will DC 16 negates). Once per day, the wielder can swing _Heart's Edge_ above her head as a standard action to create and launch a globe of searing radiance, as per sunburst (Reflex DC 22 partial)."

  "If a paladin of Iomedae uses _Heart's Edge_ to deliver a coup de grace attack to Iomedae's current herald, who must offer the paladin its unconditional surrender, the sword shatters and is permanently destroyed."
