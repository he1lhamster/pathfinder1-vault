Description: |
  "The Shackles are rife with tales of legendary treasures, but the story of the loss of _Aiger's Kiss_ has seen a resurgence of late, it being the 25th anniversary of the blade's loss in the Black Tower near the Cannibal Isles. Wielded before that loss by Captain Tevenida Aiger—and rumored to have been given to her by Norgorber's herald as a reward for an unknown task— _Aiger's Kiss_ is said to have been a particularly potent weapon against outsiders. In addition to being a notorious pirate captain, Tevenida Aiger was a priestess of Norgorber, and her specialty was the capture of Chelish warships, particularly those employing devils or other extraplanar defenses. Some whisper that Captain Aiger and her sword vanished in the Black Tower due to a Chelish trap set in the structure, but in fact her fate was much grimmer than that (see Part Three of "The Price of Infamy" for details).
  _Aiger's Kiss_ is a _short sword of the planes_ (_Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook_ 477). Three times per day, it can be used to cast _dimensional anchor_ on a creature the sword has just struck— activating this effect is a swift action for the sword's wielder. If the strike is a critical hit, the effect gains a +10 bonus on its caster level check to penetrate the target's spell resistance, if any.
  The weapon's greatest power, though, is its ability to destroy portals or seal planar rifts. Once per year, _Aiger's Kiss_ can be plunged into an extraplanar portal as a standard action—doing so immediately results in two effects. First, it targets the portal with a _mage's disjunction_ (this effect lasts for as long as the sword remains in the portal). Second, as long as the sword remains lodged in the portal, it becomes affected by an _antipathy_ effect against all outsiders. Once removed from a portal, it takes the sword a year to build up its magic to be able to use this ability again."
Destruction: |
  "If _Aiger's Kiss_ is used to attempt to seal a planar rift from the Material Plane to an extraplanar realm under Norgorber's control, the sword is immediately destroyed and the planar rift is unharmed—in fact, doing so immediately summons the herald of Norgorber to the site to claim the fragments of the sword and punish those who destroyed it."

### Description

The Shackles are rife with tales of legendary treasures, but the story of the loss of _[[items/Weapon/Aiger's Kiss|Aiger's Kiss]]_ has seen a resurgence of late, it being the 25th anniversary of the blade's loss in the Black Tower near the Cannibal Isles. Wielded before that loss by Captain Tevenida Aiger—and rumored to have been given to her by Norgorber's herald as a reward for an _[[monsters/Unknown|unknown]]_ task— _Aiger's Kiss_ is said to have been a particularly _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ weapon against outsiders. In addition to being a notorious _[[npcs/Pirate Captain|pirate captain]]_, Tevenida Aiger was a priestess of Norgorber, and her specialty was the capture of Chelish warships, particularly those employing devils or other extraplanar defenses. Some whisper that Captain Aiger and her sword vanished in the Black Tower due to a Chelish trap set in the structure, but in fact her fate was much grimmer than that (see Part Three of "The Price of Infamy" for details).

_Aiger's Kiss_ is a short _[[items/Weapon/Sword of the Planes|sword of the planes]]_ (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 477). Three times per day, it can be used to cast _[[spells/Dimensional Anchor|dimensional anchor]]_ on a creature the sword has just struck— activating this effect is a swift action for the sword's wielder. If the strike is a critical hit, the effect gains a +10 bonus on its caster level check to penetrate the target's _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_, if any.

The weapon's greatest power, though, is its ability to destroy portals or seal _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Planar|planar]]_ rifts. Once per year, _Aiger's Kiss_ can be plunged into an extraplanar portal as a standard action—doing so immediately results in two effects. First, it targets the portal with a _[[spells/Mage's Disjunction|mage's disjunction]]_ (this effect lasts for as long as the sword remains in the portal). Second, as long as the sword remains lodged in the portal, it becomes affected by an _[[spells/Antipathy|antipathy]]_ effect against all outsiders. Once removed from a portal, it takes the sword a year to build up its magic to be able to use this ability again.

### _[[spells/Destruction|Destruction]]_

If _Aiger's Kiss_ is used to attempt to seal a _planar_ rift from the Material Plane to an extraplanar realm under Norgorber's control, the sword is immediately destroyed and the _planar_ rift is unharmed—in fact, doing so immediately summons the herald of Norgorber to the site to claim the fragments of the sword and punish those who destroyed it.
