  "Soon after the founding of Thassilon, the ancient emperor Xin crafted the _Alara'quin_, seven icons symbolizing the runelords' mastery of rune magic and dominance over their respective domains. Karzoug's _+2 flaming dancing glaive_ is one of these ancient weapons.
  _Karzoug's burning glaive_ possesses a keen intellect, granted to it by its imperial creator. Meant to embody all that is right and virtuous about the luxury of wealth, the weapon is only concerned with the acquisition of riches and safeguarding the treasures of the rightful runelord of Shalast. It eagerly seeks to immolate non-spellcasters, which it sees as paupers likely to steal what its master possesses. While the glaive endlessly fawns over Karzoug (as it would over any rightful ruler of Shalast), it tirelessly berates other wielders, constantly comparing their flaws to the perfection of its past runelord owners."
Destruction: |
  "_Karzoug's burning glaive_ can be destroyed by hurling it under the crushing feet of the Oliphaunt of Jandelay, although only so long as no current runelord of greed lives in the world."
