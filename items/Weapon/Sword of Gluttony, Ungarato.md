Description: |
  "This _+5 ghost touch vicious falchion_ has a misty, ethereal quality that makes it appear to be spectral in nature despite being perfectly tangible to the touch. Anytime _Ungarato's_ wielder takes damage from the weapon's _vicious_ special ability he adds an amount equal to that damage to his next attack roll. _Ungarato_ faintly glows a sickly, unsettling green anytime there is an undead creature within 50 feet of the wielder. Whenever the falchion strikes a foe, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or take an additional 1d6 points of damage, which the sword's wielder gains as bonus hit points that last for the next hour. If the sword scores a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or be slain outright, with half of its remaining hit points passing to the sword's wielder as bonus hit points. Any creature slain by _Ungarato_ —either as the effect of a critical hit or otherwise—reanimates as a juju zombie (see _Bestiary 2_) 1d4 rounds later under the control of the sword wielder. The sword can control up to 32 HD worth of juju zombies in this way. If this amount is exceeded, undead are released from control as per _animate dead_.
  **Dormancy** The _Alara'hai_ were crafted to serve the runelords of Thassilon. In modern times, however, these runelords lie dead or dormant. With no lords to serve, the weapons of their champions lie dormant as well, reducing each to a +2 weapon with the noted weapon special abilities (those detailed on page 469 of the _Core Rulebook_) but no other properties. The only way to awaken one of the blades is to restore its runelord master to active life or have some other legitimate ruler take up its master's mantle (the weapon determines what is considered legitimate). The swords can detect such restorations and f lare to full power immediately, demanding their wielder seek out the restored runelord and swear eternal fealty."
Destruction: |
  "Each of the _Seven Swords of Sin_ can be destroyed merely if commanded to break. That command, however, must come from the rightful runelord of the nation and school of magic associated with the blade."
