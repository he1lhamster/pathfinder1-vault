  "Arnlaugr's legendary blade, _Rixbrand_, is a double-sided blade of folded blue steel, intricately engraved with ancient runes that light up with electric flame in the presence of dragonkind. The hilt is inlaid with ebony and wrapped with silver wire; the pommel features two silvered dragon heads.
  _Rixbrand_ is a _+3 wounding dragon-bane greatsword_. When the blade scores a critical hit on a dragon, the dragon heads on its pommel spit boiling acid into the wound hewn by the blade. This deals an additional 1d10 points of acid damage and 1d10 points of fire damage to the dragon. Rixbrand's wielder gains a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws against breath weapons, spelllike abilities, and spells from dragons.
  Since Arnlaugr's death, several duplicates of the legendary sword have been created. These blades have been wielded by mercenaries and adventurers alike, although they tend to end up in dragon hoards when their would-be dragonslayer wielders tackle something beyond their ability to endure even with the blade in hand— the same fate that befell the original sword in Arnlaugr's hands."
