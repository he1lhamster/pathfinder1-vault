Description: |
  "_Whispering Shrike_ is a _+1 wakizashi_ (_Ultimate Combat_ 134) of incredibly beautiful design. The sword is etched with images of seven shrikes perched on a coiling branch that runs the length of the blade. Once per day, _Whispering Shrike_ can be used to cast _shield other_ on any creature touched by the blade while you wield it. The blade's _tsuka_ (hilt) has not weathered the passage of time as well as the blade itself, and until the pommel is repaired (a process requiring 600 gp, a day's work, and a DC 20 Craft [weapons] check), attacks with the weapon take a -2 penalty due to the loose grip. A DC 20 Perception check (an automatic success once repair is underway) reveals a secret compartment in the hilt just large enough to hold a small item such as a flask or rolled piece of paper. This compartment currently holds an important letter-see page 22 for details on this find."
