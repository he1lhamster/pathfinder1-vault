Description: |
  "A scene of imperial decadences depicted in fantastically fine etchings—which seem to change upon each consideration— covers the surface of this _+5 short sword_. Every time _Shin-Tari_ successfully damages a creature, it gains the _bane_ weapon special ability, with the target's creature type being its designated foe. This additional weapon quality actives after the weapon first strikes an opponent, granting additional damage to subsequent attacks but not the first attack. The _bane_ weapon special ability persists for the rest of the day, or until the sword strikes a foe of a different creature type. Additionally, whenever _Shin-Tari_ strikes a Large or smaller foe, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be affected as per the spell _dimension door_. This effect functions as the spell, but _Shin-Tari's_ wielder determines where his opponent is transported to, and the destination must be within the wielder's line of sight. The wielder cannot teleport an opponent into a space occupied by another creature or a solid object. Only one creature can be affected by this ability each round, and the target can act as normal on its next turn. If the sword scores a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be affected by the spell _teleport_. The sword's wielder determines the destination, which must be very familiar to him.
  **Dormancy** The _Alara'hai_ were crafted to serve the runelords of Thassilon. In modern times, however, these runelords lie dead or dormant. With no lords to serve, the weapons of their champions lie dormant as well, reducing each to a +2 weapon with the noted weapon special abilities (those detailed on page 469 of the _Core Rulebook_) but no other properties. The only way to awaken one of the blades is to restore its runelord master to active life or have some other legitimate ruler take up its master's mantle (the weapon determines what is considered legitimate). The swords can detect such restorations and f lare to full power immediately, demanding their wielder seek out the restored runelord and swear eternal fealty."
Destruction: |
  "Each of the _Seven Swords of Sin_ can be destroyed merely if commanded to break. That command, however, must come from the rightful runelord of the nation and school of magic associated with the blade."
