Description: |
  "This golden-bladed _+1 glorious undead bane katana_ shines like the first rays of the morning sun. Whenever the wielder of a _blade of the rising sun_ threatens a critical threat (regardless of whether the critical is confirmed or whether the target is subject to critical hits), the target is surrounded by a halo of golden sunlight equivalent to _faerie fire_ until the beginning of the wielder's next turn. Undead surrounded by this glow take 1d6 points of damage at the beginning of their turn.
  The wielder of a _blade of the rising sun_ may declare a sacrificial strike (similar to the retributive strike of a _staff of power_) as a standard action, or as an immediate action before losing consciousness upon gaining the dying or dead condition. A sacrificial strike converts the wielder's body and spirit into raw energy equivalent to a _sunburst_ (DC 22). Allies of the wielder within the sunburst are not harmed, and the wielder may choose to affect all allies within the _sunburst_ as _mass cure light wounds_ or all allies within 10 feet as _breath of life_. The caster level for the effects of the sacrificial strike is equal to the sword's caster level plus 1/2 the wielder's level (maximum 25th level).
  A sacrificial strike destroys the wielder's body (as the spell _disintegrate_), but she has a 50% chance of being reincarnated (as the _reincarnate_ spell) 24 hours after performing a sacrificial strike in a random safe location within 1 mile. The wielder's gear is left behind unharmed after the sacrificial strike; however, the _blade of the rising sun_ is teleported to a random location at least 100 miles distant."
