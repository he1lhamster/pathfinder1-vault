  The _oathbow_ may only have one sworn enemy at a time. Once the wielder swears to slay a target, he cannot make a new oath until he has slain that target or 7 days have passed. Even if the wielder slays the sworn enemy on the same day that he makes the oath, he cannot activate the _oathbow's_ special power again until 24 hours have passed from the time he made the oath."
