Description: |
  "This black iron lantern and chain functions as a _+1 heavy flail_. The lantern burns with a cold blue-green flame that sheds light as per a hooded lantern. On command, the wielder can reduce the light to a 5-foot radius of dim light or restore it to full brightness.
  Once per day, when the wielder hits a creature with the lantern, she can deal an additional 2d6 points of negative energy damage as a swift action. If she does so, she gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage she dealt that last for 1 hour.
  A creature reduced to 0 hit points or fewer by the lantern must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or die. This is a death effect. For 24 hours after a creature is killed this way, the lantern's flame holds an echo of the creature's soul. A _speak with dead_ spell cast on the flame yields information as if it were the creature's corpse. The flame can hold the echo of only one creature's soul; if the lantern kills another creature, a new echo replaces the previous one."
