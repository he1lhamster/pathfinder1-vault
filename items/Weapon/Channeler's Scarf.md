Description: |
  "This bladed scarf is made of fine, silvery blue silk. Members of the mystery cult of Ashava—the True Spark and a deified azata—first created _channeler's scarves_, but spiritually inclined members of many other faiths also prize them.
  A channeler's scarf is a _+1 mithral bladed scarf_. When one is wielded by a spiritualist whose phantom is currently harbored in her consciousness, some of the phantom's emotional energy is channeled into the scarf. As long as the wielder's phantom is harbored in her consciousness, once per day she can activate the scarf as a standard action to affect it with a _greater magic weapon_ spell, using the wielder's spiritualist level as the spell's caster level. This effect's duration is equal to 1 minute per the wielder's spiritualist level. This duration need not be used all at once, but must be used in 1-minute increments.
  In addition, while the scarf is under this _greater magic weapon_ effect, it gains a single weapon special ability based on the emotional focus of the wielder's phantom, as though affected by a _spirit-bound blade_ spell. If the phantom's emotional focus does not have an entry for spirit-bound blade, the weapon gains the _heartseeker_ special ability. This effect does not grant the scarf any other benefits of the _spirit-bound blade_ spell."
