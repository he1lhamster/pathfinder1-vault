  ### Radium Weapons
  Barsoomian ﬁrearms are stocked with rare local woods.

Radium weapons ﬁre special cartridges that must be manufactured under artiﬁcial light, as exposure to sunlight results in an explosion. When the cartridges strike their target they shatter exposingthe radium powder within. The moment sunlight strikes this substance it explodes with considerable violence, making the weapons versatile for either direct ﬁre or suppressive ﬁre. Radium weapons follow the general rules for advanced firearms found in _Pathﬁnder Roleplaﬁng Game: Ultimate Combat_.
  All radium weapons use radium cartridges for ammunition. As a result. in addition to targeting speciﬁc creatures or objects. the wielder may ﬁre a radium weapon at an unoccupied square similar to throwing a splash weapon (_Pathfinder Core Rulebook 202_). All creatures within 15 feet of the targeted square take 2d6 points of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage (Reﬂex DC 15 half). Radium cartridge damage does not change based on the size of the weapon used to ﬁre them. Radium cartridges cannot be ﬁred effectively in this way outside the rays of the sun, such as underground or at night. Radium cartridges cost 3 gp per cartridge."
