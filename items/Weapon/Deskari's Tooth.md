Description: |
  "A gift to Areelu from Deskari himself, _Deskari's Tooth_ is a _+6 anarchic unholy dagger_ that automatically casts _soul bind_ whenever it is used to slay a foe, provided no soul is currently stored in the blade. A soul of any power can be stored in the blade in this manner, but only one soul at a time. If the dagger's wielder is slain while a soul is contained in _Deskari's Tooth_, the soul is instantly consumed and the effect or attack that would normally have slain the wielder is instead negated. If _Deskari's Tooth_ is used to perform a coup de grace on a lawful good creature, it can be used to cast _lesser planar binding_. If the lawful good creature has more than 11 Hit Dice, the dagger can instead be used to cast _planar binding_, and if the creature has more than 17 Hit Dice, it can instead be used to cast _greater planar binding_."
Destruction: |
  "_Deskari's Tooth_ must be used by a paladin to commit suicide, so that the paladin's soul becomes bound to the blade. If that soul is later used by a demon to prevent death, the dagger shatters upon preventing that death."
