Description: |
  "_Surcease of Sorrows_ is a _+4 adamantineimpact repositioning heavy mace_ that resembles a simple, key-shaped walking stick of bone. A gift from Asmodeus to the fledgling usher Barzahk—and subsequently purged of a devastating curse by Pharasma—the humble-seeming weapon is a beloved sign of the usher's station.
  _Surcease of Sorrows_ can function as a _chime of opening_ with unlimited charges. Three times per day, it can be used to dismiss any sort of magical barrier or wall. This functions as _greater dispel magic_, but affecting only abjuration spells and spells whose names contain "wall of," and it uses an attack roll with the weapon in place of a caster level check. If the spell to be broken is affecting a specific creature, the result of the attack roll to dispel it must equal or exceed the target spell DC or the creature's AC, whichever is higher."
Destruction: |
  "Asmodeus must crush the mace with his bare hands, but only if Barzahk is first slain."
