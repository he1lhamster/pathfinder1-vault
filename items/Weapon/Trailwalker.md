Description: |
  "This _+1 mithral bladed scarf_ (_Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide_ 290) is unusually long and ornate, patched and expanded over several generations into a garish collection of colors and stitching in the shapes of Varisian names and stylized map icons. Because of its extra length and magically enhanced balance and accuracy, when the wielder makes a full attack with _Trailwalker_, he can strike foes with it as if the item had the reach quality and still attack opponents adjacent to the wielder. This doesn't expand the wielder's reach for any attacks beyond those made as part of the full attack (such as attacks of opportunity).
  Once per day as a standard action, _Trailwalker's_ wielder can whirl the s carf through the air and teleport as though using _dimension door_. The wielder can't transport other creatures with this ability. If this ability is used to take the wielder from one spot on a road or trail to another spot on that or a connected road or trail (even if the connection is lengthy or indirect), this is a move action instead."
