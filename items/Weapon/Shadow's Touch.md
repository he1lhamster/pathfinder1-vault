Description: |
  "Amazingly light, this ebon _+2 keen dagger_ fades into near intangibility at its tip. It ignores bonuses to AC provided by deflection and force effects, and deals 2 points of Strength damage on a confirmed critical hit. By expending one use of mythic power while attacking, the wielder can strike a force effect and _disintegrate_ it as a touch attack. This effect also automatically dispels force effects that can be dispelled whether or not they're subject to _disintegrate_.
  As a standard action, the wielder can expend a use of mythic power while slashing at the air to open up a rift to the Shadow Plane. This functions as _shadow walk_, except that a maximum number of creatures equal to double the wielder's tier can pass through before the rift closes."
