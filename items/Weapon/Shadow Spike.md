Description: |
  "This _+2/+2 cruel quarterstaff_ is made of polished ebony, and features a blackened metal spike on its bottom end. As a standard action, the wielder can drive the spike into the ground on either the Material Plane or the Shadow Plane, creating a rift merging those two planes. This rift is 30 feet in diameter, lasts for 1 minute, and can be created once per day. If the creature that drives the _shadow spike_ into the ground expends one use of mythic power when doing so, the effect lasts until the _shadow spike_ is pulled out of the ground (which takes a standard action).
  The rift's area acts as the _deeper darkness_ spell. Spells with the darkness or shadow descriptors cast within the rift have +1 caster level, and are affected as if cast with the Extend Spell feat. As a standard action, any mythic creature within the area can expend three uses of mythic power to _plane shift_ to the Shadow Plane (if on the Material Plane) or to the Material Plane (if on the Shadow Plane). If a mythic creature _plane shifts_ while holding the _shadow spike_, the weapon teleports with that creature, ending the effect."
