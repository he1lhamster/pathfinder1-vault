Description: |
  "This intelligent item is called a _lightning bow_ by mortals, a name is seen as a slight to the lightning elemental trapped within it—a creature honor-bound to serve in the bow for no less than 100 years. Each of these _+3 adaptive composite longbows_ is a haughty and often highly intelligent member of its race, who chides those who don't know its true name— which is often a complicated series of high pitched squeaks, like live wood burning on a pyre. The elemental in a _lightning bow_ only speaks Auran. _Lightning bows_ will not fire on other outsiders with the elemental subtype. Some are also bound not to attack other individuals, based on their history. For instance, one of these bows might be foresworn not to attack the Sultan of Fire, fire giants, or red dragons. Additionally, _lightning bows_ have the following powers."

### Description

This intelligent item is _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ a _[[items/Weapon/Lightning Bow|lightning bow]]_ by mortals, a name is seen as a slight to the lightning elemental trapped within it—a creature honor-bound to serve in the bow for no less than 100 years. Each of these +3 adaptive composite longbows is a haughty and often highly intelligent member of its race, who chides those who don't know its _[[feats/True Name|true name]]_— which is often a complicated series of high pitched squeaks, like live wood _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Burning|burning]]_ on a pyre. The elemental in a _lightning bow_ only speaks Auran. Lightning bows will not fire on other outsiders with the elemental subtype. Some are also bound not to attack other individuals, based on their history. For instance, one of these bows might be foresworn not to attack the Sultan of Fire, fire giants, or red dragons. Additionally, lightning bows have the following powers.

* A _lightning bow_ needs no ammunition. With the _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ of a string, it creates a +3 _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Shock|shock]]_ arrow or a +3 _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Brilliant Energy|brilliant energy]]_ arrow (the wielder's choice with each shot).
* Three times per day, the wielder can cast _[[spells/True Strike|true strike]]_ as a swift action. The _true strike_ can only be used with attacks made with the _lightning bow_.
* Three times per day, the wielder can use _[[spells/Lightning Bolt|lightning bolt]]_ as a spell-like ability.
