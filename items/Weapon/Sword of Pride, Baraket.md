Description: |
  "Although known as the _Sword of Pride, Baraket_ appears to be nothing more than an elegant basket hilt made of glass or highly polished crystal with no blade, as the deadly length of this _+5 spell storing speed rapier_ is invisible. _Baraket_ grants its wielder a +5 bonus on Bluff checks made to feint, so long as his opponent cannot see invisible items. Additionally, on a critical hit, the sword casts _weird_ upon the target and all of that creature's allies within 30 feet.
  The _Swords of Sin_ were crafted to serve the runelords of Thassilon. In modern times, however, these runelords lie dead or dormant. With no lords to serve, the weapons of their champions lie dormant as well, reducing each to a _+2 weapon_ that retains any special abilities detailed on page 469 of the _Core Rulebook_, but no other properties. The only way to awaken one of the blades is to restore its runelord master to active life or have some other legitimate ruler take up its master's mantle (the weapon determines what is considered legitimate). The swords can detect such restorations and flare to full power immediately, demanding their wielder seek out the restored runelord and swear eternal fealty.
  _Baraket_ woke for a few brief moments along with its master, then returned to dormancy as Xanderghul was murdered. Although Xanderghul was immediately reborn in a specially prepared _simulacrum_ in the Temple of the Peacock Spirit, much of his power and presence was diminished by the trauma of death and rebirth. As a result, though Xanderghul is now technically active, _Baraket_ remains dormant. Its link to Xanderghul exists, but only in a form akin to a hazy, partially remembered dream. If a character handles _Baraket_, the sword functions as dormant, but the character nonetheless has a distinct feeling of being watched from afar. In this adventure, handling the _Sword of Sin_ without using the _runewarded gauntlets_ should be unsettling but relatively safe. This does not remain the case in the next adventure, as Xanderghul's influence over the sword slowly grows."
Destruction: |
  "Each of the _Swords of Sin_ can be destroyed merely by being commanded to break. That command, however, must come from the rightful runelord of the nation and school of magic associated with the blade."

### Description

Although known as the _[[items/Weapon/Sword of Pride, Baraket|Sword of Pride, Baraket]]_ appears to be nothing more than an elegant _[[items/Mundane/Basket|basket]]_ hilt made of glass or highly polished crystal with no blade, as the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ length of this +5 _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Spell Storing|spell storing]]_ speed _[[items/Weapon/Rapier|rapier]]_ is _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_. Baraket grants its wielder a +5 bonus on Bluff checks made to feint, so long as his opponent cannot see _invisible_ items. Additionally, on a critical hit, the sword casts _[[spells/Weird|weird]]_ upon the target and all of that creature's allies within 30 feet.
