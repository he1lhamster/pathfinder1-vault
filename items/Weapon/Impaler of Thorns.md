  "The _impaler of thorns_ is an ancient weapon dating back to Thassilonian times, when it was often used by city guards to aid in breaking up civil unrest. An _impaler's_ shaft is made of darkwood, and its head is a thornlike, wide-bladed barb. When an _impaler of thorns_ is used in combat, its successful critical hits are accompanied by an unsettling screech, as of some wild beast in anger.
  An _impaler of thorns_ is a _+1 longspear_. Once per day as it strikes a foe, the wielder can cause it (as a free action) to unleash a 30-footradius burst of despair that affects all creatures not wielding an _impaler of thorns_. Creatures affected must succeed at DC 16 Will saves or become overwhelmed with sadness and despair, taking –2 penalties on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls for 6 minutes. The target struck when this effect is triggered must also succeed at a second DC 16 Will save to resist becoming nauseated with despair for 1 round."
