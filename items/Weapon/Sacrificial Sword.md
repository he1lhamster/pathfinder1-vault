  "This finely crafted _+2 bastard sword_ has three blood-red gems embedded in its pommel. When the wielder kills a living creature (even herself) with the _sacrificial sword_, she can transfer the life force of that creature into the body of a dead or dying ally up to 50 feet away as a swift action. The transferred life force acts as a _reach_ _breath of life_ spell. Each time this ability is activated, all color drains from one of the embedded gems. When all three gems are clear, the _sacrificial sword_ can no longer transfer life energy, but it can still be used as a _+2 bastard sword_."
