Description: |
  "While in the hands of a non-mythic creature, a _witherfang_ functions as a _+3 kukri_. However, over time it begins to consume the life essence of its wielder. If the wielder is nonmythic, each week he must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution drain that can't be healed until 1 week after he stops wielding the weapon. The _witherfang_ then converts the stolen life essence into mythic power. A _witherfang_ can hold a maximum of 20 uses of mythic power.
  A mythic character can use a _witherfang's_ stolen mythic power to activate her own mythic abilities or to enhance the blade with the following abilities: _bane_, _dancing_, _speed_, and _wounding_. Each ability lasts for 24 hours, and only one can be applied to the blade within each 24-hour period. The wielder can increase the _witherfang's_ enhancement bonus by 1 for each use of mythic power she expends. Alternately, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to imbue the blade with the _bane_ special ability, two uses to imbue it with the _wounding_ special ability, three uses to imbue it with the _speed_ special ability, or four uses to imbue it with the _dancing_ special ability."
