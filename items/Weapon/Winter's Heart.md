Description: |
  "Carved long ago from the ice at the heart of an ancient glacier and infused with a cold and unstoppable drive, this _+5 icy burst quenching bastard sword_ (_Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment_ 146) changes size to match its wielder. Spell-like abilities used by _Winter's Heart_ receive the benefits of Greater Spell Focus (evocation).
  As a standard action, the wielder of _Winter's Heart_ can dispel fire effects as a _frost brand_. Alternatively, as a standard action, the wielder can quench a Huge or smaller nonmagical fire by touching it with the sword.
  The sword commands the following spell-like abilities:
  3/day— _heroism_ (on its wielder only)
  1/day—empowered _cone of cold_ (DC 21), maximized widened _detonate_ (cold only, DC 20), _word of recall_
  The DC for _detonate_ is determined as if it were an 8th-level spell. If _detonate_ is cast on a creature with the cold subtype, it also acts as _heal_; if cast on a creature with the fire subtype, it also acts as _harm_.
  _Winter's Heart_ has the special purpose of uniting the lands of the north under one iron rule. When pursuing this purpose, it surrounds its wielder in icy armor that combines the protection of _stoneskin_ and _fire shield_ (cold flames). If the protection of the _stoneskin_ is exhausted, both protections are lost and the sword can't reestablish them for 10 minutes."
Destruction: |
  "_Winter's Heart_ can be destroyed only if it's hurled into the center of a cataclysmic volcanic eruption. Even a normal volcano's heat is insufficient to melt the blade, and Immersing it in magma merely solidifies the magma into rock."
