Description: |
  "This _+1 light repeating crossbow_ of deep mahogany rimmed with gold has a stock carved in the likeness of Abadar's First Vault. An extradimensional space within the crossbow can hold 20 bolts. Loading new bolts into the extradimensional space requires a move action that provokes an attack of opportunity for each bolt. The crossbow weighs the same no matter how many bolts are placed inside it. A worshiper of Abadar treats the _vaultbow_ as a light crossbow for purposes of proficiency and applying the benefits of feats relating to a light crossbow.
  Three times per day, the wielder can choose to have a bolt transform into a length of chain that wraps around its target on a successful attack. This decision must be made before the attack roll is made. A Large or smaller creature struck by this attack becomes entangled (and if dependent on wings to fly, it must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or lose the ability to fly while entangled). An entangled creature can break (and destroy) the chains with a successful DC 30 Strength check or escape them with a successful DC 30 combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check. This chain lasts for 5 rounds before fading from existence."
