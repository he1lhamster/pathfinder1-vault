Description: |
  "The head of this _+1 heavy flail_ looks like a human skull with wicked spikes growing out of it. At will, the wielder can affect a creature struck by the _obliviating flail_ with _lesser confusion_ as a free action (a successful DC 11 Will saving throw negates this effect). If the struck opponent fails its save against the _lesser confusion_ effect, the wielder of the _obliviating flail_ is automatically affected by this effect as well (no saving throw). If the wielder uses the flail to perform a coup de grace and successfully kills her target, she gains 1d4 temporary hit points, which last for 1 minute per HD of the target slain."
