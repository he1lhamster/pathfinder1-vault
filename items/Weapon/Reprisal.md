Description: |
  "_Reprisal_ is an unusually well-balanced and responsive _+2 rapier_. _Reprisal_ 's wielder can apply her Dexterity modifier to damage rolls with the weapon in place of her Strength modifier—this bonus is not increased if _Reprisal_ is wielded two-handed, but is halved if the rapier is wielded in an off-hand. If _Reprisal_ confirms a critical hit against an evil outsider, the rapier gains the _evil-outsider-bane_ special ability and is treated as silver, cold iron, and good for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction for the next minute. Subsequent critical hits extend this duration by 1 minute per blow. As long as this effect persists, _Reprisal_ 's wielder gains a +2 sacred bonus on all saving throws against attacks from evil outsiders. These effects end prematurely if _Reprisal_ is sheathed, disarmed, or is otherwise no longer wielded."
Destruction: |
  "If _Reprisal_ is used to knowingly and deliberately murder a true worshiper of Cayden Cailean, the rapier may thereafter be destroyed normally, as if it were not an artifact."
