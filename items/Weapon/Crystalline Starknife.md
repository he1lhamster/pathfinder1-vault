Description: |
  "The original _crystalline starknife_ was the weapon of Nugloss, a powerful priestess of Desna who fought for the Linnorm Kings during the Winter War. Made of a crystal-like substance similar in appearance to ice but as hard as steel, a _crystalline starknife_ is a _+2 starknife_ that deals +1d6 points of damage against crystalline creatures, as the weapon's edges are particularly adept at shattering and weakening such foes. When thrown in conditions of bright or normal light, a _crystalline starknife_ catches the light and creates a whirling disk of prismatic color. A creature hit by a _crystalline starknife_ thrown in such conditions becomes dazzled for 1 round—or dazed for 1 round on a critical hit. A successful DC 14 Will save negates the dazzled or dazed condition. When thrown by a worshiper of Desna, a _crystalline starknife_ gains the _returning_ weapon special ability."
