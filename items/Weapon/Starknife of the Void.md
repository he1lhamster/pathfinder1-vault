Description: |
  "The _starknife of the void_ is a weapon designed by devotees of Black Butterfly and at one time could only be found among the faithful of her mystery cults. Over time, these weapons fell into the hands of those outside the cult, and now they crop up in odd places— sealed vaults, underground treasure caches, the bottom of the sea—but always places where there is darkness and stillness.
  The _starknife of the void_ is a _+2 returning starknife_. If the wielder scores a critical hit against a foe with a _starknife of the void_, it discharges a _blindness/deafness_ spell affecting the creature struck. The target must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or be struck blind or deaf (as chosen by the wielder of the _starknife of the void_). If the _starknife of the void_ deals more than one critical hit to the same target, the target can potentially become both blind and deaf."
