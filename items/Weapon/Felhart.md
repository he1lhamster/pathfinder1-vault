Description: |
  "_Felhart_ is a _+2 bane longbow_ crafted from the fiercely carved horns of at least two venerable stags and strung with a cord laced with silver. The designated foe that its bane effect functions against varies, being determined by the creature a wielder hates the most when the bow is first picked up (as decided upon by the GM). This bane effect remains the same for a wielder, regardless of how many times he's used the bow. Thus, for one user it might be a _+2 bane vs. humanoids (humans) longbow_, while for another it might be a _+2 bane vs. dragons longbow_. A wielder can do nothing to change the bow's bane effect.
  In addition, once per week, _felhart's_ wielder can summon a reliable steed as per the spell _mount_. This creature takes the form of a lean, swift white elk that, despite its almost ghostly appearance, possesses the same statistics as a horse. This creature allows _felhart's_ wielder to ride it, and serves loyally for up to 5 hours, vanishing at the end of this time. The mount will not allow any creature beside _felhart's_ wielder to ride it unless the weapon's bearer succeeds at a DC 16 Handle Animal check. Even if this check succeeds, the mount only allows another rider to ride along with the weapon bearer. The elk never allows a strange rider to ride it alone."
