Description: |
  "Favored by worshipers of Desna and elves alike, the silvery wooden limbs and green riser of this _+3 composite longbow_ are decorated with rows of tiny stars, sparkling comets, and little moons. Arrows fired from this bow trail streams of silvery light, and resemble shooting stars as they fly. Creatures that take penalties in bright light take these penalties for 1 round after being struck by such an arrow. An arrow shot from the _starbow_ sheds light as a sunrod for 1 minute after it is shot. A _starbow_ responds to the strength of its wielder, acting as a bow with a strength rating equal to its wielder's Strength bonus. The wielder can fire it with a lesser Strength bonus (and cause less damage) if desired. Three times per day as a standard action, the wielder can use a starbow to fire a 30-foot-long cone of arrow-shaped bolts of radiance. All creatures in the area of effect take 5d8 points of damage unless they are undead or creatures harmed by sunlight, in which case the damage increases to 10d8. This damage bypasses damage reduction and energy resistance. A successful DC 18 Reflex save halves the damage. A creature that takes damage from this attack is shrouded with a soft radiance (as _faerie fire_) for 1 minute."

### Description

Favored by worshipers of Desna and elves alike, the silvery wooden limbs and green riser of this +3 _[[items/Weapon/Composite longbow|composite longbow]]_ are decorated with rows of tiny stars, sparkling comets, and little moons. Arrows fired from this bow trail streams of silvery light, and resemble shooting stars as they fly. Creatures that take penalties in bright light take these penalties for 1 round after being struck by such an arrow. An arrow shot from the _[[items/Weapon/Starbow|starbow]]_ sheds light as a _[[items/Mundane/Sunrod|sunrod]]_ for 1 minute after it is shot. A _starbow_ responds to the strength of its wielder, acting as a bow with a strength rating equal to its wielder's Strength bonus. The wielder can fire it with a lesser Strength bonus (and cause less damage) if desired. Three times per day as a standard action, the wielder can use a _starbow_ to fire a 30-foot-long cone of arrow-shaped bolts of _[[items/Weapon/Radiance|radiance]]_. All creatures in the area of effect take 5d8 points of damage unless they are undead or creatures harmed by sunlight, in which case the damage increases to 10d8. This damage bypasses _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_ and _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Energy Resistance|energy resistance]]_. A successful DC 18 Reflex save halves the damage. A creature that takes damage from this attack is shrouded with a soft _radiance_ (as _[[spells/Faerie Fire|faerie fire]]_) for 1 minute.
