Description: |
  "This bloodstained spiked chain has a large handle-ring that glows a pale violet color when wielded in normal light. An _umbral chain_ grows more potent in darkness. It acts as a _+1 spiked chain_ when in dim light. In darkness, it acts as a _+2 spiked chain_. When surrounded by supernatural darkness (such as in an area of _deeper darkness_), it acts as a _+2 spiked chain_ and grants the wielder the Blind-Fight feat. In daylight or bright illumination, the weapon temporarily loses all its magical enhancement bonuses and is effectively a masterwork weapon, though it resumes its magical functions once it's no longer in bright light. The violet glow from the weapon dims in response to ambient light, vanishing completely in darkness or supernatural darkness."
