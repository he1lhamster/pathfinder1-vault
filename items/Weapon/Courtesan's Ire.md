Description: |
  "Elegant as it is deadly, this _+1 fighting fan_ is under a minor glamer that causes it to resemble a nonlethal fan intended for courtly or social affairs, though the glamer lacks the full protections of the _glamered_ weapon quality. Dozens of sharp barbs adorn the top of the fan, typically hidden by the glamer effect. Up to three times per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause these blades to shoot forth, dealing 3d4 points of piercing damage to all creatures in a 15- foot cone (Reflex DC 14 half).
  As with all fighting fans, the tips of the weapon can be poisoned. Applied injury poison affects all creatures that take damage from the fan's hail of blades, though the save DCs for such poison are reduced by 2 due to the low dosage."
