Description: |
  "This _+1 featherweight dart_ is designed to be fired from a small wrist launcher. As with a normal featherweight dart, it deals no damage; it instead administers 1 dose of an applied poison as long as the target doesn't have damage reduction, hardness, or the like. Once the dart has been launched, whether it hits or misses, the creature that fired it can use a swift action to recall the dart to a convenient location, such as the palm of a hand or a pocket, removing the dart from the scene of the attack. The magical recovery of the dart does not prevent it from being damaged, so as with other magical ammunition, it can't be reused."
