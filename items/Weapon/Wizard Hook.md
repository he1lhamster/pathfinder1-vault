Description: |
  "A _wizard hook_ is a _+1 hook hand_ (_Pirates of the Inner Sea_ 19) and a useful item for any arcane spellcaster. Although a _wizard hook_ does not allow for fine manipulation, it is infused with magic that bolsters somatic components—you can use a hand stump outfitted with a _wizard hook_ to fulfill any somatic components for casting arcane spells. A _wizard hook_ also grants proficiency in its use as a weapon. You can make touch attacks with spells using a _wizard hook_, either by making a normal attack with the hook (in which case it deals normal hook hand damage plus the spell effect), or by making a touch attack with the hook (in which case you gain a +4 bonus on the attack roll and the save DC of the spell increases by +1, but you do not do hook hand damage)."
