Description: |
  "This _+1 spiked gauntlet_ is shaped like a skull studded with metal spikes. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can strike the ground with the gauntlet, causing a 10-foot-square, 30-foot-deep extradimensional pit filled with spikes to open within 30 feet, as per _spiked pit_ (_Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide_ 246). The gauntlet's enhancement bonus is added to the piercing damage caused by the pit's spikes. If the wearer increases the gauntlet's enhancement bonus (such as with _greater magic weapon_ or a paladin's divine bond ability), the additional weapon enhancement bonus is also added to the damage. Similarly, if the gauntlet has any weapon special abilities that deal extra damage (such as _flaming_ or _wounding_), this extra damage is likewise added to the damage caused by the pit's spikes. Weapon special abilities that don't deal extra damage, or that deal damage to the wielder as well (such as _vicious_) do not affect the pit's spikes."
