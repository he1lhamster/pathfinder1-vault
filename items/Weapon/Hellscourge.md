  "This _+1 unholy scorpion whip_ (_Ultimate Combat_ 144) is fashioned from skin flayed from a barbed devil's back. It grants its wielder a +5 competence bonus on Intimidate checks. A shaken creature struck by the _hellscourge_ must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or become frightened for 1 round. A frightened or panicked creature struck must instead save or cower for 1d4 rounds. Both of these are mind-affecting fear effects.
  If wielded by a person who wears _hamatula hide armor_, the _hellscourge_ functions as a _+1 flaming unholy whip_. Such a wielder can lash the whip once per day to hurl flames as a _scorching ray_ (creating two rays); doing so extinguishes the whip's flames until the next day."
