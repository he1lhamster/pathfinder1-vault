Description: |
  "This scarred piece of crimson stained metal functions similarly to a _+5 returning throwing greatsword_. Instead of the normal benefit of the _throwing_ weapon special ability, _Garvok_ can be thrown with a 25-foot range increment. Additionally, whenever _Garvok_ strikes a foe, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or take an additional 5d6 points of fire damage. If the sword scores a critical hit, it explodes in a _fireball_ centered on the wielder's opponent. All creatures within the _fireball's_ 20-foot-radius spread—including _Garvok's_ wielder and allies, if within range—take 10d6 points of fire damage (DC 25 Reflex for half). The wielder has no control over the sword's eruption and cannot prevent it from exploding. The sword returns to its wielder's hand, fully reformed, just before the beginning of his next turn.
  **Dormancy** The _Alara'hai_ were crafted to serve the runelords of Thassilon. In modern times, however, these runelords lie dead or dormant. With no lords to serve, the weapons of their champions lie dormant as well, reducing each to a +2 weapon with the noted weapon special abilities (those detailed on page 469 of the _Core Rulebook_) but no other properties. The only way to awaken one of the blades is to restore its runelord master to active life or have some other legitimate ruler take up its master's mantle (the weapon determines what is considered legitimate). The swords can detect such restorations and f lare to full power immediately, demanding their wielder seek out the restored runelord and swear eternal fealty."
Destruction: |
  "Each of the _Seven Swords of Sin_ can be destroyed merely if commanded to break. That command, however, must come from the rightful runelord of the nation and school of magic associated with the blade."

This scarred piece of crimson stained metal functions similarly to a +5 returning _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Throwing|throwing]]_ _[[items/Weapon/Greatsword|greatsword]]_. Instead of the normal benefit of the _throwing_ weapon special ability, Garvok can be thrown with a 25-foot range increment. Additionally, whenever Garvok strikes a foe, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or take an additional 5d6 points of fire damage. If the sword scores a critical hit, it explodes in a _[[spells/Fireball|fireball]]_ centered on the wielder's opponent.
