Description: |
  "Forged with a wicked barbed end that resembles a key, this _+2 redeemed longsword_ was once the unholy sword of a diabolist—before a party of adventurers retrieved it from his corpse and repurposed the weapon for good. The _devil's key_ is designed to permanently slay evil outsiders by bringing the fight to their plane of origin so they can be killed outright. Once per day as a swift action after a successful attack against an evil outsider, the wielder can activate the sword to _plane shift_ the wielder and the target of the attack to the creature's home plane. The targeted outsider can resist this effect with a successful DC 20 Will save. Once the target of this ability is slain by the wielder, the sword activates another _plane shift_ as an immediate action that brings the wielder back to the exact spot it previously left."
