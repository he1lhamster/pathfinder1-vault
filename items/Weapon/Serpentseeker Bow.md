If such a creature is hit by an arrow fired from this weapon, anyone who touches the bow senses the location of that creature as though by _locate creature_ as long as the arrow remains imbedded in the creature. If the creature is protected by _nondetection_ or a similar effect, anyone holding the bow gains a +10 competence bonus on the caster level check to overcome it, but a failed check means the arrow's magic burns out.
