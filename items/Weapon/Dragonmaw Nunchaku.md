Description: |
  "The bars of this _+2 nunchaku_ are solid iron, wrapped in leather decorated with an imperial dragon motif, and connected by a chain. Once per day, when the wielder of a _dragonmaw nunchaku_ confirms a critical hit against an opponent with the nunchaku, he can cast _confusion_ on that creature as a free action. The confusion effect lasts for 8 rounds, and a DC 16 Will save negates the effect.
  In addition, in the round following a successful disarm attack with the _dragonmaw nunchaku_, the wielder can spin the nunchaku as a standard action, creating a curtain of whirling force replicas of the disarmed weapon around himself for 1 round. This functions as a ringed _blade barrier_ with a radius of 10 feet around the wielder (Reflex DC 19). The disarmed weapon determines the damage dice of the _blade barrier_ (i.e., 12d6 for a wakizashi, 12d8 for a katana, and so on). The disarmed weapon is unaffected, and drops to the ground as normal. The wielder can create the _blade barrier_ once per day, and only in the round following a successful disarm attack."
