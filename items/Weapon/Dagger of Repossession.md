Description: |
  "This _+1 dagger_ has a thin crystal tube embedded in its center. Once per day, the wielder of this dagger may slash herself, dealing damage as normal, but also channel some of her own blood into the tube, imprinting her memories onto the dagger.
  The imprinted blood lasts for a number of days equal to the wielder's HD plus her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). During this time, the _dagger of repossession_ is typically given to an ally of the creature whose blood is imprinted. If the original wielder becomes possessed (such as by a ghost's malevolence ability or a _magic jar_ spell) and she's slashed with the dagger again, the imprinted blood is consumed, the target regains her memories, and any possession effect immediately ends. A _dagger of repossession_ does not end charm or compulsion effects, but the target receives another save against these effects at the original DC. Other mind-affecting effects are unaffected by the dagger. An imprinted _dagger of repossession_ has no unusual effect if used on anyone other than the target whose blood is imprinted."
