Description: |
  "Alaznist's Hateful Ranseur is a _+3 keen spell-storing wounding adamantine ranseur_ that bears a charred human skull—a representation of Runelord Alderpash's—impaled upon its blade, though this does not impede its use as a weapon. The ranseur grants the wielder a +2 luck bonus on attacks, saves, and ability and skill checks. On a critical hit, _Alaznist's Hateful Ranseur_ deals 1d4 points of damage to the target's Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom—whichever score is the highest. The weapon tirelessly threatens destruction and vengeance upon any wielder who is not a rightful ruler of Bakrakhan, given its purpose of defeating all others than its wielder. The ranseur can cast _cure serious wounds_ and _protection from energy_ on its wielder each three times per day, and it can cast _lightning bolt_ three times per day."
Destruction: |
  "_Alaznist's Hateful Ranseur_ can be destroyed if it is hurled under the crushing feet of the Oliphaunt of Jandelay, but only if there is no current Runelord of Wrath living in the world."
