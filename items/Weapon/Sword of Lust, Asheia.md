Description: |
  "This beautiful blade is a _+5 flaming longsword_. While bearing the weapon, the wielder is immune to all enchantment effects. Any creature that casts an enchantment spell upon _Asheia's_ wielder is led to believe its spell or effect worked as normal and that the sword's bearer is under its control, allowing the wielder to deceive his opponent if he so chooses (and doesn't give his enemy a reason to believe its magic failed). Whenever _Asheia_ strikes an opponent, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or fall under the effects of a _charm monster_ spell. Only one creature can be charmed in this way at a time. If another creature becomes charmed by the sword, the first is freed from this effect. If the sword instead scores a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be affected by a _dominate monster_ spell.
  **Dormancy** The _Alara'hai_ were crafted to serve the runelords of Thassilon. In modern times, however, these runelords lie dead or dormant. With no lords to serve, the weapons of their champions lie dormant as well, reducing each to a +2 weapon with the noted weapon special abilities (those detailed on page 469 of the _Core Rulebook_) but no other properties. The only way to awaken one of the blades is to restore its runelord master to active life or have some other legitimate ruler take up its master's mantle (the weapon determines what is considered legitimate). The swords can detect such restorations and f lare to full power immediately, demanding their wielder seek out the restored runelord and swear eternal fealty."
Destruction: |
  "Each of the _Seven Swords of Sin_ can be destroyed merely if commanded to break. That command, however, must come from the rightful runelord of the nation and school of magic associated with the blade."
