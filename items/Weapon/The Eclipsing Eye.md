Description: |
  "_The Eclipsing Eye_ is a _+4 adamantineaxiomatic unholy wounding heavy mace_; it is a token of esteem and power granted by Asmodeus himself to the governor of Hell's greatest city. It allows the wielder to command allegiance as per a _rod of rulership_ with an unlimited duration when activated in Hell. Outside of Hell, it remains limited to 500 total minutes of this effect, but does not crumble to dust if these minutes are used up. Every hour it spends in Hell restores 1 minute of expended duration. When used as a weapon, _The Eclipsing Eye_ has a critical multiplier of ×3. _The Eclipsing Eye_ automatically casts blindness (as per _blindness/deafness_ heightened to 9th level, save DC 23) on the first creature it strikes each round. _The Eclipsing Eye_ is Dispater's rod of office, and he can summon it to his hand as a free action from any distance, even across planar boundaries. As long as he wields it, all lawful evil, neutral evil, and lawful neutral creatures treat him as if he were under a _sanctuary_ spell (CL 30th, save DC 23 as if heightened to a 9th level spell). Three times per day, _The Eclipsing Eye_ can create any of the following spell effects, heightened to 9th level as per the Heighten Spell feat: _calm emotions_, _demand_, _discern lies_, and _discern location_."
Destruction: |
  "Asmodeus can will the destruction of _The Eclipsing Eye_ as a free action, but otherwise it can be destroyed only by immersing it in the headwaters of the River Styx for a century, allowing the artifact to rust away."
