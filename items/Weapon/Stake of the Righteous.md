Description: |
  "Cooled in baths of holy water after its forging, this _+1 silver stake_ (see the _Advanced Player's Guide_) is often used by devout warriors to slay vampires. When driven through a helpless vampire's heart, the stake emits a constant _hallow_ effect centered on the slain vampire (whoever placed the stake can choose to fix a spell effect to the stake as a full-round action; otherwise follow the rules in the _hallow_ spell description in the _Core Rulebook_).
  Once a _stake of the righteous_ has been driven into a vampire's heart, only creatures that share the original slayer's alignment can easily remove it. Other creatures may attempt to remove the stake by making a DC 14 Charisma check; a creature that fails this check takes 2d6 points of damage as holy energy courses through the weapon, and it cannot attempt to remove the stake again for 24 hours."

### Description

Cooled in baths of _[[items/Mundane/Holy water|holy water]]_ after its forging, this +1 silver stake (see the Advanced Player's Guide) is often used by devout warriors to slay vampires. When driven through a _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ _[[monsters/Vampire|vampire]]_'s heart, the stake emits a constant _[[spells/Hallow|hallow]]_ effect centered on the slain _vampire_ (whoever placed the stake can choose to fix a spell effect to the stake as a full-round action; otherwise follow the rules in the _hallow_ spell description in the Core Rulebook).

Once a _[[items/Weapon/Stake of the Righteous|stake of the righteous]]_ has been driven into a _vampire_'s heart, only creatures that share the original _[[classes/Slayer|slayer]]_'s alignment can easily remove it.
