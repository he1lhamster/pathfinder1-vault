Description: |
  "A wielder with a free hand can split this _+1 dagger_ into two identical _+1 daggers_ as a swift action, or a free action if she has the Quick Draw feat. The doubled daggers can't be split again. If either dagger is thrown while doubled, the hurled dagger vanishes after resolving the attack and the remaining dagger can be split again. If the wielder drops a doubled dagger or it otherwise leaves her person, it vanishes. If both daggers leave the wielder's hands at the same time, determine randomly which dagger vanishes.
  Spells or effects placed on a _dagger of doubling_ don't duplicate when the dagger is split. Any active effects on a dagger end when it vanishes. Destroying one of the doubled daggers just causes the duplicate to disappear, but any damage to a single _dagger of doubling_ remains on both daggers when it doubles."
