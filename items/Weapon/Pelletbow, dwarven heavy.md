Description: |
  "The dwarven pelletbow is a crossbowlike weapon that is loaded with and fires sling bullets rather than bolts. A dwarven heavy pelletbow takes the same amount of time and effort to load as a light crossbow (normally a move action), and a dwarven light pelletbow can be reloaded as a free action (allowing characters to attack with it multiple times in a round). Normally a pelletbow takes two hands to operate, but you can shoot (but not load) a pelletbow with one hand by taking a –2 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot one pelletbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls for attacking with two weapons (treating the heavy pelletbow as a one-handed weapon and the light pelletbow as a light weapon).
  Feats and special abilities that don't involve proficiency (that don't depend on dealing piercing damage or firing bolts) that apply to a heavy crossbow also apply to a dwarven heavy pelletbow, and those that apply to a light crossbow also apply to a dwarven light pelletbow."
