  "This adamantine _light mace_ has been molded to resemble the fist of a golem. When the mace is touched or picked up by a creature, elemental energies within the mace surge and swirl around the user's hands, but the energies soon subside as the gauntlets become adjusted to the user. When the user deals damage to a golem with the _golem gauntlet_, the golem must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or lose its spell immunity until the beginning of the wearer's next turn. In addition, the user can use the _golem gauntlet_ to ready an action to counter a ranged attack generated by a spell effect that targets the wielder. If the readied action is triggered, the wielder of the gauntlet can make a melee attack roll against the ranged attack. If the result of the wielder's attack roll is greater than the attack roll of the magical ranged attack, the magical ranged attack is negated."
