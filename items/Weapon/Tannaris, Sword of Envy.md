This ability has no special effect on summoned creatures or persistent spell effects. If the attack is a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 25 Will saving throw or have all of the spells currently affecting it dispelled (as per the spell _greater dispel magic_; no additional dispel checks are required)."
