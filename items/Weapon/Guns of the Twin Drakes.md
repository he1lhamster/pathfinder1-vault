Description: |
  "These paired firearms—a _+1 flaming dragon pistol_ and a _+1 frost dragon pistol_—are ornately inscribed and carefully carved to resemble fire and ice drakes as a tribute to an infamous pair of quarreling drake siblings (though the names of the drakes have been lost to time).
  As a swift action, the _guns of the twin drakes_ can be joined together to function as a double-barreled weapon. As a standard action, the joined weapons can be fired at the same time; in this case they must be fired at the same target, and each shot uses a separate attack roll and takes a –4 penalty. When fired this way, the first shot deals 1d4 additional points of fire damage and the second deals 1d4 additional points of cold damage; this damage is instead of the extra damage normally granted by the _flaming_ and _frost_ weapon special abilities."
