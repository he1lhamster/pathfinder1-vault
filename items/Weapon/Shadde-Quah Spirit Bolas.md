  "Primarily used by the cliff-dwelling Shoanti of western Varisia's Shadde-Quah clan, a _+1 Shoanti bolas_ is elementally enchanted. Each end of a bolas has its own magical enhancements: one side bears cold magic, and the other bears fire magic. A target damaged by a _Shadde-Quah spirit bolas_ takes an additional 1d3 points of cold damage and 1d3 points of fire damage, as the two weights damage their target as though the weapon had both the _flaming_ and _frost_ special weapon abilities at half their normal effectiveness.
  Once per day as a standard action, the wielder of a _Shadde-Quah spirit bolas_ can utter a prayer to the elements and throw the bolas, causing both ends to crash together mid-flight. The bolas transforms into a roiling ball of water, as the spell _aqueous orb_ (_Advanced Player's Guide_ 202), under the control of the thrower. Once the spell ends, the bolas falls to the ground at the same location the orb ended its movement."
