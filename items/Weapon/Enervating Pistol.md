Description: |
  "Kerdak Bonefist had this _+1 reliable distance pistol_ (_Ultimate Combat_ 138, 142) specially crafted for him to take advantage of his unique skeletal hand. The pistol shows signs of wear and exposure to the elements, but its walnut stock, nickelplated barrel, and gold accents are of fine craftsmanship, and its mechanisms still move with precision. Ammunition fired from an _enervating pistol_ deals an extra 1d6 points of negative energy damage on a successful hit. On a successful critical hit, an _enervating pistol_ bestows a negative level on its target. One day after being struck, subjects must make a DC 16 Fortitude save for each negative level or they become permanent. An _enervating pistol_ bestows one permanent negative level on any creature wielding it that is not undead or does not possess an undead hand. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the weapon is wielded."
