Description: |
  "Instead of a blade, a swathe of absolute darkness inimical to life tips this scythe. It functions as a _+1 brilliant energy scythe_, except the blade is formed of negative energy and gives off no light whatsoever. The wielder can channel negative energy directly into the scythe to charge it with life-destroying energy for 1 round per die of channeling. For example, channeling negative energy for 5d6 points of damage fuels the scythe for 5 rounds. While so charged, the _void scythe_ bestows one negative level with each hit. One day after being struck, subjects must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save for each negative level or the negative levels become permanent.
  Black energy utterly consumes any creature that is slain by the _void scythe_, leaving no body behind but leaving the creature's equipment unharmed. A victim of the _void scythe_ can be restored only by _true resurrection_ or carefully worded _miracle_ or _wish_."
