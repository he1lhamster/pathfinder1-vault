Description: |
  "This oversized _+2 warhammer_ is forged from blue steel and engraved with Abyssal runes that read, "There are no screams for those who die the frozen death." A _frost-thunder hammer_ is sized for giants; it is a two-handed weapon for Medium-sized creatures, who take a –2 penalty on attack rolls for wielding an oversized weapon.
  Once per day as a ranged touch attack, the wielder of a _frost-thunder hammer_ can slam the weapon against the ground to release a crackling bolt of ice that shoots across the ground toward a single target up to 100 feet away. On a successful hit, the ice immediately freezes around the target, trapping it within a 9-inch-thick solid block of pale blue ice. The ice blocks line of effect to the entrapped victim, who is helpless (but can still breathe) and takes 9 points of cold damage per round until freed. The ice has hardness 0 and 27 hit points; if the ice is broken, the creature is freed. A creature can break the ice as a full-round action with a successful DC 24 Strength check."
