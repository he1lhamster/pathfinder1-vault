Description: |
  "A broken chain link of tempered steel is embedded in the head of this _+1 warhammer_. If the wielder successfully uses the hammer to make an attack or perform a sunder combat maneuver against a nonmagical metal chain or an object made of nonmagical chain links (excluding weapons or armor), it deals an additional 2d6 points of damage. In addition, once per day as a standard action, the wielder can speak a command word to attempt to remove a compulsion spell or effect from a willing creature that is within 30 feet, as per _break enchantment_. The owner can use this ability as long as she has the _Andoren emancipation hammer_ on her person, even if she's not wielding it; however, when targeting an unwilling creature, the wielder must succeed at a touch attack, and may choose to forgo the damage that would usually be dealt. (If the wielder's attack misses, the hammer's magic is not expended.) The owner of the hammer can use this ability to remove a compulsion from herself, as long as the compulsion doesn't prevent it."
