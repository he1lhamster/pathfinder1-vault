Description: |
  "_Blackaxe_ is a Huge _+5 plant bane greataxe_ which is considered epic and can penetrate epic damage reduction. Virulent acid constantly seeps from its blade, dealing +1d6 points of acid damage on a successful hit. On a successful critical hit, _Blackaxe_ deals an additional +2d10 points of acid damage. Once per minute, the weapon's wielder can use _heal_ on herself by striking a living and nonmagical tree with _Blackaxe_, causing the tree to wither to ash. The artifact is inexorably tied to the nascent demon lord Treerazer, who can call _Blackaxe_ to his hand as a free action, despite any intervening distance, so long as _Blackaxe_ is not kept in an area that prevents teleportation effects from occurring. While _Blackaxe_ is wielded by another creature, Treerazer always knows that creature's location and condition (as via the _discern location_ and _status_ spells), and by concentrating can observe the world around the wielder as if using that wielder's senses. While in this state, Treerazer may use any of his spell-like abilities through the link, treating _Blackaxe_ as if it were the source of the spelllike ability. Each time Treerazer does so, _Blackaxe's_ wielder must make a successful DC 25 Will save to avoid being staggered for 1 round from the flow of power. These spelllike abilities trigger during the wielder's turn in initiative, but do not consume any of the wielder's actions in that round."
Destruction: |
  "In order to destroy _Blackaxe_, the weapon must be used against a powerful magical tree, and while the sap on the blade is still fresh it must then be used to sever one of the demon lord Cyth-V'sug's many fungoid limbs. Doing so causes _Blackaxe_ to explode in a burst of obsidian shrapnel and acid that deals 20d6 points of acid damage and 20d6 points of piercing damage to all within a 60-foot burst (DC 30 Reflex save for half)."
