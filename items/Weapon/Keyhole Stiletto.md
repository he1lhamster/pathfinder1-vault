Description: |
  "This sturdy _+1 ghost touch adamantine dagger_ can be used as a punch to destroy the workings of a lock or other mechanical device, granting a +2 bonus to Disable Device checks for that purpose, but leaving obvious signs of tampering. Its true usefulness becomes evident when wielded against force magic. The wielder of a _keyhole stiletto_ ignores armor bonuses granted by a force effect (such as the _mage armor_ spell or _bracers of armor_). Once per day, the user may whisper a command word to allow the stiletto to cut a single small hole in a force effect such as a _wall of force_ or _resilient sphere_. The hole can be any shape, but the blade cannot cut a line longer than 3 feet or carve a circle wider than 1 foot."
