Description: |
  "This pair of hammers is linked by a loose chain. While the two hammers are balanced to wield in melee together, the chain is long enough that you can throw one hammer a short distance and then pull it back; pulling the chain to retrieve the thrown hammer is a move action. The chain-hammer's maximum throwing range is 10 feet. Dwarf rangers are fond of using chain-hammers, often using a locked gauntlet to make sure one of the hammers remains secure."

### Description

This pair of hammers is linked by a loose chain. While the two hammers are _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Balanced|balanced]]_ to wield in melee together, the chain is long enough that you can throw one _[[items/Mundane/Hammer|hammer]]_ a short distance and then _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ it back; pulling the chain to retrieve the thrown _hammer_ is a move action. The _[[items/Weapon/Chain-hammer|chain-hammer]]_'s maximum _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Throwing|throwing]]_ range is 10 feet. Dwarf rangers are fond of using chain-hammers, often using a locked _[[items/Weapon/Gauntlet|gauntlet]]_ to make sure one of the hammers remains secure.
