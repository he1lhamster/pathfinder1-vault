Description: |
  "Jagged teeth stud the length of this falchion's blackened steel blade. Warped and twisted by the daemonic spirit trapped within, this former _+2 merciful falchion_ now tears the life's essence from its victims. The _Ravenous Blade_ acts as a _+2 wounding falchion_, and grants its wielder a +2 profane bonus to Charisma so long as it remains in her possession. Bleed damage dealt by the _Ravenous Blade_ takes the form of nonlethal starvation damage, as the blade slowly consumes the fat and meat of creatures it has tasted. Anyone who takes nonlethal damage from the sword's _wounding_ property becomes fatigued, just as if he had begun starving normally.
  Whenever the wielder kills or subdues a creature in combat (whether she does so with the _Ravenous Blade_ itself or not), she must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or she is overcome by hunger pangs, and is compelled to consume the flesh of her victim. Sating this compulsion is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity."
Destruction: |
  "The _Ravenous Blade_ must be driven into the heart of a good cleric, who must then gorge herself for 3 days and 3 nights uninterrupted until the sword has eaten its fill, at which point it rusts and crumbles."
