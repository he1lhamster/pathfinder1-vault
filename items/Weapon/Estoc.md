Description: |
  "An estoc is a sword about as long as a bastard sword, but designed exclusively for thrusting attacks. Its "blade" is a steel spike with a triangular, square, or hexagonal crosssection. Like the bastard sword, an estoc requires special training to use it one handed, but it can also be wielded as a two-handed martial weapon. When you wield an estoc with one hand, treat it as a one-handed weapon; when you wield an estoc with two hands, treat it as a two-handed weapon. If you can use the estoc proficiently with one hand, you can also use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls when wielding an estoc sized for you with one or two hands, even though it isn't a light weapon."
