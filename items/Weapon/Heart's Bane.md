Description: |
  "This sword of twisted black silver has a burst of dark flames adorning the hilt and a pommel shaped like a pair of clawed hands. Its blade continually sheds an aura of shadow equivalent to the _darkness_ spell. _Heart's Bane_ is a mithral _bastard's sting_ (_Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment_ 150); normally a _+2 mithral longsword_, it becomes a _+5 unholy mithral longsword_ (with all of the other abilities of a _bastard's sting_) in the hands of an antipaladin. _Heart's Bane_ also functions as a _bane_ weapon against creatures that worship Iomedae.
  _Heart's Bane_ grants the following abilities when wielded by an evil creature. The wielder gains a +6 profane bonus to AC and 60 additional hit points. As a swift action up to eight times per day, the wielder can gain a profane bonus equal to the sword's enhancement bonus on a single Charisma-based skill check or Charisma ability check. As a standard action three times per day, the wielder can force a good creature to reflect on its past misdeeds and be overcome by grief, as per _terrible remorse_ (_Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic_ 243). Once per day, the wielder can swing _Heart's Bane_ above her head as a standard action to create an _incendiary cloud_. Half the damage caused by the spell is fire damage and the other half results directly from unholy power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks."
Destruction: |
  "If Iomedae's current herald uses _Heart's Bane_ to deliver a coup de grace attack to an unwilling paladin of Iomedae, the sword shatters and is permanently destroyed."
