Description: |
  "_Riftcarver_ is an immense weapon carved from exoskeleton plates pried from the body of the now-long-forgotten monstrosity that birthed Deskari into the Abyss. The demon lord emerged fully formed, and the crafting of this weapon was among the first of his acts— _Riftcarver_ aided the demon lord tremendously in those first few thousand centuries of his life, and was the primary tool he used to dig the Rasping Rifts.
  _Riftcarver_ is a Gargantuan _+5 defending unholy wounding scythe_. As part of its first successful hit against a target in any one round, _Riftcarver_ can infest the creature hit with rot grubs (_Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide_ 245). Once per minute as a standard action by striking at the ground, _Riftcarver_ can create an _earthquake_ centered on the target's location. _Riftcarver's_ wielder never suffers any ill effects from earthquakes created by the scythe. Once per day, the scythe can be swept through the air as a standard action to rip a hole between worlds that serves as a 20-foot-diameter _gate_ —this _gate_ can be used only for planar travel, not for calling creatures. _Riftcarver_ is made of the chitin of an Abyssal monster, yet it is treated as adamantine for the purposes of damaging objects and penetrating hardness.
  Smaller versions of this artifact, built to be used by Medium cultists, also exist. Called _rotcarvers_, the majority of these weapons have been captured and destroyed by the crusaders by the Fifth Crusade. A _rotcarver_ is a _+3 scythe_ that can infest those it strikes with rot grubs, or can transform its user into a rot grub swarm. _Rotcarvers_ are detailed on page 51 of _Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lost Kingdoms_."
Destruction: |
  "If the remains of its ancient, forgotten source can be located and restored to life, _Riftcarver_ can be destroyed by using it to deliver a coup de grace against that creature. If the attack slays the resurrected horror, _Riftcarver_ crumbles to dust."
