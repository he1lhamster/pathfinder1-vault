Description: |
  "This left-handed black iron gauntlet appears little more than a dull soot-stained plated glove at first glance, but in truth it is a powerful boon granted by Droskar to his most faithful subjects. Placing the glove on your left hand causes excruciating pain as your appendage curls into a tight fist and then slowly transforms to supernaturally hard black stone. You cannot use your left hand for anything beyond smashing it into objects or creatures (you cannot carry a shield or secondary weapon and you take a -4 on skill checks that usually require two hands). The gauntlet cannot be removed without a successful casting of _remove curse_, _break enchantment_, or similar spell.
  The gauntlet grants you a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and acts as a _+1 adamantine gauntlet_. The item also grants you the ability to use the gauntlet as a secondary natural weapon. In addition, the _Grasp of Droskar_ allows its wearer to use _stone shape_ once per day."
