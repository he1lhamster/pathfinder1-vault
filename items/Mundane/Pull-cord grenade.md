Type: "Mundane"
Price: "150 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."

Description: |
  "This clay container resembles a fuse grenade, but trails a pulley and wire rather than a fuse. Pulling the cord (a move action) sparks a flint and steel within the device, causing the grenade to explode. The pull cord can be attached to a door or drawer within 5 feet, or strung across a 5-foot square, causing the grenade to detonate when its tripwire is disturbed. A pull-cord grenade cannot be reused.
  This can be crafted with a DC 25 Craft (traps) check.
