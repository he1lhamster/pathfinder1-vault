Title: "Ooze attractant"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "100 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "Drow alchemists of House Tracinoa developed this mixture to function as a lure for mindless oozes. You can throw a flask of ooze attractant as a splash weapon. On a direct hit, each mindless ooze within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 12 Will save or be compelled to approach the target for the next 1d4+1 rounds. On a miss, an ooze still attempts a Will save, but on a failure it instead approaches the square in which the flask landed. Once an ooze moves adjacent to the targeted creature or into the targeted square, it resumes its normal behavior. An ooze can be affected by ooze attractant only once in a 24-hour period."
