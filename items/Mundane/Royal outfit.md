  "Royal clothes are ostentatious, with gems, gold, silk, and fur in abundance. A royal outfit is rarely designed for regular wear or inclement weather—or even for donning unaided—as it's presumed that anyone who might be wearing it has plenty of servants to take care of his or her every need. This outfit includes only the clothing, not a royal scepter, crown, ring, or other regal accoutrements."
