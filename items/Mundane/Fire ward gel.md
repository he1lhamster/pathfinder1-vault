Title: "Fire ward gel"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "150 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "When you apply this thin gel to your skin, armor, or clothing, it creates a resistant barrier that protects you from fire or heat damage. You gain fire resistance 5. The gel burns away as it absorbs fire damage; when it absorbs a total of 20 points of fire damage, it is discharged. Fire ward gel counts as _protection from energy_ for the purpose of stacking multiple fire protection effects. Applying fire ward gel takes 1 minute, and it lasts for 1 hour before losing its potency. Multiple applications of fire ward gel do not stack; applying more while a dose is active merely resets the potential amount of fire damage absorbed to 20 points."
