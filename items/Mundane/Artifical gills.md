Title: "Artifical gills"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "50 gp"
Weight: "15 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "Flexible tubes connect a hand pump and a breathing mask to this reinforced leather backpack. When the hand pump is pressed, the artificial gills draw in oxygen from the surrounding water and feed it through the mask, allowing the wearer to breathe underwater for extended periods of time.
  The hand pump must be regularly depressed, requiring you to have a free hand and use a move action each round. If you do not squeeze the hand pump in a round, you must hold your breath or begin to suffocate. Artificial gills eventually become clogged with particulates and must be disassembled and cleaned after 1 hour of being submerged, although this time can be dramatically shortened by murky or polluted water.
  Artificial gills provide no protection against temperature dangers or pressure damage in the open seas. If artificial gills are submerged more than 100 feet below the surface, they take 1d6 points of damage per round until they are either brought into shallower water or they rupture from the pressure. Artificial gills have a hardness of 0, 10 hit points, and a break DC of 30."
