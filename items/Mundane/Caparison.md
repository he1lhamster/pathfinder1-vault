Description: |
  "A caparison is a sizable cloth covering laid over a mount or other four-legged creature. It serves many of the same purposes a cloak does for a humanoid creature, occupies the shoulder slot, and can be enchanted in the same manner. Caparisons are sometimes made of precious materials or crafted with delicate artistry—this does not increase their practicality, but can significantly increase their price as art objects."
