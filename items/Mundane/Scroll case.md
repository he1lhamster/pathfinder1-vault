Type: "Mundane"
Price: "1 gp"
Weight: "0.5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "A leather or wooden scroll case easily holds four scrolls; you can cram more inside, but retrieving any of them becomes a full-round action rather than a move action. You must destroy the scroll case to damage its contents (hardness 2 for leather or 5 for wood, 2 hit points, break DC 15). A scroll case is not watertight, and must still be protected from the elements."
