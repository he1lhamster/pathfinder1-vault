Title: "Beast whistle"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "5 gp"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This small wooden whistle emits a high-pitched sound like that of a signal whistle, except the signal is audible only to a specific type of creature—other types of creatures hear only a quiet hissing sound.
  Beast whistles come in six different varieties: avian, canine, feline, rodent, reptile, and ungulate (other varieties may be available at the GM's discretion). Animals and magical beasts that match a beast whistle's type can hear the whistle as a human hears a signal whistle. Creatures that fit into multiple categories (such as griffons) can usually hear the call of multiple types of whistles, though magical beasts who don't fit into any of the above categories cannot hear a beast whistle. Beast whistles don't function underwater, except if surrounded by an air bubble (_Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat_ 222) or similar effect, though creatures underwater may hear a beast whistle sounded from above the surface if they are close enough."
