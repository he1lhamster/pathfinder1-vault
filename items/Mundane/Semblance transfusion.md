Description: |
  "When combined with a drop of a humanoid's blood, this solution allows the homunculus that drinks it to grow to size Small and assume the likeness of the subject whose blood was used. If the homunculus can speak, its voice changes to resemble that of the subject. The homunculus's space and reach become 5 feet and it loses its bite attack, but otherwise its statistics remain unchanged. This transformation lasts 24 hours. The homunculus gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear as the subject, but unless the subject is a halfling, a gnome, a child, or another Small humanoid, the homunculus is likely shorter than the subject."
