Title: "Air tank"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "0.5 gp"
Weight: "0.5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "Tanks full of normal air don't last long as breathing devices, but a large air tank is excellent for ensuring a character has a swiftly rising buoyancy, and a savvy diver can adjust her air tank just enough to give her a neutral buoyancy, making it much easier to explore underwater. Every 6 gallons of air is enough to breathe for roughly 1 minute underwater; it takes far less air for a Medium creature to achieve neutral buoyancy unless it's carrying a significant amount of metal and other dense material."
