  _Sage, bergamot, and cedar ash_: This pungent aroma has an imposing effect. Any creature wearing this perfume gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks and does not take any penalties for attempting to Intimidate a larger opponent.
  _Sulfur and honeycomb_: This aroma is sometimes called "Hell's Smell." Any creature wearing this scent gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks and increases the DC of any compulsion subschool spells cast during this time by 2.
  Each vial of draconic perfume contains 1 application of the scent. Producing draconic perfume requires 1 vial of musk, the Dragoncrafting feat, and a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
