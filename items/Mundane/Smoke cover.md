Title: "Smoke cover"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "75 gp"
Weight: "10 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This small cauldron of alchemically treated tar gives off thick, acrid smoke when ignited. The smoke rises to an altitude of 25 feet, then spreads horizontally, creating an artificial smoke ceiling 5 feet thick. The smoke spreads to a 100-foot radius at a rate of 20 feet per round. The cauldron smokes for 5 rounds before burning out. After the cauldron finishes burning, the smoke lasts for 3 more rounds before dissipating. A moderate wind (11+ mph) does not affect the heavy smoke, while a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the smoke in 2 rounds.
  The smoke is entirely opaque, which means creatures above the smoke can't see the ground, and those on the ground have a visual ceiling of 25 feet. Creatures on the other side of the smoke have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target).
  Smoke cover is noxious, and any creature that begins its turn inside the smoke must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d4 rounds. Previously sickened creatures that fail their saves are instead nauseated for 1d6 rounds. Creatures immune to poison are not affected by smoke cover's sickening effects."

### Description

This small _[[items/Mundane/Cauldron|cauldron]]_ of alchemically treated tar gives off thick, acrid smoke when ignited. The smoke rises to an altitude of 25 feet, then spreads horizontally, creating an artificial smoke ceiling 5 feet thick. The smoke spreads to a 100-foot radius at a rate of 20 feet per round. The _cauldron_ smokes for 5 rounds before _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Burning|burning]]_ out. After the _cauldron_ finishes _burning_, the smoke lasts for 3 more rounds before dissipating. A moderate wind (11+ mph) does not affect the heavy smoke, while a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the smoke in 2 rounds.

The smoke is entirely opaque, which means creatures above the smoke can't see the ground, and those on the ground have a visual ceiling of 25 feet. Creatures on the other side of the smoke have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target).

_[[items/Mundane/Smoke cover|Smoke cover]]_ is noxious, and any creature that begins its turn inside the smoke must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or become _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ for 1d4 rounds. Previously _sickened_ creatures that fail their saves are instead _[[conditions/Nauseated|nauseated]]_ for 1d6 rounds. Creatures immune to poison are not affected by _smoke cover_'s sickening effects.
