Title: "Dragon's gut"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "50 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "A dragon's stomach contains highly corrosive acid that can be crafted into an alchemical item called dragon's gut. When used as a thrown splash weapon, dragon's gut deals 2d4 points of acid damage plus, on a direct hit, an additional 1d4 points of acid damage the following round, and it deals 1 point of acid damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the impact point as normal splash damage. Additionally, dragon's gut has alternate effects when used in place of acid as an alchemical power component (see _Pathfinder Player Companion: Adventurer's Armory_).
  _Acid arrow_: The spell lasts 1d3 rounds longer than usual.
  _Acid fog_: The fog takes on a sticky quality and clings to creatures within it. Any creature damaged by the _acid fog_ takes an additional 2d6 points of acid damage on the round after leaving the fog's area of effect. The creature can negate this additional damage by spending a standard action to wipe the clinging acid from its body.
  _Acidic spray_: The spell deals 1d8 points of acid damage per caster level (maximum 15d8) instead of the normal 1d6 per caster level on the round of its casting (Reflex half). It still deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels on the following round as normal.
  The Dragoncrafting feat and a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check are required to convert 1 vial of stomach acid into 1 vial of dragon's gut."
