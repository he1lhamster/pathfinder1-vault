  "This alkaline salt counteracts the properties of oozes' acid. You can apply acid neutralizer to a piece of equipment such as a weapon or shield as a move action. For 1 minute afterward, any acid damage that would be dealt to the protected equipment is reduced by 5 points. This does not reduce acid damage dealt to you or unprotected equipment.
  You can apply a dose of acid neutralizer to an adjacent ooze creature by emptying the container on it. Treat this as a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
