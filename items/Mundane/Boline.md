Description: |
  "Bolines are hook-shaped knives commonly used by herbalists and spellcasters to harvest ingredients for their craft. A boline's blade is typically 5 inches long, and is too small and irregular to use as a weapon. You can use a boline to finely slice the herbs in a healer's kit, so you can treat deadly wounds with only a single use from a healer's kit rather than two uses."
