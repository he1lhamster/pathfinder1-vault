Title: "Shard gel"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "25 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This vivid green gel instantly crystallizes into needle-like shards upon contact with the air. You can throw a flask of shard gel as a splash weapon. A direct hit deals 1d4 points of piercing damage as the shards penetrate the target's flesh. The target's square and each square adjacent to it are covered in shards that function like caltrops. The caltrops last for 5 rounds before dissolving into harmless green sludge. Any effect that deals sonic damage to an area (such as _sound burst_ or _shout_) immediately destroys all gel shards in that area. Crafting a flask of shard gel is a DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
