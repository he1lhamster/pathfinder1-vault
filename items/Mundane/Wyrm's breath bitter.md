Description: |
  "This green-tinged brew has a pungent, bitter bite. It's flavored with a variety of foulsmelling herbs and is intensely carbonated through a unique fermentation process. Sometimes given to visitors as a prank, wyrm's breath bitter causes the drinker to become sickened for 1d6 minutes (Fortitude DC 12 negates); dwarves gain a +5 racial bonus on this saving throw. After drinking a dose of wyrm's breath bitter, the drinker can, as a move action, unleash a thunderous and noxious belch in either a 5-foot-radius spread or a 10-foot cone. Creatures in the area are deafened and sickened for 1 round (Fortitude DC 12 negates). The drinker must wait 1d4 rounds before belching again, but can belch as often as desired for up to 10 minutes after drinking a wyrm's breath bitter."
