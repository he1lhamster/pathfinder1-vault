  "This sticky-sweet syrup is distilled from ivy and rabbit musk, and causes a mild allergic reaction in halflings. The slight swelling— especially in the face—and mild redness it induces makes the face seem younger, granting a halfling who drinks a dose of applecheek a +2 alchemical bonus on Disguise checks to look like an elven, half-elven, or human child. The effects of a dose of applecheek persist for 24 hours. Crafting a dose of applecheek requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check."
