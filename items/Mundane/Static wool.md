Description: |
  "Alchemical compounds in this square of jagged, metallic fibers store and transfer electricity into clothing when rubbed against the fabric for 1 minute. When you are grappled within the next 10 minutes while wearing this electrically charged clothing, as well as light armor or no armor, the electricity discharges. This deals 1 point of nonlethal electricity damage to the grappling creature, and if it takes damage from the effect, it must succeed at a DC 20 combat maneuver check to grapple or immediately release you. The DC increases to 22 against a creature with the grab ability. A single square of static wool can be used five times before expending its alchemical compounds."
