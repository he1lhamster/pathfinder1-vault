  "These secretions are only one of the many spores and fluids that the mu spores of Orv produce, but this is one of the few that surface dwellers have learned to safely use. This clear secretion can be added to any alchemical weapon, including an alchemist's bombs, as a move action. When mixed in this way, the affected alchemical weapon ignores half the hardness of any wooden objects it strikes. Alternatively, against creatures primarily made of wood (such as treants or wood golems), such weapons ignore the first 5 points of damage reduction the creatures has."
