Title: "Wing cloak"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "1200 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This strange piece of equipment only works for sylphs and similar creatures, whose light, airy bodies can be borne upon the winds. Looking like a fine silk traveler's cloak, a wing cloak is secretly reinforced with a series of wooden struts that, when locked into place, stretch the cloak's fabric into a rudimentary wing. Arranging the struts into a wing or reversing the change is a move action. When the cloak is shaped into a wing, the wearer can make a DC 15 Fly check to fall safely from any height without taking falling damage, as if using _feather fall_. When falling, the wearer may make an additional DC 15 Fly check to glide, moving 5 feet laterally for every 20 feet she falls. Readying and using a wing cloak requires two hands and provokes an attack of opportunity. A wing cloak has hardness 0 and 5 hit points. If the wing cloak is broken, the Fly DCs to use it increase by +10."
