Description: |
  "Sewn-in boning and laces allow this bodice to adjust your waist size in a way considered alluring by some cultures. The restrictive nature of this garment makes it a poor choice for combat or other athletic exertions, but you can easily conceal a thin knife in the corset's boning. The price varies greatly depending on the corset's quality; the cheapest corsets are made of simple cloth and cost mere silver pieces, while the most expensive feature silk brocade and are decorated with pearls or other costly adornments."
