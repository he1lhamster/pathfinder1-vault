Description: |
  "These straw baskets provide a portable home for bees. They are dome shaped, with a hole in the top that a smaller woven basket covers as a cap. This hole allows for the harvesting of small amounts of honey without destroying the entire hive. Believing that certain bees provide for a superior crop yield, some farmers pay beekeepers to travel to their farms with the bees.
  Destroying a traveling bee hive causes the bees to swarm, creating a 5-foot-radius cloud. A creature is blinded and for as long as it remains in the cloud, and must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude saving throw or become sickened for 1 minute. The sickened condition is a poison effect."
