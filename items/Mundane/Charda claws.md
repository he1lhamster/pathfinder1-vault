Description: |
  "This tiny set of sculpted claws, made from stone carefully chipped from the Battle of Charda monument (_Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Magnimar, City of Monuments_ 11), is set upon a fine chain. Once per day when attempting an Intimidate check to demoralize a single opponent in combat, the user can forcefully present the charda claws as part of the action to activate their residual power. Using the claws in this way requires a free hand, but only while the Intimidate check is made. If the Intimidate check was a success and the target is demoralized, the claws grant the wielder a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against that creature for the duration of the demoralized effect. If the wielder uses the claws but the Intimidate check is not successful, the claws' daily use is expended to no effect."
