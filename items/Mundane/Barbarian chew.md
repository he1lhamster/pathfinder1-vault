Price: "25 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "The Shoanti of the Cinderlands combine lime, crimson galtroot leaves, and some say horse blood to create this invigorating chew. Aside from staining the teeth a bloody shade, barbarian chew causes the user to feel stronger, but also angrier. One use of barbarian chew grants a barbarian +1 additional round of rage. This additional round is used first when a barbarian begins raging. If a barbarian does not rage within 1 hour of using the chew, this additional round of rage is lost. This benefit can be gained only once per day; consuming multiple doses in a 24-hour period has no additional effects. Barbarian chew can be created with a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
