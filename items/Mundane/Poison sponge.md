Title: "Poison sponge"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "150 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This spongy sac has a permeable membrane that can absorb, distill, and store toxins. When harvesting parts (see the Harvest Parts feat) from a poisonous creature, you can use a poison sponge to harvest and store one dose of the creature's poison instead. The DC to harvest poison is equal to 20 + the creature's CR, and the poison retains its potency for 3 days. A successful check stores a single dose of the creature's poison in the sponge, which you can then apply like any poison. Poison sponges become saturated over time, imposing a cumulative –2 penalty on checks to harvest poison each subsequent time they are used."
