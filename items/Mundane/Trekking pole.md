Type: "Mundane"
Price: "15 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This 5-foot-long pole is fitted with a metal spike at its base. A trekking pole is meant to assist with overland movement, particularly long hikes and travel through difficult terrain. If you use a trekking pole as part of overland movement, you increase your distance traveled by 10% (so a creature with a 30-foot base speed travels 3-1/3 miles in 1 hour of walking, instead of just 3 miles). While traveling in areas of impaired movement—such as a trackless desert or a swamp trail—the increase to distance traveled while using a trekking pole increases to 25%."
