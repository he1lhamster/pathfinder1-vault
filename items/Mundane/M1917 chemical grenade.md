  "The M1917 is a modified M1914 grenade specially modified and enlarged to release a cloud of toxic gas upon detonation. Resembling an overlarge metal can with a small lever and handle protruding from the bottom, the grenade is armed by pulling back on a metal firing pin held in place by the handle's depressed lever, which is released when thrown. At the beginning of your next turn, the grenade spews forth a cloud of mustard gas (see the sidebar on this page) in a 20-foot radius. The cloud disperses naturally after 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round."
