Description: |
  "This large contraption functions like a hooded lantern, shedding large amounts of light in a single direction. A spotlight also contains several mirrors which amplify and aim the light. A spotlight creates a 5-foot-wide beam of normal light, which extends to a distance of 90 feet and continues for another 90 feet as dim light. It does not radiate any light outside the area of the beam. A spotlight does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. A lantern burns for 1 hour on 1 pint of oil, and requires two hands to move and one hand to aim."
