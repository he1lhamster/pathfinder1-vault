Title: "Horn harness"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "30 gp"
Weight: "20 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This simple harness, basically just a leather lash, straps a combatant's arm to the tusk or horn of a Huge or larger animal such as a gorthek. Engaging or disengaging a horn harness is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A horn harness includes a quiver that typically holds up to 12 javelins. A creature in a horn harness gains all the bonuses and takes all the penalties for engaging in combat or casting spells while mounted (_Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook_ 202), but also can't do anything that requires using the hand lashed to the mount. If the mount falls in battle, the creature in the horn harness remains attached, but can attempt a DC 25 Ride check to make a soft fall. If the creature in the horn harness falls unconscious, it remains strapped in, but takes an amount of damage equal to the mount's trample damage (if any) each round the monster moves."
