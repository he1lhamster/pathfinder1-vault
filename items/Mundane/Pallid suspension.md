Weight: "–"
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This small vial contains an alchemical suspension that preserves a sample of pallid gift. This functions like plague powder (_Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures_ 213) for pallid gift (DC 20, see page 68), allowing the user to apply pallid gift to a weapon (a standard action, or whatever action the character normally takes to apply poison to a weapon if that is better) and deliver it as with an injury poison. Just as for plague powder, the creation of a pallid suspension exposes the crafter to the disease on each day of crafting."
