Title: "Sky mine"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "1000 gp"
Weight: "500 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "The dwarves of Highhelm fill these 20-foot-diameter cloth balloons with a secret and highly flammable gas (included in the price) and then release them into the sky over their enemies. To transform the balloons into decoys, dwarven siege warriors place dummies in cargo baskets beneath the balloons to look like balloonist scouts or snipers. Whoever releases the balloon can attempt a DC 15 Profession (driver), Knowledge (nature), or Wisdom check; if the check is successful, the balloon can be guided out to a maximum range of 300 feet, a far enough distance for archers to safely shoot the balloon with flaming arrows, causing it to explode in a devastating ball of fire. A detonated sky mine creates a 50-foot-radius burst of flame that deals 10d6 points of fire damage to anything in the area."
