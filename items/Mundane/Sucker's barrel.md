Title: "Sucker's barrel"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "4 gp"
Weight: "35 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "A sucker's barrel is constructed to appear to the casual eye exactly like a normal barrel. However, an inner barrier installed near one of the barrel's ends hides a cavity containing a bladder filled with water. This creates a false bottom such that, when the barrel is full, it weighs and feels the same as a barrel filled completely with more valuable liquid, such as alcohol or oil. In this way, a merchant can "fill" a barrel with a smaller quantity of a liquid (typically 75% of the barrel's total capacity) and then sell it as if it were a full barrel's worth."
