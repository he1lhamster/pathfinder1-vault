Description: |
  "This straitjacket (_Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures_ 250) is designed for use by a single person. The leather straps and arm restraints are accessible in such a way as to be tightened by the wearer. Restraining or releasing oneself through these mechanisms requires 1 minute of work. Once restrained, the wearer can attempt to escape from the straitjacket as normal (that is, without using the built-in releases). Using a practice straitjacket to train for escape requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 20 Escape Artist check. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks to escape from bindings, a grapple, a net, rope, or similar restraints. This bonus lasts for 24 hours."
