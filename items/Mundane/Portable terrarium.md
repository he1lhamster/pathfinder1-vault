Description: |
  "This small glass enclosure is 1 foot wide, 1 foot tall, and reinforced with a wooden or metal frame. Tiny air holes in the lid allow living creatures inside the portable terrarium to breathe, and the interior can be outfitted with a variety of substrates and other materials the creatures might require. A portable terrarium is usually fitted with straps so it can be tied to a pack. Diminutive and smaller creatures, such as some familiars, can be safely carried within a portable terrarium and have total cover while inside it. Healers and botanists often store living plants in these containers; a successful DC 12 Knowledge (nature) check is required to transplant a plant into a portable terrarium, and most plants can live in a portable terrarium indefinitely so long as they are properly tended."
