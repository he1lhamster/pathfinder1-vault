Price: "50 gp"
Weight: "0.5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "Made with dragon's gall, which is harvested from a recently deceased dragon's liver, Dahak's fire is a volatile alchemical reagent. Though inherently inert, the substance ignites when it comes into contact with fast-moving air, which makes it ideal for application to blades or arrows. When applied to a weapon or piece of ammunition as a standard action, the weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of fire damage on the next successful hit.
  The Dragoncrafting feat and a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check are required to convert 1 vial of dragon's gall into 1 application of Dahak's fire."
