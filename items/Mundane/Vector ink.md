  "This specialized ink can be mixed with a contact poison to make the poison last longer on paper. Once applied to a sheet of paper, the ink remains slightly tacky and keeps the poison effective for up to 1 week. Any creature that touches the writing (such as while opening a closed book or unraveling a scroll) must save against the contact poison. Once a creature has come in contact with the vector ink, the ink is expended. A single vial of vector ink is enough to write a single page of text on standard-sized parchment."
