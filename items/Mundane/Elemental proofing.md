Title: "Elemental proofing"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "100 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This alchemical gel comes in a large vial with a brush built into the stopper. It's used to coat the surface of objects, protecting them from a specific type of energy damage. Though elemental proofing is not harmful to the objects it coats, it acts as a contact poison to living creatures. Touching elemental proofing directly causes 1d4 points of damage and 1d4 rounds of sickness (a DC 14 Fortitude save negates the latter effect). Creatures immune to poison are likewise immune to the effects of contacting elemental proofing but gain no benefits from its application. When applied to weapons or armor, elemental proofing confers resistances to the coated object, but none to the wearer.
  Each vial of elemental proofing contains enough gel to coat one Large object, or two Medium or smaller objects. Once the applied gel dries, it absorbs 10 points of the specified type of elemental damage each round. Elemental proofing wears off after 24 hours, and multiple applications of the gel do not stack. There are four different types of elemental proofing: acid proofing provides acid resistance 10, flame proofing provides fire resistance 10, frost proofing provides cold resistance 10, and lightning proofing provides electricity resistance 10."

### Description

This alchemical gel comes in a large _[[items/Mundane/Vial|vial]]_ with a brush built into the stopper. It's used to coat the surface of objects, protecting them from a specific type of energy damage. Though _[[items/Mundane/Elemental proofing|elemental proofing]]_ is not harmful to the objects it coats, it acts as a contact poison to living creatures. Touching _elemental proofing_ directly causes 1d4 points of damage and 1d4 rounds of sickness (a DC 14 Fortitude save negates the latter effect). Creatures immune to poison are likewise immune to the effects of contacting _elemental proofing_ but gain no benefits from its application. When applied to weapons or armor, _elemental proofing_ confers resistances to the coated object, but none to the wearer.

Each _vial_ of _elemental proofing_ contains enough gel to coat one Large object, or two _[[classes/Medium|Medium]]_ or smaller objects. Once the applied gel dries, it absorbs 10 points of the specified type of elemental damage each round. _Elemental proofing_ wears off after 24 hours, and multiple applications of the gel do not stack. There are four different types of _elemental proofing_: acid proofing provides acid _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ 10, flame proofing provides fire _resistance_ 10, frost proofing provides cold _resistance_ 10, and lightning proofing provides electricity _resistance_ 10.
