Title: "Light of Axtarr"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "180 gp"
Weight: "0.5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "Originally brewed from waters adjacent to one of the Plane of Water's subaquatic suns, a vial of light of Axtarr glows like a candle until expended. A vial of light of Axtarr that is emptied underwater as a move action forms a small orb that sheds light like a sunrod for 1d6 hours, after which the item is expended. Such an underwater orb remains suspended in place, not sinking, floating, or drifting away unless moved by a creature. Above water, shaking a vial of light of Axtarr as a move action also makes it shed light like a sunrod for 1d6 hours, after which it is expended. Any area of normal light created by light of Axtarr protects creatures within it from cold temperatures as per _endure elements_. Alternatively, a spellcaster holding an unused vial of light of Axtarr can expend it as a free action to automatically succeed at a caster level check to cast a fire spell underwater. (Fire spells successfully cast underwater produce steam that still deals fire damage; for more details, see page 46 of _Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Aquatic Adventures_.) This alternative use does not cause the light of Axtarr to produce light. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 30 Craft (alchemy) check."
