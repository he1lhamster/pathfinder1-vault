Title: "Duo saw"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "100 gp"
Weight: "20 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "Sometimes referred to as a "misery whip," this long blade (between 4 and 12 feet) is lined with numerous metal teeth. Thick handholds at each end of the blade allow a Medium or larger creature to grip one end with both hands. When a creature pulls on a handle (a move action) with another creature on the opposite side ready to pull after, those wielders can use the duo saw to cut through an object at exceptional speeds. This maneuver deals 10 points of damage per round of sawing to an object, ignoring up to 5 points of hardness on any nonmetallic substance. These saws are typically employed in the felling of large trees."
