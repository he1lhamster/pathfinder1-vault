  "Armor vents can be built into a suit of medium or heavy armor to allow for better ventilation and reduce the wearer's fatigue in hot environs. The vents can be slid open at the discretion of the user to ensure proper air flow during the day and then closed up at night to better preserve heat. A suit of armor with armor vents weighs 5 lbs. less than one without and imposes only a –2 penalty (instead of –4) on Fortitude saves to avoid taking nonlethal damage from heat exposure, but also has 10 fewer hit points than normal because of its more intricate construction."
