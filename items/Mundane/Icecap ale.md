Title: "Icecap ale"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "40 gp"
Weight: "0.5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This rare and unusual brew is fortified by a process of repeated partial freezing, during which the ice is continually skimmed off, resulting in a draught with more than 10 times the alcohol content of ordinary ale. Icecap ale grants a +2 alchemical bonus to the drinker's Strength and Constitution for 1 minute, as well as a +4 alchemical bonus on saving throws against compulsions and fear. However, after this initial surge of energy, the drinker becomes fatigued and takes a –4 penalty on Dexterity- and Strength-based skill checks for 1 hour. In addition, the drinker loses all memory of events that transpired during the 1d4 minutes directly following consumption of a draught of icecap ale; a successful DC 20 Fortitude save negates this memory loss. Additional doses of icecap ale imbibed during the hour following an initial dose cause the drinker to become sickened for 1 minute (instead of gaining a bonus to Strength and Constitution) and to suffer all the negative effects of icecap ale."
