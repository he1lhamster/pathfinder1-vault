Weight: "–"
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This fiber is composed of tiny strands of razor-sharp glass laced with alchemical elements. Anyone who touches it finds her skin irritated by countless tiny abrasions. Though it causes only minor discomfort, it opens the skin enough for poison to seep through, allowing injury poisons to be delivered to the affected creature as if they were contact poisons. The abrasions last for 1 hour or until cleaned and treated with a successful DC 10 Heal check (a full-round action). Poisoners sometimes place spirit of glass in a target's wardrobe or amid her personal effects along with a rag soaked in poison. Spirit of glass is often mistaken for lint or loose cloth, though it and the abrasions it causes can be identified with a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check or DC 17 Heal check. Spirit of glass can be used only once before it is expended."
