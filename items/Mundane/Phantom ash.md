Description: |
  "Many Rivethun who study the old ways to better manage a traumatic injury use this concoction. Despite its evocative name, phantom ash has little to do with spectral spirits. Instead, when applied dry or moistened into a salve, this black dust causes a sensation of warmth when smeared on skin, and it removes any lingering pain or distracting sensations associated with a chronic injury, such as a lost or paralyzed limb. For 1 hour after each application, the user gains a +1 alchemical bonus on all saving throws against phantasm effects and effects that inflict pain."
