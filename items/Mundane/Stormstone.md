Title: "Stormstone"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "150 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "A stormstone functions like a thunderstone, but deals 1d6 points of sonic damage in addition to deafening creatures; a successful DC 15 Fortitude save halves the damage and reduces the deafness to 1 round rather than negating it.
  **Mythic**: If you expend one use of mythic power while throwing a stormstone, the item deals an amount of electricity damage equal to your mythic tier to all affected creatures, regardless of whether they succeed at their save. Creatures that fail their saving throws against a mythic stormstone become staggered for 1 round in addition to the other effects. The stormstone ignores non-mythic resistances, non-mythic immunity to electricity or sonic damage, and non-mythic silencing effects."
