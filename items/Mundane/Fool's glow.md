Description: |
  "A greasy paste of beeswax, pyrite, and various monster fluids, fool's glow reacts with light to confuse magical senses. For 12 hours after being smeared over an object or creature (a process requiring 1 minute), the fool's glow detects as faintly magical if examined with a _detect magic_ or _arcane sight_ spell, though no school or specific spell can be identified. With a successful DC 21 Craft (alchemy) or Spellcraft check, a character identifies the coating for what it is. A single jar of fool's glow can coat one Medium, two Small, or four Tiny or smaller objects. Crafting a jar of fool's glow requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
