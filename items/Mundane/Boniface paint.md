Description: |
  "This thick whitewash is laced with exotic oils, and it dries to a lovely finish run through with subtle swirls. Difficult to notice, these patterns help obscure seams and details in whatever the paint coats; the Perception DC to find a secret door or hidden compartment on a surface covered in boniface paint increases by 5. One bucket of boniface paint covers up to a 10-foot-by-10-foot area, and its concealing effects last for 1 year. Crafting a bucket of boniface paint requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
