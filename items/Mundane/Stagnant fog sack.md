Title: "Stagnant fog sack"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "80 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "Gathered within this tightly woven, alchemically treated canvas sack is a sample of the pervasive fetid fog that looms near the border of the Plane of Air and the Plane of Water. When opened, the fog billows out in a 30-foot-radius area. Sight is extremely limited in an area of stagnant fog. A creature within 15 feet has concealment (20% miss chance), while creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target). In addition, creatures that end their turn within the cloud must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or become sickened for 1 round. Stagnant fog dissipates naturally after 1 minute. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the stagnant fog in 1 round. This item can be crafted with a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
