Title: "Bone paste"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "75 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "Typically stored in an airtight leather wineskin cured with rare preservative unguents, bone paste is a powerful alchemical sealant with special deteriorative properties. When squeezed out of its container and exposed to air, bone paste quickly hardens, so in order to apply it to a surface or object one must typically squeeze the paste directly onto the material to be affected. Once applied, bone paste cements itself to the object in just seconds, and hardens into a flaky cast. If applied to any unattended organic material or surface (such as wood, paper, hide, or rope), after 1 hour, bone paste undergoes another alchemical reaction and begins to eat away at the material, dealing 1d4 points of damage each round for 1d6+1 rounds, eating away first at the part of the object to which it was applied and spreading briefly to other parts of the object before dissipating and leaving a small amount of residual dust. Bone paste ignores an organic object's hardness, and does not deal damage to inorganic objects or surfaces (such as metal, stone, or ceramic). One pouch of bone paste is enough to cover 1 square foot of surface, or (because of waste and spills) up to 20 smaller applications of approximately 2 square inches each."
