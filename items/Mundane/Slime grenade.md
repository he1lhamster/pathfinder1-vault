Title: "Slime grenade"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "100 gp"
Weight: "3 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "The alchemists of Nex have found several uses for the toxic residue left over from their massive ooze cultivating experiments, including a variety of items known collectively as slime grenades. These ceramic ovoids are filled with caustic sludge and capped with a stone plug. You can throw a slime grenade as a splash weapon with a range increment of 5 feet. A successful ranged touch attack coats the target with green slime, dealing 2d6 points of acid damage to the creature. If the target is wearing wooden or metal armor or wielding a wooden or metal shield, a slime grenade eats through the material on a hit, dealing 3d6 points of acid damage to the equipment and ignoring the items' hardness. Creatures in the splash radius of a slime grenade take no damage, but any wooden or metal armor or shields they are wearing take 1d6 points of acid damage (ignoring hardness). Affected creatures can attempt DC 15 Reflex saves to halve the damage dealt to their equipment."
