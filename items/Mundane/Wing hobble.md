Title: "Wing hobble"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "75 gp"
Weight: "10 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This large weight is attached to a sharp steel hook which doubles as a carabiner. Once the steel hook is punched through the skin of a flying creature's wing, the carabiner locks shut. The weight then acts as an anchor, unbalancing the creature's wings, which prevents the creature from flying. The application of wing hobbles causes 1d4 points of piercing damage, and does not permanently disable the creature should the hobble be removed. A wing hobble can be attached to a pinned creature's wing with a successful grapple check. Removing a wing hobble from a creature's wing is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity and requires the use of two hands."
