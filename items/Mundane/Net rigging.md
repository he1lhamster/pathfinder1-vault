Type: "Mundane"
Price: "250 gp"
Weight: "40 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This large bundle of ropes, pulleys, netting, and latches can be assembled to form two different traps: one to drop a net from above, and another to snag trespassers from below and hoist them into the air. Either configuration requires an overhead structure such as a ceiling, a crossbeam, or a sturdy tree branch to support the trap's mechanisms and counterweights. Net rigging has an effective Strength score of 19 for the purpose of determining how much weight it can lift.
  This can be crafted with a DC 25 Craft (traps) check.
  ### Falling Net Trap
