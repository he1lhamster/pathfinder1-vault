Title: "Monster mask"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "7.5 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This articulated mask resembles a specific type of humanoid monster, such as a bugbear, goblin, orc, or hobgoblin. The mouth opens and closes when you move your jaw and its skin is actually carefully-painted cloth. Though such masks are usually intended for theater performances where an actor plays the role of a monster, adventurers have been known to use them to help blend in with monsters of the appropriate type. The mask negates the –2 Disguise DC for disguising yourself as a different race, but only at a distance of at least 20 feet or when you have concealment; closer than this distance or in clearer circumstances, the mask is obviously a false representation. It only covers your face and is normally worn with a wig or helmet to disguise or cover the rest of your head. Each mask is most suitable for a wearer of a particular size, though some size and monster combinations are less believable than others (a Small creature in an orc mask may be able to pass as an orc child, but a Medium creature in a goblin mask at best looks like a deformed hobgoblin)."

### Description

This articulated _[[items/Mundane/Mask|mask]]_ resembles a specific type of humanoid monster, such as a _[[monsters/Bugbear|bugbear]]_, _[[monsters/Goblin|goblin]]_, _[[monsters/Orc|orc]]_, or _[[monsters/Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]]_. The mouth opens and closes when you move your jaw and its skin is actually carefully-painted cloth. Though such masks are usually intended for theater performances where an actor plays the role of a monster, adventurers have been known to use them to help _[[spells/Blend|blend]]_ in with monsters of the appropriate type. The _mask_ negates the –2 Disguise DC for disguising yourself as a different race, but only at a distance of at least 20 feet or when you have concealment; closer than this distance or in clearer circumstances, the _mask_ is obviously a false representation. It only covers your face and is normally worn with a _[[items/Mundane/Wig|wig]]_ or helmet to disguise or cover the rest of your head. Each _mask_ is most suitable for a wearer of a particular size, though some size and monster combinations are less believable than others (a Small creature in an _orc_ _mask_ may be able to pass as an _orc_ child, but a _[[classes/Medium|Medium]]_ creature in a _goblin_ _mask_ at best looks like a deformed _hobgoblin_).
