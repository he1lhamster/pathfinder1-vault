Title: "Flight grapnel"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "50 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This masterfully crafted grappling hook sports hinged flukes that collapse down to the sides of the hook's base. A collapsed flight grapnel is thrown like a dart (typically while attached to rope), and the flukes spring out only when it strikes a solid object. This makes the grappling hook more aerodynamic, though heavier. A flight grapnel acts as a grappling hook in all ways, except it's treated as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet."
