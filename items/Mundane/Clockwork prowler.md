Title: "Clockwork prowler"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "500 gp"
Weight: "25 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This 2-foot-tall wooden clockwork automaton is shaped roughly like a short-backed, wheeled chair. When wound up with the folding handle at its side, the clockwork prowler trundles forward at a speed of 15 feet per round for up to 2 minutes. A clockwork prowler cannot move through difficult terrain. Each round of vigorous winding powers 2 rounds of movement. If its brake is not released immediately after winding, the prowler loses 1 round of movement for every 2 rounds it sits idle. The clockwork prowler can carry up to 20 pounds of weight at full speed, or up to 50 pounds at a speed of 10 feet. Higher weights prevent the prowler from moving. A clockwork prowler has hardness 5 and 90 hit points, and when in motion has AC 12 (a motionless clockwork prowler has AC 5)."
