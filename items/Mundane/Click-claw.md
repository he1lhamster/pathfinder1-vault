Title: "Click-claw"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "2 gp"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This small metallic device resembles a crab's claw. When the item is pinched and released, friction on the claw's inner surface creates a loud clicking noise that carries up to a half mile underwater. The intensity of the sound decreases as the click passes through water, providing a listener familiar with the sound a general sense of the distance and direction of the noise's origin (Perception DC 0, +1 per 100 feet between the click-claw and the listener). Click-claws are particularly useful for keeping a group together in murky water, and many undersea animal handlers train their animals to respond to the noise."
