Type: "Mundane"
Price: "150 gp"
Weight: "0.5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "For some unknown reason, this finely crafted but mundane monkey statue repulses oni. Any creature with the oni subtype (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3_ 307) that is within 30 feet of a monkey statue takes a –1 penalty on all d20 rolls. The monkey statue can be unattended or presented by its wielder as a swift action to cause this effect; the statue has no effect on oni if it is simply stored on a wielder's person. A wielder must have a free hand available to present the statue and gain its effect. This penalty does not stack with that from other monkey statues."
