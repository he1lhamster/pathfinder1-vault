Type: "Mundane"
Price: "25 gp"
Weight: "0.5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "These small rubber cones attach to a creature's fangs and allow it to potentially poison those it bites. Poison caps must be filled with an injury poison (see pages 557–560 of the _Core Rulebook_), and must be attached to a creature's teeth prior to use. A creature equipped with poison caps deals bite damage as a creature one size smaller than usual, but the next time the creature makes a successful bite attack, it also injects the poison from the caps into its target. The price and weight listed above are for a pair of poison caps; both must be used simultaneously in order to be effective. A pair of poison caps can only be used once; they are effectively destroyed after a successful bite attack. The cost of the poison is not included in the cost of the poison caps."
