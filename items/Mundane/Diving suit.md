  "This one-piece suit of clothing reduces one's drag in the water, making swimming easier. It provides a +1 circumstance bonus on Swim checks. The suit only grants this bonus if it is the outermost garment, and has no effect if worn over bulky clothes or armor or with cumbersome gear (such as a backpack, large weapons, and so on).
