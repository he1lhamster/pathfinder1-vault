Title: "Buoy (common)"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "0.5 gp"
Weight: "16 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "A buoy is used to mark a specific spot in a lake, river, or similar body of water, making it possible for you to return to that location at a later date. A common buoy includes a float (typically an air-filled bladder or sealed gourd), a 200-foot length of twine, and a 15-pound stone used as an anchor. The float is usually painted a vivid color, and may have a small flag to attract attention. Though anchor buoys prove quite resilient to normal weather and tides, they offer little challenge to intelligent creatures determined to sabotage them. A superior buoy has a spherical or ovoid hollow metal float (typically copper), a length of chain rather than twine, and a metal anchor rather than a weight."
