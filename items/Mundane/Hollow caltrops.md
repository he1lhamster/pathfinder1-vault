Title: "Hollow caltrops"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "451 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "Created by adherents of Norgorber to lure pursuers to their deaths, hollow caltrops each have a hidden chamber built inside them. Hollow caltrops work just like normal caltrops, except they are considered masterwork weapons (+1 bonus on attack rolls), and they can be filled with poison. A single dose of poison can be applied to an entire 2-pound bag of caltrops after 10 minutes of work. Doing so requires a delicate hand, and there is a 5% chance of poisoning yourself unless you have the poison use class feature or a similar ability. Hollow caltrops can be further enchanted as per melee weapons, treating one 2-pound bag as a single melee weapon. If any of the magic caltrops are lost, all the caltrops lose any magic abilities until the missing caltrops are returned or replaced. Hollow caltrops can't have the serrated special feature or the shrapnel special feature."
