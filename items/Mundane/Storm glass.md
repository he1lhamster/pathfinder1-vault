Title: "Storm glass"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "80 gp"
Weight: "5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "Heavy gray mist fills the interior of a storm glass, a receptacle lined with thin metal strips and equipped with metal tuning forks jutting from inside the top and bottom of the glass. The forks are attuned to the Material Plane and can detect planar anomalies or intrusions, specifically the presence of outsiders. The mist within a storm glass changes coloration after 1 minute of being within 60 feet of a nonnative outsider (including creatures possessed by non-native outsiders), and grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks to identify such creatures. The color change lasts as long as the jar remains within range of an outsider and for 1d4+1 rounds after leaving the area. Removing the storm glass from the Material Plane (including placing it in extraplanar containers such as a portable hole) causes the gas to permanently revert to a colorless, inert vapor."
