Title: "Portable bolt trap"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "125 gp"
Weight: "9 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This specialized heavy crossbow is hooked to a trip line that can be strung across any opening up to 10 feet wide, much like that of a bell tripwire trap (see above). When the line is tripped, the crossbow fires its bolt toward the space where the line was tripped. The crossbow must have line of effect to the target space for the trap to work. Placing a portable bolt trap requires 10 minutes of effort to properly calibrate the shot and conceal the line and crossbow. The trap can be placed in as little as 1 minute, but doing so imposes a –4 penalty on the crossbow's attack roll, and the DC of the Perception check to notice the trap is reduced by 4. The trap has the following statistics.
