Description: |
  "Alchemical pheromones are variously colored liquids typically stored in glass vials. These pheromones combine the natural scent of an animal (such as a wolf), humanoid (such as a human), magical beast (such as a unicorn), or vermin (such as a centipede) with alchemical reagents that enhance and refine that scent, making the concoction potent enough to modify the behavior of a creature. A dose of alchemical pheromones must be created for the animal, magical beast, or vermin type or for a single subtype of humanoid; it typically affects only creatures of that type or subtype. The effects of the alchemical pheromone depend on the type.
  When it is smeared onto a surface or it is thrown as a splash weapon, the alchemical pheromone fills a 5-foot-radius area with its scent. The scent then remains active for 1 minute. A creature of the targeted type or subtype that enters that area must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be subject to the effects of the pheromone for 1 round. If the creature remains in the affected area, it must attempt a new saving throw each round as long as the pheromone remains active. All alchemical pheromones are mind-affecting effects, but swarms (as well as any other collection of creatures that acts as a single creature) are not immune to them. Creatures that don't need to breathe are immune to alchemical pheromones, while creatures with the scent ability take a –4 penalty on saving throws against them.
  **Aggression**: Affected creatures are driven into a mindless frenzy, as if affected by simultaneous _confusion_ and _rage_ spells.
  **Arousal**: Affected creatures are aroused and distracted, causing them to lose their Dexterity bonus to AC.
  **Simple**: An affected creature is staggered for 1 round. Whether the target succeeds at or fails the saving throw, it becomes immune to simple alchemical pheromones for 24 hours.
  **Susceptibility**: Affected creatures are forced to obey one specific, simple command, as if affected by a _command_ spell. The command is chosen when the pheromone is created, and must be a something simple, such as approach, drop, fall, flee, or halt (as defined by the _command_ spell)."

### Description

Alchemical pheromones are variously colored liquids typically stored in glass vials. These pheromones combine the natural _[[universal monster rules/Scent|scent]]_ of an animal (such as a _[[monsters/Wolf|wolf]]_), humanoid (such as a human), magical beast (such as a _[[monsters/Unicorn|unicorn]]_), or vermin (such as a centipede) with alchemical reagents that enhance and refine that _scent_, making the concoction _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ enough to modify the behavior of a creature. A dose of alchemical pheromones must be created for the animal, magical beast, or vermin type or for a single subtype of humanoid; it typically affects only creatures of that type or subtype. The effects of the alchemical pheromone depend on the type.

When it is smeared onto a surface or it is thrown as a splash weapon, the alchemical pheromone fills a 5-foot-radius area with its _scent_. The _scent_ then remains active for 1 minute. A creature of the targeted type or subtype that enters that area must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be subject to the effects of the pheromone for 1 round. If the creature remains in the affected area, it must attempt a new saving throw each round as long as the pheromone remains active. All alchemical pheromones are mind-affecting effects, but swarms (as well as any other collection of creatures that acts as a single creature) are not immune to them. Creatures that don't need to breathe are immune to alchemical pheromones, while creatures with the _scent_ ability take a –4 penalty on saving throws against them.

**Aggression**: Affected creatures are driven into a mindless frenzy, as if affected by simultaneous _[[spells/Confusion|confusion]]_ and _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ spells.

**Arousal**: Affected creatures are aroused and distracted, causing them to lose their Dexterity bonus to AC.

**Simple**: An affected creature is _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1 round. Whether the target succeeds at or fails the saving throw, it becomes immune to simple alchemical pheromones for 24 hours.

**Susceptibility**: Affected creatures are forced to obey one specific, simple _[[spells/Command|command]]_, as if affected by a _command_ spell. The _command_ is chosen when the pheromone is created, and must be a something simple, such as approach, drop, fall, flee, or halt (as defined by the _command_ spell).
