Type: "Mundane"
Price: "40 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "When lit, this foot-long wooden tube begins to hiss and emit puffs of smoke. One round later it takes flight, moving in a straight line at a speed of 90 feet for 1d6 rounds before exploding in a burst of thick, colorful smoke. Each square the firework passes through during its flight fills with smoke (treat the effect as a fog cloud spell, except a moderate or stronger wind dissipates the smoke in 1 round), as does an area in a 15- foot radius surrounding the point at which the rocket exploded. This smoke stings the eyes and inflames the lungs, and a creature that begins its turn in a square filled with smoke must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or be sickened for 1d4 rounds."
