Title: "Imperial conquest"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "250 gp"
Weight: "4 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This strategy game, best played with an elaborate ebony board and intricate ivory pieces, follows deceptively simple rules with great strategic depth. While the game can be played with less expensive sets, only a suitably intricate and well-crafted game set can generate the state of mind necessary to gain the tactical benefits of the game. Imperial conquest is a great intellectual pursuit across the breadth of the Padishah Empire, but the game has only recently begun to spread through the Inner Sea region.
  Up to four people can play a game of imperial conquest, which generally takes 1–2 hours (4d20+20 minutes). At the end of an uninterrupted game, each player attempts a DC 20 Intelligence check, with success granting tactical insights. For the next 8 hours, any character who succeeded at the Intelligence check gains a +1 bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity; when two players who succeeded at the Intelligence check flank the same enemy during this time, the bonus on attack rolls from flanking increases by 1."
