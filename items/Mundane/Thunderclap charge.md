  "Used by the dwarves of Dongun Hold to excavate precious crystals from deep underground, this heavy ceramic canister is packed with inert fibers surrounding a large alchemically infused blackpowder charge with a fuse. Lighting the fuse is a move action; 1d3 rounds after the fuse is lit, the charge explodes, dealing 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of sonic damage in a 10-foot-radius burst (Reflex DC 15 half). Creatures in the area of effect are knocked prone and deafened (a successful saving throw negates being knocked prone and reduces the deafened condition to 1 round). Crafting a thunderclap charge requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
