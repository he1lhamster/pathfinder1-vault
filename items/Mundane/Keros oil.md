Title: "Keros oil"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "5 gp"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "Also known as firebreather's oil, this bitter liquid is harder to ignite than common oil but burns quickly at a low temperature, making it ideal for exotic performers such as fire-spinners and flame-spitters. You may spit a mouthful of keros oil past an open flame (such as a candle, tindertwig, or torch) to ignite it, creating a brief burst of fire. If you use it to attack, the attack is a ranged touch attack with a maximum range of 5 feet that deals 1d3 points of fire damage. If you roll a 1 on your attack roll, you accidentally inhale or swallow some of the burning fuel; you take 1d6 points of fire damage and are nauseated for 1 round. A bottle of keros oil holds enough for 10 mouthfuls; taking a mouthful from the bottle is a standard action (the Rapid Reload feat reduces this to a move action). Crafting this item is a DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check."
