Title: "Poisoned sand tube"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "1 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "Resembling a slim scroll case made of bamboo or metal, this tube is filled with fine sand that is soaked or coated with inhaled or contact poison. When loaded with 3 doses of these types of poison, you can blow into the tube to disperse the poisoned sand into your enemies' faces in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the cone is affected as if afflicted with 1 dose of the poison. Even when loaded with unpoisoned sand, the tube lets loose a powerful irritant, and an opponent struck must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude saving throw or be dazzled for 1 round. Once expended, the tube must be repacked before it can be used again. Repacking a tube requires a full-round action, or a standard action if you have the Rapid Reload feat."
