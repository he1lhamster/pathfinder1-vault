Title: "Consecrated weapon"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "150 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "Consecrated weapons may be of any type—swords, axes, masterwork, mithral, and even magical—and function appropriately. When activated, the cleric charges the weapon with positive or negative energy (as appropriate) so it deals extra damage when it hits a target. This functions like the Channel Smite feat, except the additional damage is equal to half the cleric's channel energy damage (the target makes a Will save as normal, based on the cleric's channel energy DC). The weapon remains charged with this energy until it successfully strikes a creature or 24 hours pass, whichever comes first. Creatures other than the cleric are able to use the charged weapon and this ability."
