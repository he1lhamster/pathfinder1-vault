Type: "Mundane"
Price: "20 gp"
Weight: "25 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This device is a chair, typically made from wood, with large wheels attached on either side. A wheelchair can seat a single Medium or Small creature. When seated in a wheelchair, you can propel yourself along a reasonably flat surface at your base speed as a move action, so long as you have at least one hand free. Moving twice in a round or taking the run action requires you to have both hands free. Moving uphill or over rough terrain halves the speed you move in a wheelchair, and certain terrain (such as fallen logs) may be entirely impassable. A wheelchair has hardness 5 and 30 hit points."
