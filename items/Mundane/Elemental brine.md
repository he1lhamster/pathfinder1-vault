Title: "Elemental brine"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "500 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This alchemical substance is produced from saltwater from the Plane of Water. It has no effect on natives of that plane, but grants unusual properties when consumed by creatures from the Material Plane.
  Any creature with the water affinity racial trait, including undines, that drinks elemental brine finds her innate magic bolstered. If the creature is a sorcerer with the elemental (water) bloodline, she casts her bloodline powers and spells at +1 caster level. If the creature is a cleric with the Water domain, she treats her Wisdom modifier as 2 points higher for Water domain powers and spells. This does not grant early access to level-based powers; it only affects powers that she could already use without this trait. This benefit lasts 24 hours.
  Creatures with the aquatic subtype that imbibe elemental brine become immune to poison, although poisons active when the brine is imbibed still run their course. If the creature dwells in saltwater, it also becomes undetectable by scent for the same duration. Both of these effects last 24 hours.
  Finally, elemental brine can be used as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. While it has little effect on most creatures (other than soaking them in salty water) when used in this way, a bottle of elemental brine is quite lethal if it's flung at a creature with the fire subtype. On a direct hit, a creature with the fire subtype takes 2d6 points of damage, and creatures with the fire subtype in adjacent squares take 1d4 points of damage. In addition, a direct hit against a creature with the fire subtype creates a unique interplay between elemental brine's salt and water and the creature's flames, making the target more conductive and thus more susceptible to electrocution. Anytime the target would take electricity damage within the next minute, it must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or take 1-1/2 times as much electricity damage as normal."

### Description

This alchemical substance is produced from saltwater from the Plane of Water. It has no effect on natives of that plane, but grants unusual properties when consumed by creatures from the Material Plane.

Any creature with the water affinity racial trait, including undines, that drinks _[[items/Mundane/Elemental brine|elemental brine]]_ finds her innate magic bolstered. If the creature is a _[[classes/Sorcerer|sorcerer]]_ with the elemental (water) bloodline, she casts her bloodline powers and spells at +1 caster level. If the creature is a _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ with the Water domain, she treats her Wisdom modifier as 2 points higher for Water domain powers and spells. This does not grant early access to level-based powers; it only affects powers that she could already use without this trait. This benefit lasts 24 hours.

Creatures with the aquatic subtype that imbibe _elemental brine_ become immune to poison, although poisons active when the brine is imbibed still run their course. If the creature dwells in saltwater, it also becomes undetectable by _[[universal monster rules/Scent|scent]]_ for the same duration. Both of these effects last 24 hours.

Finally, _elemental brine_ can be used as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. While it has little effect on most creatures (other than soaking them in salty water) when used in this way, a _[[items/Mundane/Bottle|bottle]]_ of _elemental brine_ is quite lethal if it's flung at a creature with the fire subtype. On a direct hit, a creature with the fire subtype takes 2d6 points of damage, and creatures with the fire subtype in adjacent squares take 1d4 points of damage. In addition, a direct hit against a creature with the fire subtype creates a unique interplay between _elemental brine_'s salt and water and the creature's flames, making the target more _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Conductive|conductive]]_ and thus more susceptible to electrocution. Anytime the target would take electricity damage within the next minute, it must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or take 1-1/2 times as much electricity damage as normal.
