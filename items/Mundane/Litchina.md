Title: "Litchina"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "100 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "Though Taramai is long dead, and that first Keleshite invasion now little more than scattered stone foundations crumbling amid the grass, his legacy remains a point of great cultural pride among the Kara, with several leaders since having claimed to be his reincarnation. Taramai also pioneered the now-standard Kara practice of wearing the litchina—a metal face mask sculpted to match a given warrior's face, so that the enemy can never read any fear or pain in a Kara's expression. Each warrior must earn his or her litchina in battle, and most Kara would sooner fight naked than go without theirs.
  To be worn properly, a litchina must be attached to a helm or headpiece of some sort (usually via small hooks). While worn in this manner, it grants the wearer a +1 competence bonus to Intimidate. A magically enhanced litchina can count as occupying either the head, headband, or eyes slot (determined at the time of item creation). A standard litchina costs 100 gp and weighs 2 pounds."
