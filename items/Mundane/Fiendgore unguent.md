Title: "Fiendgore unguent"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "75 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "When this unguent—prepared with vile alchemical reagents and the gore of fiends—is applied to a wounded tiefling or evil outsider (not currently at maximum hit points), it momentarily transforms the essence of the target into something even more fearsome and demonic. While under the effects of a fiendgore unguent, a tiefling or an evil outsider gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks and a +1 circumstance bonus to the DC of all spells with the fear descriptor that they cast. Applying the unguent is a delicate process, requiring a full-round action, and can only be properly applied to a willing or helpless creature. If applied to a creature other than a tiefling or an evil outsider, it sickens the creature instead. The unguent's effects (either beneficial or harmful) last for 1 minute."
