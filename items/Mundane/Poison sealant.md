Weight: "–"
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "Applied poison generally washes off weapons underwater in 1d10 rounds unless the poison is contained inside the weapon and injected, so undersea alchemists developed poison sealant to circumvent this limitation. Applying poison sealant to a poisoned weapon takes the same amount of effort as applying a poison. Once applied, the sealant protects the poison from the elements, keeping the weapon poisoned underwater. Poison sealant dissolves in blood, allowing the poison's delivery (and also meaning that it doesn't prevent accidental poisoning)."
