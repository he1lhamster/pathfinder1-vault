Title: "Automatic writing planchette"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "25 gp"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This finely crafted, heart-shaped wooden board has two delicate wheels and a small aperture to hold a pencil, which acts as the board's third leg. Typically used on a tabletop covered in butcher's paper, the device scribbles out mysterious messages when employed by a creature using the automatic writing occult skill unlock, and provides a +2 circumstance bonus on the Linguistics check. When used to channel certain haunts capable of communication (see page 230), the planchette doubles the rate of communication with the haunt, and grants the user a +4 circumstance bonus on Linguistics checks to decipher the cryptic messages. These benefits do not stack with those of other items that confer similar benefits (such as a talking board)."
