  "This bauble, bit of clothing, or relic has some minor historical significance. Though not especially valuable, it's useful to an occultist, who can use it as an implement. Any such item is nonmagical, even if it appears to be a rod or wand. Implements that already have a mundane version with a price higher than 10 gp (such as armor, shields, weapons, and harrow decks) use their normal item entries instead of this catchall."
