Title: "Tiller's gum"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "100 gp"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This gum has alchemical properties that allow it to soak up magical energy and release it when the gum is chewed. As a standard action, a stick of tiller's gum can be imbued with a spell of up to 3rd level with a casting time of less than 1 minute and that targets one or more creatures, as if the gum were the target of the spell. The gum holds the spell's charge for 1 hour, during which time a creature capable of casting the stored spell can chew the gum as a standard action to gain the spell's effects, expending the stored spell and destroying the gum. The stored spell uses the original caster's level to determine its effects. If the spell-imbued gum isn't used before an hour passes, it is ruined. Crafting a stick of tiller's gum requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
