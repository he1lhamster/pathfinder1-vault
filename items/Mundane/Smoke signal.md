Description: |
  "This alchemically fused powder ball creates a plume of brightly colored smoke when lit. While the smoke is not thick enough to significantly impair vision, it is clearly visible up to 1d6 miles away under average conditions, and may be visible at greater distances in ideal conditions. Many desert clans use particular signature colors of smoke to indicate their allegiance, or use smoke signals with specific colors or in a pattern of sequential colors to convey coded messages."
