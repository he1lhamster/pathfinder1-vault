Description: |
  "This sealed copper tube contains a packet of alchemical fertilizer and several sprouted seedlings from the First World. Once shaken and opened as a standard action, the tube exudes a multitude of vines that spill into an adjacent square for 3 rounds. Left alone, these vines create an area of difficult terrain in the square, but a creature holding the tube can shape the vines as they emerge into a crude tool, piece of furniture, or other object of wood or rope weighing 20 pounds or less with a successful DC 10 Craft (baskets or carpentry) check. The vine construct lasts for 10 minutes before crumbling to pieces. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
