Title: "Corrosenze"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "90 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This gritty sand bonds to surfaces that resist energy damage, corroding the protection. Corrosenze can be applied to a weapon as if it were a poison. A creature struck with a weapon coated with corrosenze has its energy resistance reduced by 5 for 5 minutes (no saving throw), with the energy type correlating with the corrosenze's color: rust-colored corrosenze affects acid resistance, salt-colored affects cold, granitecolored affects electricity, and ash-colored affects fire. As a full-round action, the target can attempt a DC 15 Reflex saving throw to scrape off the corrosenze and regain its lost energy resistance. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
