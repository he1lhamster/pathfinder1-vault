Title: "Waspguts"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "100 gp"
Weight: "2 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This golden, oily alchemical reagent can be applied to any surface or delivered as a touch attack (the wielder exposes herself unless she uses a glove and disposes of it afterward). A creature or object marked with waspguts attracts angry insects. Vermin within 30 feet attack the target over other available creatures. Wasps are affected at a range of up to 1 mile; in most environments where wasps live, the target is stung by at least one wild wasp per hour. The effect lasts 8 hours or until washed or scraped off (a full-round action). Waspguts can also be thrown as a splash weapon. A direct hit deals no damage, but exposes the target to the waspguts' effects. Crafting waspguts requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
