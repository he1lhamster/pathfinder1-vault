Title: "Sunsoil"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "50 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "Created by dwarves after the Quest for Sky, this faintly glowing collection of minerals allows photosynthetic plants to grow in underground environments without sunlight. Sunsoil has since spread to a handful of agricultural communities throughout the Darklands, particularly among duergar plantations and svirfneblin enclaves. One pound of sunsoil covers a 20-footby- 20-foot area of regular earth and takes 1 minute to distribute evenly. A treated area allows plants to grow without sunlight for 4 months. Light-based spells and magical effects trigger an alchemical reaction in sunsoil. Any spell with the light descriptor cast on a pound of sunsoil causes all areas covered in the soil to be treated as areas of bright light for 1 round. This light counts as natural sunlight for creatures vulnerable to such effects. After being subjected to such an effect, sunsoil immediately becomes normal dirt."
