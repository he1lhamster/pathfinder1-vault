Title: "Repellent salts"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "100 gp"
Weight: "0.5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This fine alchemical salt has been developed to work against particular types of foes. A batch of repellent salts is attuned to undead or a selected outsider race, such as angels, demons, or devils. As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a dose of repellent salts can be applied to a 5-foot-square area that functions as difficult terrain for the salt's attuned creature type. Any creature can sweep the salts aside as a move action (or as a full-round action for an attuned creature, which deals that creature 2d4 points of acid damage in the process); moderate wind also disperses all repellent salts in a square (including the draft created by a winged creature of at least Medium size that flies within 5 feet of the salts). Alternatively, a vial of repellent salts can be used as a splash weapon against the target creature, with a successful hit dealing 2d4 points of acid damage to the creature struck (or 1 point to an attuned creature within 5 feet of the target and thus exposed to the attack's splash)."

This fine alchemical salt has been developed to work against particular types of foes. A batch of _[[items/Mundane/Repellent salts|repellent salts]]_ is attuned to undead or a selected outsider race, such as angels, demons, or devils. As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a dose of _repellent salts_ can be applied to a 5-foot-square area that functions as difficult terrain for the salt's attuned creature type. Any creature can sweep the salts aside as a move action (or as a full-round action for an attuned creature, which deals that creature 2d4 points of acid damage in the process); moderate wind also disperses all _repellent salts_ in a square (including the draft created by a winged creature of at least _[[classes/Medium|Medium]]_ size that flies within 5 feet of the salts). Alternatively, a _[[items/Mundane/Vial|vial]]_ of _repellent salts_ can be used as a splash weapon against the target creature, with a successful hit dealing 2d4 points of acid damage to the creature struck (or 1 point to an attuned creature within 5 feet of the target and thus exposed to the attack's splash).
