Title: "Display stand"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "40 gp"
Weight: "16 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This is a freestanding rack with several hooks for holding decoratively arranged hunting trophies. A creature with the Grisly Ornament feat (see page 24) can hang one ornament from a display stand, causing it to emanate a fear effect that affects all creatures of that creature's specific variety within 30 feet (DC 15 Will negates). This imposes a –1 penalty (–2 if the trophy creature's CR was 8 or higher) to the same statistic the ornament would otherwise enhance, but the ornament lasts for only 24 hours before decaying. Setting up a stand is a full-round action, while hanging an ornament from one is a move action."
