Title: "Embalming fluid"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "50 gp"
Weight: "10 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This fluid is used to preserve corpses, whether for later dissection, taxidermy, necromancy, or magic such as raise dead. Embalming fluid is technically a poison, and using it makes a corpse unpalatable to most animals and vermin, though corpse-eating undead don't mind the taste. Treating a corpse with embalming fluid takes 1 hour and a successful DC 25 Heal check. The embalmed corpse decays at half the normal rate (each day dead counts as half a day for the purpose of _raise dead_)."
