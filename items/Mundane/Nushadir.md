Title: "Nushadir"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "10 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This reagent is often stored in the form of small, salty pellets in a dry container, though it can also be mixed with a flask of water and carried that way. Nushadir neutralizes acid; a vial of pellets or a flask of nushadir-water is enough to render a cubic foot of acid safe to touch in 1 minute, though this is usually too slow to prevent damage from a thrown vial of acid or the contents of a large monster's gullet. Nushadir vapors are slightly irritating to the eyes, nose, and mouth, causing nausea for 1d4 rounds after close exposure (Fortitude DC 10 negates)."
