  "Used to carry out a private conversation even in a crowded room or public place, this 5-foot-long, 1/2-inch-wide leather hose widens into a copper bell at each end. To use it, one conversation partner holds her end to her ear while her partner speaks into his end, switching their postures for each reply. Conversing through a conversation tube increases the DC of Perception checks to eavesdrop on the conversation by +5 and negates the risk of lipreading but takes twice as long as conversing normally."
