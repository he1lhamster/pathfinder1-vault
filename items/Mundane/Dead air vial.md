Title: "Dead air vial"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "200 gp"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "Within this corked vial is a tiny sample of what is known as "dead air." Heavy, still, and of unknown origin, pockets of dead air becalm airships and smother crews in remote parts of the Plane of Air. When you open a dead air vial, invisible dead air fills a 20-foot-radius area centered on you. The affected area becomes devoid of breathable air. Creatures that breathe air must hold their breath or suffocate in an area of dead air, though sound, fire, and other effects that rely on a stable atmosphere are unaffected. Undisturbed, the dead air dissipates in 1 minute. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the dead air in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the dead air in 1 round. This item can be crafted with a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
