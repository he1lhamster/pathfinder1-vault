Description: |
  "An offset bear trap is a specialized variety of a bear trap constructed with offset jaws coated in resin. It inflicts less damage on captured creatures but holds them more securely, and is therefore primarily used by trappers or bounty hunters who do not want to risk killing their prey. Offset bear traps are almost always secured to the ground by a heavy spike and chain so the captured creature can't wander far.
  A sawtooth bear trap has vicious jaws and tighter springs. Used primarily against humanoids or monsters rather than animals, sawtooth bear traps are often painted in camouflaged colors to blend in with the trap site. Most include locking plates over the spring mechanisms to prevent tampering by intelligent victims.
