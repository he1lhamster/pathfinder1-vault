  "Leshys and other plant creatures have to be wary of hungry herbivorous animals. A dose of animal repellent makes a plant creature smell unappetizing for 24 hours. Animals do not attempt to consume a plant creature coated in animal repellent if there are other food sources available, and in combat prefer to use natural attacks that are not bite attacks against such a creature if they can. Animal repellent counts as a strong scent, allowing creatures with the scent ability to detect it at a greater range (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary_ 304). Animal repellent does not work on ghorans with the delicious racial trait. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
