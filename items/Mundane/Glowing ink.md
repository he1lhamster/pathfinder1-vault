Title: "Glowing ink"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "5 gp"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "Often extracted from phosphorescent insects, tiny marine plants, or subterranean fungi, glowing ink emits a faint but steady light (typically red or green) that allows you to read it in normal darkness—this includes darkness created by spells like _darkness_, but not the supernatural darkness created by _deeper darkness_. If there is glowing ink on an object, you have a +2 bonus on Perception checks to locate it. Mixing glowing ink with marker dye makes the dye glow in the dark until it fades."
