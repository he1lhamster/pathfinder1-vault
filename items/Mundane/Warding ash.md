Type: "Mundane"
Price: "100 gp"
Weight: "0.5 lbs."

Description: |
  "This flaky compound of blessed ashes is steeped in juniper berries, giving it a warm, chestnut color. Unintelligent undead instinctively recoil upon touching warding ash. If an unintelligent undead creature moves into a space covered in warding ash, it must immediately end its movement in that space (Reflex DC 14 negates). A singe dose of warding ash is enough to cover a 5-foot-square space. Applying warding ash is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The warding ash becomes inert 1 minute after being laid, or after the ash is disturbed in any way (such as being stepped on by a creature). Crafting this item requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
