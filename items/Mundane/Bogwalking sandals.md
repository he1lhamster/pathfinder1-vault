Title: "Bogwalking sandals"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "250 gp"
Weight: "0.5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "These sandals have blackwood soles and leather straps that wrap around the wearer's feet. The sandals are waterproof and are thus popular among individuals who tread the harsh locales of the swamps and wastelands beyond Cassomir proper—especially those who are in such environments for long periods of time without access to the comforts of a skilled cobbler. The sandals' design also allows the wearer to move through shallow bogs normally and to treat deep bogs as if they were shallow bogs (_Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook_ 427). The sandals do not affect the penalty on Acrobatics checks while in bogs, and creatures wearing the sandals cannot gain cover from deep bogs."
