Title: "Barding stitches"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "50 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This thin, specially treated wire can be used to attach barding to creatures whose body types cannot normally accommodate armor, such as piscine, serpentine, and verminous animals (see the inside front cover), by delicately and thoroughly sewing the equipment directly to the creature's flesh. Equipping a creature with barding using barding stitches takes 10 times as long as the figures shown on page 153 of the _Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook_, and a successful DC 25 Heal check is required to attach or remove the stitches. The creature must be helpless or willing to be equipped with barding stitches, and must have at least a +1 natural armor bonus to AC. An armored creature with barding stitches takes a -2 penalty on Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks (in addition to any penalties from the barding itself), Fortitude and Reflex saves, and saves against effects with the pain descriptor (these penalties stack). These penalties persist for as long as the creature is equipped with barding stitches."
