Title: "Artokus's fire"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "100 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This congealed incendiary functions like alchemist's fire, but its white-hot flames deal 2d6 points of fire damage on a direct hit and 1d6 points of splash damage to adjacent creatures.
  **Mythic**: You can expend one use of mythic power while throwing a flask of Artokus's fire to cause the substance to burn hotter and longer than normal. A creature struck by a direct hit of Artokus's fire must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or continue to take 1d4 points of fire damage each round at the beginning of its turn. A burning creature can attempt a new save as a full-round action. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the user's mythic tier, and otherwise acts as the burn universal monster rule (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary_ 298). Artokus's fire used in this way burns even underwater, offering no relief to creatures that try to extinguish the fire by dousing or immersing themselves in water."
