Type: "Mundane"
Price: "25 gp"
Weight: "0.5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This small leather pouch is filled with a faintly radioactive ore called caphorite, with a small percentage of reactants that activate the dust. When used, caphorite dust must be sprinkled in a 5-foot square, which then becomes the center of the dust's effect. All bright or normal light within 30 feet of the activated dust is reduced to dim light, and any creature attempting to cast a spell with the light descriptor in this area must succeed at a DC 15 caster level check or have spell's effect be negated. If caphorite is exposed to sunlight, it immediately becomes permanently inert. Each pouch contains enough dust for two applications. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
