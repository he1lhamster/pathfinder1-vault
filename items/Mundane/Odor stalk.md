Title: "Odor stalk"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "70 gp"
Weight: "0.1 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "These alchemically treated incense sticks contain pheromones that certain creatures find repellent. Each odor stalk is created to irritate a specific creature type. After burning for 1 round, an odor stalk fills a 10–foot square with a clear gas that causes any living creature of the prescribed type to become nauseated for 1 round, then sickened for as long as it remains in the area. On a successful DC 12 Fortitude save, the creature negates the nauseated condition but not the sickened condition. This is a poison effect. The cloud lasts for 10 minutes, but can be dispersed like _obscuring mist_. Additionally, odor stalks can be used as an additional spell component for the following spells to modify the spell's effects.
  _Ghoul touch_: The stench only affects creatures of the odor stalk's associated creature type.
  _Repel vermin_: The spell functions as written, but applies to the odor stalk's associated creature type instead of to vermin. The Will save DC is always 12 when using this component.
  _Stinking cloud_: The Fortitude save DC increases by 1 for creatures of the odor stalk's prescribed type, but decreases by 1 for all other creature types."
