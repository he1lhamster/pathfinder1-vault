Title: "Cooking powder"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "2 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "By boiling certain seeds with handfuls of rust, halfling alchemists create these red flakes, which smolder slowly when touched by a spark or flame. If sprinkled over food and lit, a handful of cooking powder can cook meat or vegetables in 20 minutes without light or significant heat, though it lends a metallic flavor to any foods. If held to a living creature's flesh, smoldering cooking powder deals 1 point of fire damage per minute for 20 minutes. One jar of cooking powder is enough to cook up to 5 pounds of food in 1-pound increments. Crafting a jar of cooking powder requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check."
