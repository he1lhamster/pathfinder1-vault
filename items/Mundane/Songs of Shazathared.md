Title: "Songs of Shazathared"
Type: "Mundane"
Price: "11000 gp"
Weight: "4 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "Nearly 50 ancient tales and songs have been collected on this long scroll. Contrasting with the obvious antiquity of the papyrus, the illuminated images are vivid and the writing is clear (though occasionally difficult to decipher due to elaborate embellishments), as the inks used were infused with _unguent of timelessness_.
  This folio is the most complete extant collection of poems by the legendary marid bard Shazathared. Most of the poems recount the binding of Rovagug by the gods and the fates of his terrible spawn, but several pieces, told from the point of view of a genie princess, speak of defending the princess's home and allies against bandit-kings, tempests, and evil magic. A bard with access to a complete copy of these poems can learn the defensive songs in the folio as the masterpiece presented below by paying the normal masterpiece cost (_Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic_ 21)."
