Description: |
  "Others lacking the will to harden themselves appropriately turn to alchemical methods to endure. This purplish paste is made from sea urchin toxins and numbs the user's ability to sense pain. Illegal in Nidal, the drug is used mostly by those attempting to emulate true belief in Zon-Kuthon or who anticipate great pain. A dose gives the user the Endure Pain feat for 1 hour, though it also has debilitating side effects and leaves telltale reddish-purple stains around the nostrils for up to one day, easily identified by those familiar with the symptoms. Followers of the Midnight Lord believe using heathensnuff is a sure sign that an individual lacks faith.
  Anyone who takes the drug must make a DC 10 saving throw or become addicted. A snuff addict can stave off withdrawal for 5 days by taking a dose; failure means he must save or take 1d4 Dex and 1d4 Wis damage. This save DC increases by +5 for every 5 days since the last time the addict had a dose. If the addict makes two of these saves in a row, he is no longer addicted. _Remove disease_ can cure an addict if the caster's caster level check succeeds against a DC equal to the addict's current withdrawal DC. _Greater restoration_ or heal cures the addiction without requiring a roll.
  **Type** poison, ingested; **Save** Fortitude DC 13
  **Frequency** 1/hour for 4 hours
  **Initial Effect** Endure Pain feat for 1 hour (see above);
