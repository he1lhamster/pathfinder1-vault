Description: |
  "These strange books are fashioned from a metallic alloy, the crafting of which is known only to yithians and a very few others. Supposedly taken from the same collection as the fabled _Pnakotic Manuscripts_ and traded throughout the multiverse, these books are collections of notes recorded by visitors to the yithians' cities. Each book is written in multiple languages and provides a vast array of information on a specifc topic, but the information it contains is often oddly specifc and lacks context. A single Pnakotic record focuses on a single subject within the confnes of a single Knowledge skill, such as a presentation on the nature of deep one religious practices in worshiping Cthulhu (Knowledge [religion]), the mechanics of a shoggoth's biology (Knowledge [dungeoneering]), or the methods of creating portals between worlds (Knowledge [arcana]). By studying a Pnakotic record for 8 hours, a reader can attempt a single Knowledge check of the appropriate type when researching the book's corresponding subject to gain a +10 circumstance bonus on the check."
