  "One end of this short length of petrified wood burns with a flame of ever-changing hue, a tiny portion of the fires of the Founder's Flame (_Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Magnimar, City of Monuments_ 32). It provides light as per a normal torch but is not consumed, and its fire cannot be extinguished by mundane means (though total immersion temporarily quenches the flame).
