  "A perfume kit consists of an atomizer and a diverse array of perfumes, scented oils, wild flowers, and herbs. Applying scents from a perfume kit takes 1 minute, and grants you a +1 circumstance bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Handle Animal, Intimidate, or Perform checks, subject to GM discretion. You must choose the type of check when you apply the fragrances. This bonus typically doesn't apply in combat or against hostile creatures, and might not work on creatures without olfactory senses or who would be more offended than entranced by your scent. The bonus lasts for 4 hours. You can gain only one bonus from a perfume kit at a time, and the bonus from perfume does not stack with bonuses from any masterwork tools you possess for the same skill. A perfume kit is exhausted after 10 uses."
