Title: "Bolas bolts"
Type: "Ammunition"
Price: "20 gp"
Weight: "4 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "Bolas bolts are bolas-like projectiles used as ammunition for slaver's crossbows. If you hit a target with a bolas bolt fired from a slaver's crossbow, attempt a trip combat maneuver against your target (don't add your Strength bonus when attempting the combat maneuver check). You can't be tripped during your own trip attempt when using a bolas bolt.
  On a critical hit, instead of dealing extra damage, the bolas bolt ensnares its target. Your target is entangled until it or an ally succeeds at a DC 15 Strength check to break the bolas cords. A light slaver's crossbow can entangle a target up to the same size as its intended wielder, and a heavy slaver's crossbow can entangle a creature up to one size larger. A masterwork bolas bolt or one with an enhancement bonus of at least +1 increases the DC of the Strength check to break the bolas to 20.
  If the attack trips and entangles a target, the creature cannot move from its square until it breaks free of the bolas cords."

A masterwork _bolas_ bolt or one with an enhancement bonus of at least +1 increases the DC of the Strength check to break the _bolas_ to 20.

If the attack trips and entangles a target, the creature cannot move from its square until it breaks free of the _bolas_ cords.
