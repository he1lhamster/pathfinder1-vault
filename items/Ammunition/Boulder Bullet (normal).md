Weight: "0.5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "14"
Aura: "strong enchantment"
Description: |
  "A _boulder bullet_ appears to be a magical sling bullet when held, but it is actually a shrunken piece of catapult ammunition. A _boulder bullet_ expands rapidly when launched from a sling or sling staff, increasing in size and dealing greater base damage depending on the version used. This doesn't affect the bullet's range or any of the normal mechanics for using a sling bullet, though the _boulder bullet_ is treated as siege weapon ammunition for the purposes of wind effects and similar penalties. Similarly, if a _boulder bullet_ is launched and misses its target, roll 1d8 to determine the adjacent square in which it lands. Once it has been thrown and has expanded, a boulder bullet loses its magic and remains boulder-sized thereafter.
  _Lesser Boulder Bullet (CL 10th)_: A _lesser boulder bullet_ is a _+1 sling bullet_ that expands to the size of light catapult ammunition, increasing its base damage to 4d6.
  _Boulder Bullet (CL 14th)_: A _boulder bullet_ is a _+2 sling bullet_ that expands to the size of standard catapult ammunition, increasing its base damage to 6d6.
  _Greater Boulder Bullet (CL 18th)_: A _greater boulder bullet_ is a _+3 sling bullet_ that expands to the size of heavy catapult ammunition, increasing its base damage to 8d6."
