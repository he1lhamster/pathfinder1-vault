Description: |
  "The steel head of this masterwork arrow is sculpted to look like a leering mephit. If a _mephit-head arrow_ hits, it sprays elemental energy in a 15-foot cone that must originate from the target creature (including the creature struck) and expand in the direction the arrow was fired. The damage dealt depends on the type of _mephit-head arrow_, as detailed below. A successful DC 13 Reflex save halves the cone's damage and negates any additional effect.
  **Air Mephit**: A blast of wind-borne grit deals 1d8 points of slashing damage.
  **Dust or Salt Mephit**: A spray of fine grit or coarse salt crystals deals 1d4 points of slashing damage and sickens targets in the cone for 3 rounds.
  **Earth Mephit**: A shower of gravel deals 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage.
  **Fire or Magma Mephit**: A cone of flames or spray of magma deals 1d8 points of fire damage.
  **Ice Mephit**: Shards of ice deal 1d4 points of cold damage and sicken targets in the cone for 3 rounds.
  **Ooze Mephit**: A wave of slime deals 1d4 points of acid damage and sickens targets in the cone for 3 rounds.
  **Steam Mephit**: A plume of steam deals 1d4 points of fire damage and sickens targets in the cone for 3 rounds.
  **Water Mephit**: A spray of acid deals 1d8 points of acid damage."
