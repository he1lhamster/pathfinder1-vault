Title: "Weighted bolt"
Type: "Ammunition"
Price: "50 gp"
Weight: "40 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This barbed ballista bolt is equipped with a heavy weight at the end of a long chain. The bolt's extra weight makes the bolt harder to fire accurately, and imposes a –2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition to the normal damage dealt by a ballista bolt of its size, on a successful hit the weighted bolt lodges itself into the target's body, leaving the weighted chain hanging loosely, imparting a –5 penalty on all Fly checks made by the target. These penalties stack if a target is hit with multiple weighted bolts. A weighted bolt can be removed with a successful DC 25 Heal check or a DC 20 Strength check."
