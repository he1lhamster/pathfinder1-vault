Description: |
  "This animated wood and metal snake squirms and hisses when handled, attempting to bite its holder just as a real snake might. To use the _snakebiter arrow_ as a projectile, the bearer must first succeed at a DC 10 Handle Animal or wild empathy check to get the snake to shape itself into a _+1 seeking arrow_ or a _+1 seeking bolt_ (this is considered a trick known by the snake) for 1 minute. Failure means the snake attacks the bearer for 1 round, using the statistics of a Tiny viper familiar (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary_ 133). A target struck by the projectile must succeed at a saving throw or be affected by a powerful variant black adder venom (Fortitude DC 20). Normally, these items are carried in a pouch rather than a quiver to prevent them from getting loose."
