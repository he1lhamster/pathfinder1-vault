A _phase arrow_ ignores cover of all kinds, including total cover, and can be fired at a target even if the wielder doesn't have line of effect. However, if the wielder cannot see or otherwise pinpoint the target, she risks attacking the wrong space, and even if she attacks the right space, the target still has total concealment against the attack (granting a 50% miss chance)."
