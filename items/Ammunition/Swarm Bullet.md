  "This small brass cylinder is inscribed with a symbol of a honeycomb, and a faint buzzing sound can be heard from within. A _swarm bullet_ can be loaded into a weapon with the scatter weapon quality, such as a blunderbuss, as though it were ammunition. When fired, the weapon produces a wasp swarm that immediately moves to attack the nearest living target in a 15-foot cone. The wasp swarm acts on the shooter's turn each round, pursuing the closest living creature for 3 rounds or until it's destroyed. Should the weapon misfire while loaded with a _swarm bullet_, the swarm instead angrily emerges from the weapon and pursues the wielder."
