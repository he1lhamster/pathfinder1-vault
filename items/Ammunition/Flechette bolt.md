Title: "Flechette bolt"
Type: "Ammunition"
Price: "30 gp"
Weight: "20 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Description: |
  "This ballista bolt consists of dozens of small steel darts, called flechettes, which break away after the bolt is released. If the bolt impacts anything before it reaches a distance of 30 feet, it deals 1d8 points of damage. Between 30 and 60 feet away, the flechettes deploy, dealing piercing damage to every creature and object within a 30-foot-cone burst. After 60 feet, the flechettes lose momentum and fall harmlessly to the ground.
  Separate attack rolls must be made against each target hit by the burst. Light ballista flechettes deal 2d8 points of damage, while heavy ballista flechettes deal 3d8 points. Additionally, any winged creature hit by flechettes has several holes punched in its wings, and has its fly speed reduced by 10 feet. The creature takes a –4 penalty on Fly checks until the damage is healed."
