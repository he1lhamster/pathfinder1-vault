Description: |
  "These arrows are tightly wrapped in strands of alchemical glue. Durable arrows don't break with normal use, whether or not they hit their target; unless a durable arrow goes missing, an archer can retrieve and reuse it again and again. Durable arrows can be broken in other ways (such as deliberate snapping, hitting a fire elemental, and so on). A magical durable arrow with an enhancement bonus or magic weapon special ability applies these magical effects only the first time it is used—afterward, the durable arrow becomes nonmagical, and it can be reused or imbued with magic again."
