  "A _shocking burst _weapon functions as a shock weapon that explodes with electricity upon striking a successful critical hit. The electricity does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra electricity damage from the shock ability, a _shocking burst _weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of electricity damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon’s critical multiplier is ×3, add an extra 2d10 points of electricity damage instead, and if the multiplier is ×4, add an extra 3d10 points.
