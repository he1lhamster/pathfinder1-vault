  "A _brilliant energy _weapon has its significant portion transformed into light, although this does not modify the item’s weight. It always gives off light as a torch (20- foot radius). A _brilliant energy _weapon ignores nonliving matter. Armor and shield bonuses to AC (including any enhancement bonuses to that armor) do not count against it because the weapon passes through armor. (Dexterity, deflection, dodge, natural armor, and other such bonuses still apply.) A _brilliant energy _weapon cannot harm undead, constructs, or objects."
