  "Weapons with this special ability cause foes struck by them to have exceptional difficulty controlling their magic. Any time a creature that has been struck by a _greater distracting_ weapon would have to succeed at a concentration check to complete a spell or use a special ability or item, the DC of that check increases by 10. This distraction lasts for 1 minute. Once a _greater distracting _weapon affects a creature in this way, that creature can’t be affected by a _distracting _or _greater distracting _effect for 24 hours. If a _greater distracting _weapon is used on a creature already affected by a _distracting _weapon’s effect, the two effects do not stack; the _distracting _effect ends, and the creature is affected by the _greater distracting _weapon’s effect instead."
