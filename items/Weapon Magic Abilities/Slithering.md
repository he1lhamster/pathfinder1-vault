  "This special ability can be placed only on a melee weapon. A _slithering _weapon can bend and flex when swung at a target, allowing it to fit through narrow gaps and around difficult angles with greater ease and making the weapon difficult to strike. When a _slithering _weapon is used to attack a creature with cover, the target’s cover bonus to Armor Class is halved. In addition, the wielder adds the weapon’s enhancement bonus to her CMD against attempts to disarm or sunder her _slithering_ weapon. If the wielder is squeezing in a narrow space, she takes only half the normal penalty on attack rolls with her _slithering _weapon."
