  "A _greater transformative_ weapon becomes any other weapon the wielder desires when a command word is spoken. The weapon cannot become ammunition, but can freely change between simple, martial, exotic, light, one-handed, twohanded, melee, and ranged. The weapon retains all of its enhancement bonuses and weapon special abilities. However, abilities prohibited by its current shape do not function. For example, a _keen greater transformative_ weapon functions normally in the form of a piercing or slashing weapon, but cannot use the _keen_ special ability when in the shape of a bludgeoning weapon. A double weapon that loses the double quality cannot use the abilities on one of its ends (wielder’s choice), whereas a non-double weapon that gains the double quality applies all its abilities to only one end. When unattended for 1 day, the weapon reverts to its true shape."
