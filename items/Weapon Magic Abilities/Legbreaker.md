  "A _legbreaker _weapon reduces the base land speed of a struck creature by 10 feet for 1d4 rounds. Multiple hits from a _legbreaker _weapon do not reduce a creature’s land speed further, but they do extend the duration of the penalty. This speed penalty can be removed with a successful DC 15 Heal check. On a critical hit, in addition dealing critical damage and impeding the victim’s speed, the wielder may perform a free trip combat maneuver against the struck creature. This ability can only be placed on bludgeoning melee weapons."
