  "This special ability can be placed only on a melee weapon. A _truthful _weapon unerringly pierces concealment provided by illusions, allowing the wielder to ignore the miss chance provided by illusions such as _blur, displacement_, and _invisibility_. Attacks with a _truthful _weapon against a creature affected by _mirror image _or a similar figment always attack the real target. This ability allows the wielder to ignore the miss chance, not to otherwise detect the target. When attacking an invisible creature, for instance, the wielder might still need to guess the target’s location.
 In addition to its other abilities, a _truthful _weapon functions as a special kind of _dispellingUE_ weapon against figments and shadow conjuration effects; if the wielder makes an attack against such an effect, the weapon automatically attempts to use the stored _dispel magic_ against the illusion. If the attempt fails, the wielder is not aware of the attempt, and unless she disbelieves the illusion or the illusion’s duration ends, the weapon continues to impart that it is storing _dispel magic_ (though she is free to cast _dispel magic _on the weapon again if she has another reason to believe the effect was expended and failed to dispel an illusion)."

This special ability can be placed only on a melee weapon. A _truthful _weapon unerringly pierces concealment provided by illusions, allowing the wielder to ignore the miss chance provided by illusions such as _blur, displacement_, and _invisibility_. Attacks with a _truthful _weapon against a creature affected by _mirror image _or a similar figment always attack the real target. This ability allows the wielder to ignore the miss chance, not to otherwise detect the target. When attacking an invisible creature, for instance, the wielder might still need to guess the target’s location.
