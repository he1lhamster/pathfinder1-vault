  "Typically forged by aeons or other creatures that eschew commonly held structures of morality, _unaligned_ weapons quell the effects of extreme alignments on the wielder. The wielder counts her Hit Dice as 4 lower than her actual total HD when someone attempts to detect her alignment using _detect chaos_, _detect evil_, _detect good_, _detect law_, or similar spells or effects. Furthermore, if the wielder is an outsider and is targeted by a spell or effect with an alignment descriptor that deals additional damage to or has an additional effect on outsiders (such as _holy smite_), she adds a bonus equal to the unaligned weapon’s enhancement bonus on saving throws she attempts against that spell or effect. Finally, the wielder takes no penalties on her Charisma-, Intelligence-, or Wisdom-based checks from a plane’s mildly aligned or strongly aligned traits, regardless of her actual alignment."

### Description

Typically forged by aeons or other creatures that eschew commonly held structures of morality, _unaligned_ weapons quell the effects of extreme alignments on the wielder. The wielder counts her Hit Dice as 4 lower than her actual total HD when someone attempts to detect her alignment using _detect chaos_, _detect evil_, _detect good_, _detect law_, or similar spells or effects. Furthermore, if the wielder is an outsider and is targeted by a spell or effect with an alignment descriptor that deals additional damage to or has an additional effect on outsiders (such as _holy smite_), she adds a bonus equal to the unaligned weapon’s enhancement bonus on saving throws she attempts against that spell or effect. Finally, the wielder takes no penalties on her Charisma-, Intelligence-, or Wisdom-based checks from a plane’s mildly aligned or strongly aligned traits, regardless of her actual alignment.

### Construction
