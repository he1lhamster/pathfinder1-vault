  "An _icy burst _weapon functions as a _frost _weapon that also explodes with frost upon striking a successful critical hit. The frost does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra damage from the _frost _ability, an _icy burst _weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of cold damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon’s critical multiplier is ×3, add an extra 2d10 points of cold damage instead, and if the multiplier is ×4, add an extra 3d10 points.
