  "This special ability can be placed only on one-handed or light piercing melee weapons. A _flamboyant _weapon has its own magical reservoir of panache that its wielder can spend to use her deeds. Usually this panache is stored within a jewel or other adornment. This reservoir holds 1 panache point, which is refreshed at the start of each day.
 Whether or not the wielder of a _flamboyant _weapon has any deeds, she can always spend 1 panache point from the _flamboyant _weapon to reroll an attack made with it that missed due to rolling a natural 1. When the wielder does so, she must take the second result, even if it also misses."
