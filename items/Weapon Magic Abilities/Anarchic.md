It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all creatures of lawful alignment. It bestows one permanent negative level (_Core Rulebook _562) on any lawful creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded.
