  "A _shattering _weapon functions as a _breaking _weapon that also explodes with a resounding crash upon striking a successful critical hit. In addition to the extra damage from the _breaking_ ability, a _shattering _weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of damage to objects and crystalline creatures on a successful critical hit. If the weapon’s critical multiplier is ×3, it deals an extra 2d10 points of damage instead, and if the multiplier is ×4, it deals an extra 3d10 points instead. When used against a crystalline creature, this damage stacks with _bane _and similar weapon special abilities (though the damage from the _breaking _ability still doesn’t).
 Even if the _breaking _ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra damage on a successful critical hit. A _shattering _weapon ignores the hardness of objects with a hardness of 10 or lower."
