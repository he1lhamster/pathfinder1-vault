  "This ability can be placed only on a _corrosive _or _corrosive burst _weapon (_Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment_ 138). When the wielder of a _catalytic _weapon hits a creature, the weapon triggers a devastating chemical reaction that burns the struck creature. The creature struck must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save, or take 1d6 points of acid damage at the start of its turn for 1d4 rounds. Successive hits with the _catalytic _weapon increase the duration but don’t add to the damage. The creature can attempt to neutralize the reaction as a full-round action as if it were on fire (including bonuses for dropping and rolling on the ground or jumping into water). Anyone who hits a creature subject to this chemical reaction with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of acid damage."
