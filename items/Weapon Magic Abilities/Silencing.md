  "A _silencing _weapon makes no noise when drawn or when used to attack. In addition, after hitting a creature, the wielder can surround that creature with an aura that muffles all sounds coming from it until the beginning of the wielder’s next turn. The target can still hear and speak (including uttering command words or casting spells with verbal components), but is much harder to hear. The DC of Perception checks to hear the sound of battle increases from –10 to 10, as long as the only combatants are the wielder of the _silencing _weapon and targets affected by the weapon’s muffling ability.
 If the wielder confirms a critical hit with a _silencing_ weapon, the target is also encased in a mobile aura of magical _silence_ (Will DC 13 negates), which lasts a number of rounds equal to the critical multiplier of the weapon. The save DC increases by 2 for each critical multiplier of the weapon higher than ×2. This _silence_ fills the target’s space but doesn’t extend beyond it."
