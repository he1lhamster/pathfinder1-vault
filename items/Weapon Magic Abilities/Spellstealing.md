  "This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A _spellstealing _weapon allows its wielder to siphon protective magic from a target and transfer it to herself. When the wielder rolls a critical threat against a target, she can forgo confirming the critical hit and instead automatically learn which spells or magical effects are active upon the target. The wielder may then make a caster level check to steal her choice of one of those effects, using the _spellstealing_ weapon’s caster level plus its enhancement bonus, against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the effect. If the check succeeds, the target immediately loses the benefits of that effect and the wielder gains the effect for 1 minute (or until the effect expires, whichever comes first). If the _spellstealing _weapon has a critical multiplier greater than ×2, the wielder may attempt to steal one additional spell effect per additional multiple beyond ×2 (two effects for ×3, and so on)."
