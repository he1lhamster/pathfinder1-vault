  "A _burning_ weapon causes an unattended flammable object to ignite when struck (Fortitude DC 13 negates for magic items), dealing 1d6+1 points of fire damage to the object each round after it’s ignited. An item made mostly or entirely out of wood is even more susceptible to this effect, taking 2d6+2 points of fire damage. This effect lasts for 1d4 rounds. A creature that ends its turn in the same space as a burning object takes 1d6+1 points of fire damage.
 Up to three times per day, the bearer of a _burning _weapon can, on command, cause a single object that has been ignited by the weapon to burn even brighter, increasing the duration of its burning effect by 1d4+1 rounds and causing the fire to expand in a burst that extends 5 feet from the object. This burst of fire deals 1d6+1 points of fire damage to each creature in that area, and it can ignite unattended flammable objects within that area as if they had been hit with the weapon.
 Fire giants often make use of _burning _weapons in their fervid crusades against other races."
