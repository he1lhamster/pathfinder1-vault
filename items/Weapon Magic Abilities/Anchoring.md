  "This special ability can only be added to a melee weapon or a thrown weapon. An _anchoring _weapon pins a target in place and prevents it from moving. As a swift action, the weapon can be fixed in place in a point in space, functioning as an _immovable rod_. This ability can also be used when the wielder hits a creature with a melee attack using an _anchoring _weapon. This anchors the target to the weapon, preventing it from moving away from the weapon. The target is not entangled or paralyzed; it simply cannot move from its location without first destroying the weapon or making a successful DC 30 Strength check as a full-round action to move with the weapon up to 10 feet. An _anchoring _weapon remains motionless and cannot be used to attack while it is anchoring a creature. An _anchoring_ weapon has no effect on amorphous creatures, including elementals, oozes, and creatures in gaseous or liquid form. It also cannot anchor incorporeal creatures unless the weapon also has the _ghost touch _special ability."
