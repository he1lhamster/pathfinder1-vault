  "A _spirit-hunting_ weapon excels against enemies with either the mystery or spirit class feature (but has no effect against a shaman who has a temporary bond to the appropriate spirit by way of the wandering spirit class feature or similar effect). Against a designated foe, the weapon’s enhancement bonus is 2 better than its actual bonus. It also deals 2d6 additional points of damage against such foes. When combined with abilities like _bane _or _blood-hunting_, the enhancement bonus increases granted by these abilities do not stack, but an additional 1d6 points of damage are added to the additional damage for each special ability beyond the first.
