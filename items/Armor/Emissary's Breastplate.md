Description: |
  "When not being worn, this simple steel _+1 breastplate_ appears to be typical magic armor. When worn by a cavalier with the banner class feature, an _emissary's breastplate_ automatically displays the cavalier's heraldry and counts as his banner. As long as the cavalier is not in disguise, he is considered to be displaying his banner while wearing the armor. Additionally, the wearer can expend a use of his challenge ability to speak on behalf of himself, his lord, or other agent who has given him the authority to do so. This allows him to use _tongues_ (as per the spell) and issue a single _command_ (as per the spell)."
