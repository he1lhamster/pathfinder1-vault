Description: |
  "This gold-plated _+1 mithral full plate armor_ has images of Iomedae's symbol etched into its immaculately gleaming surface. The armor requires 24 hours to attune itself to the wearer and her patron deity, after which point the images on the armor shift to match the symbol of the wearer's patron deity (or remain associated with Iomedae if the wearer doesn't worship a deity). Thereafter, once per day the armor's wearer can offer a prayer to her deity (or Iomedae) as a swift action to increase the armor's enhancement bonus to +2 for 10 rounds. For this duration, the armor also grants a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws. A paladin wearing _armor of the pious_ can use her lay on hands ability one additional time per day; a mythic paladin wearing _armor of the pious_ also gains one additional use of mythic power per day. An evil character who wears _armor of the pious_ gains 2 negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the armor is worn and disappear when the armor is removed—they never become permanent but can't be overcome in any way as long as the armor is worn."
