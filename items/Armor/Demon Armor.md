Description: |
  "This plate armor is fashioned to make the wearer appear to be a demon. Glowing red energy emanates from sigils engraved on the armor's key plates and joints, and the runes intermittently surge with fiendish power. This _+4 full plate_ allows the wearer to make claw attacks that deal 1d10 points of damage, strike as +1 weapons, and afflict the target as if she had been struck by a _contagion_ spell (Fortitude DC 14 negates). Use of _contagion_ requires a normal melee attack with the claws. The "claws" are built into the armor's vambraces and gauntlets, and cannot be disarmed.
  A suit of _demon armor_ is infused with evil, and as a result it bestows one negative level on any nonevil creature wearing it. This negative level persists as long as the armor is worn and disappears when the armor is removed. The negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the armor is worn."
