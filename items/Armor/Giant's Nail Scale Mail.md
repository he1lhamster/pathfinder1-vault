Description: |
  "This thick coat of _+2 scale mail_ is crafted from waxy scales of varying sizes with a sickly, jaundiced color—the grime-stained fingernails of dead hill giants. Any creature of the giant subtype who comes within 30 feet of _giant's nail scale mail_ must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or take a –4 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws for 1d4 rounds. This ability functions as a gaze effect. It is a mind-affecting fear effect, but it does not stack with other fear effects to create stronger fear conditions. A giant who succeeds at the saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours. If a giant rolls a natural 20 on its saving throw, it becomes enraged by the sight of the armor. The giant gains the effects of the _rage_ spell for 1d4 rounds and is compelled to attack the armor's wearer for the duration of this effect."
