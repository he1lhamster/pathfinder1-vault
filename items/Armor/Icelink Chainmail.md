  "Carved from a single block of ice birthed from the breath of the great white wyrm Sjohvor, the ice-carved rings of this exquisite suit of _+2 chainmail_ never thaw.

The armor then glows with a pale blue radiance, deals 4d6 points of cold damage to the target, and causes the target to be staggered for 1 round. Once the armor discharges, this ability can't be used until the armor recharges 1 hour later.
  _Icelink chainmail_ is considered light armor and has an arcane spell failure chance of 20%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +4, and an armor check penalty of –3. The armor weighs half as much as standard chainmail and floats in water."
