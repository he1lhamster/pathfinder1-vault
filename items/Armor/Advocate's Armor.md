Description: |
  "The papery layers of this robe barely constitute what would be traditionally called armor, yet act as _+3 leather armor_. Once per day, when the wearer is struck by a critical hit or sneak attack, he can choose to have his blood splatter across one of the paper layers and form the words of a binding deal between the attacker and the wearer. The wearer can put the opponent under a specific restriction for 24 hours, such as "I will not attack elves," or "I will attack only those who attacked me first." The terms of the contract must be simple enough for the creature to comprehend and spoken in a language it understands. This acts as a lesser geas spell, except without a limit to how many Hit Dice the target can have. A successful DC 19 Will save negates this effect."
