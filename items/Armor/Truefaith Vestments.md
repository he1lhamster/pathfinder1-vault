Description: |
  "Worn by enforcers and acolytes of the living god Razmir, this _+1 chain shirt_ appears as a fine hooded robe made of silk of a color appropriate to the wearer's rank within the church as if it had the _glamered_ special ability (it appears white when worn by anyone who doesn't follow Razmir). Used primarily as a means of appearing to be protected by the false god's power, the armor is treated as a _+3 breastplate_ against attacks made by any enemy who has not seen through the illusion. Unlike with standard _glamered armor_, any creature that successfully hits the target with a melee weapon is considered to have interacted with the illusion, and can see the armor's true form with a successful DC 16 Will save."
