  "The following suit of armor is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.
  Spikes of impractical length adorn this _+1 spiked breastplate_. The armor's enhancement bonus applies on attack rolls and damage rolls for attacks made with the armor spikes, as well as to its armor bonus to AC.
  As a full-round action, the wearer can claim a trophy from a slain foe and mount it on the armor's spikes, gaining a +1 competence bonus on Intimidate checks and a +1 morale bonus on Will saves against fear. Each additional trophy mounted on the armor's spikes increases these bonuses by 1. As an immediate action before rolling to confirm a critical hit, the wearer can call upon the armor to gain a morale bonus on the attack roll to confirm the critical hit equal to the total number of trophies on the armor. Doing so consumes one of the trophies.
  The armor can hold up to four trophies. To provide any benefit, trophies must be from creatures that were slain by the wearer and whose Hit Dice were equal to at least half of the wearer's total Hit Dice. The armor's magic keeps the trophies from rotting away completely, but does nothing to keep them fresh or hide the stench of rotting flesh.
  Suits of _armor of grim triumph_ find use mainly among the orcs of Belkzen and the Darklands. In the Mwangi Expanse, orcs use the similar _hide of grim triumph_, which is _+1 spiked hide armor_ crafted from tanned animal hides and foot-long thorns. Reduce the cost and price of a _hide of grim triumph_ by 185 gp and the weight by 10 pounds."
