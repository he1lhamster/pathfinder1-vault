Description: |
  "This suit of _+2 field plate_ is composed of durable plates of steel layered over an intricate framework of gears, springs, and pistons that move with mechanical precision. A suit of _clockwork armor_ requires a special winding key to function; this key is created as part of making a suit of _clockwork armor_.
  In order to function, a suit of _clockwork armor_ must be fully wound as a full-round action. Once fully wound, a suit of _clockwork armor_ functions for 4 hours. If a suit of clockwork armor is not fully wound, its gears grind to a halt and it imposes double its normal armor check penalty and a –2 penalty to its wearer's Strength and Dexterity scores. Donning or removing a suit of unwound _clockwork armor_ requires 10 minutes.
  When fully wound, a suit of _clockwork armor_ can be donned or removed as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. It grants the wearer a +4 temporary enhancement bonus to Strength and Constitution, and its weight does not count against the wearer's total encumbrance. A single crossbow or firearm sized appropriately for the wearer can be added to the armor with a successful DC 20 Craft (armorer) check. Such a weapon can be fired once as a standard action by the wearer, then automatically reloads itself in 2d4 rounds, as long as the wearer has the appropriate ammunition in his gear."
