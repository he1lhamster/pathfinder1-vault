Description: |
  "With the coming of the Eye of Abendego and the permanent change to the coastline's environs, its inhabitants have been forced to look to strange new places for resources. Hagfish hide may well be one of the most unusual replacement materials. This suit of _+1 slick hide armor_ appears to constantly drip a viscous ooze. When immersed in water, the wearer gains a swim speed of 20 feet and the ability to breathe underwater. The slime exuded by the armor is particularly unpleasant and foul-tasting—the first time a creature successfully bites a character wearing _hide of the hagfish_ in a 24 hour period, that creature must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw to avoid being nauseated by the slime for 1 round."
