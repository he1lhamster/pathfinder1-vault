Description: |
  "This suit of _+1 spiked half-plate armor_ is crafted from the hide and carapace of a xill (_Bestiary_ 283) and includes a xill-skull helmet complete with insectlike mandibles, giving the wearer an otherworldly, buglike appearance. Once per day, the wearer can shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane and back again, as the _etherealness_ magic armor special ability. Unlike with standard _etherealness_ armor, however, the transitions to and from planes function exactly like a xill's planewalk ability, save that the wearer cannot take any creatures with it when it switches planes.
  Additionally, the spikes along the armor's back, torso, arms, and upper legs are laced with a natural paralytic. The target of a successful critical hit made with these armor spikes is paralyzed for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude DC 16 negates)."
