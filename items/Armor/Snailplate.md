  "This breastplate made from the shell of a flail snail functions as a _+1 reflecting breastplate_ (even though that shield property cannot normally be added to armor). Once per day, the wearer can cause a spell targeted at him to reflect back at the caster, exactly like _spell turning_. At the GM's discretion, the wearer can instead expend this one use per day to roll on the flail snail's chart, randomly warping the spell in question."
