Description: |
  "The _barding of pleated light_ was crafted by angels in service to Pulura, the Shimmering Maiden, an empyreal lord once venerated by the conquered people of Sarkoris. This ornately crafted mithral full plate armor resizes to fit a horse, warhorse, or equivalent mount that it is placed upon. It acts as _+2 greater spell resistance (19) full plate barding_. The _barding of pleated light_ grants additional powers related to the rippling light of an aurora. These powers can be activated by the wearer's rider; the wearer can activate the barding's powers only if it has an Intelligence score of 3 or greater.
  First, the barding can be activated as the _blinding_ shield special ability at will, but the wearer and the wearer's rider are both immune to this blinding effect. Second, as an immediate action, the armor can be activated to divert harmful light or shadows. This grants the armor's spell resistance to the wearer's rider for 1 round, but this spell resistance only protects against spells with the light or shadow descriptor. Finally, the armor allows the wearer to pass through shimmering curtains of light. As an immediate action when charging, the armor can be activated to select any 10-foot-square area in the path of the charge. A curtain of multicolored light appears momentarily on each side of this area. The wearer can charge across this area as though it did not exist, disappearing into a ripple of light on one side and reappearing in a ripple of light on the other side. The wearer ignores terrain or obstacles in the intervening area (allowing the wearer to charge through allies in the area, for example), and the intervening area does not count toward the wearer's charge movement. The ripple of light cannot be used for movement by anyone except the wearer and the wearer's rider."
Destruction: |
  "The _barding of pleated light_ is destroyed if it's reduced to 0 hit points in an area of absolute darkness with no light—not even a candle's flicker or reflected moonbeam—within 10 miles in any direction."

### Description

The _[[items/Armor/Barding of Pleated Light|barding of pleated light]]_ was crafted by angels in service to Pulura, the Shimmering Maiden, an empyreal lord once venerated by the conquered people of Sarkoris. This ornately crafted mithral _[[items/Armor/Full plate|full plate]]_ armor resizes to fit a _[[monsters/Horse|horse]]_, warhorse, or equivalent _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_ that it is placed upon. It acts as +2 greater _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ (19) _full plate_ barding. The _barding of pleated light_ grants additional powers related to the rippling light of an aurora. These powers can be activated by the wearer's rider; the wearer can activate the barding's powers only if it has an Intelligence score of 3 or greater.

First, the barding can be activated as the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Blinding|blinding]]_ _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_ special ability at will, but the wearer and the wearer's rider are both immune to this _blinding_ effect. Second, as an immediate action, the armor can be activated to divert harmful light or shadows. This grants the armor's _spell resistance_ to the wearer's rider for 1 round, but this _spell resistance_ only protects against spells with the light or _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|shadow]]_ descriptor. Finally, the armor allows the wearer to pass through shimmering curtains of light. As an immediate action when charging, the armor can be activated to select any 10-foot-square area in the path of the charge. A curtain of multicolored light appears momentarily on each side of this area. The wearer can charge across this area as though it did not exist, disappearing into a ripple of light on one side and reappearing in a ripple of light on the other side. The wearer ignores terrain or obstacles in the intervening area (allowing the wearer to _[[feats/Charge Through|charge through]]_ allies in the area, for example), and the intervening area does not count toward the wearer's charge movement. The ripple of light cannot be used for movement by anyone except the wearer and the wearer's rider.

### _[[spells/Destruction|Destruction]]_

The _barding of pleated light_ is destroyed if it's reduced to 0 hit points in an area of absolute _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_ with no light—not even a _[[items/Mundane/Candle|candle]]_'s flicker or reflected moonbeam—within 10 miles in any direction.
