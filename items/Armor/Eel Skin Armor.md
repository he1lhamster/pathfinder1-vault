  "This red _+2 slick electricity resistance leather armor_ is crafted from the skin of the crimson hagfish, more commonly known as the Shackles slime eel. The armor exudes a slippery slime that grants its wearer a +5 competence bonus on Escape Artist and Swim checks. In addition, as a standard action once per day, the wearer can form an aura of electricity around himself that persists for 5 rounds. Creatures adjacent to the wearer when this power is activated and at the start of the wearer's turn take 2d6 points of electricity damage and are staggered for 1 round. A successful DC 14 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the staggering effect. The aura persists for 5 rounds."
