  "This _+2 light fortification banded mail_ has a small, ovoid stone set in the left shoulder. The armor monitors the wearer's hit point total as the spell _status_. If an attack against the wearer does enough damage to kill him outright, he and his gear are teleported to a specific location determined at the time of the armor's creation. This effect acts in all other ways as the spell _word of recall_, with the predetermined location considered the place of sanctuary. The wearer's body is protected from decomposition for 18 days as per the _gentle repose_ spell. Once this ability has been used, the stone set into the armor crumbles to dust and the armor reverts to being a suit of _+2 light fortification banded mail_."
