Description: |
  "The _warden of the woods_ is a suit of _+3 greenwood splint mail_ made of strips of laminated greenwood that flex with the wearer's movement but stiffen when struck in battle. (The greenwood special material is described on page 50.) This armor is treated in all ways like medium armor, including when determining proficiency. The armor has an arcane spell failure chance of 25%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +2, and an armor check penalty of –4.
  As a move action, the wearer can snap a strip of wood loose from the armor. The strip lengthens into a weapon of a type chosen by the armor's wearer. It can become a _+1 greenwood club_, a _+1/+1 greenwood quarterstaff_, or a _+1 keen greenwood wooden stake_. If the wearer creates a club or quarterstaff in this way, it gains the benefits of the _shillelagh_ spell with a duration of 1 minute. Each weapon removed from the _warden of the woods_ reduces the armor's enhancement bonus by 1. Consequently, a maximum of three such weapons can be separated from the armor at any given time. The greenwood weapons keep their enhancement bonuses only while they're in the wearer's hands, though they remain masterwork weapons for other wielders.
  The wearer can reintegrate a weapon back into the _warden of the woods_ as a move action and restore the lost enhancement bonus. Each day at dawn, the armor regenerates any missing strips (regaining its full enhancement bonus), and any weapons still detached from the armor crumble into dust."
