  "Legend tells that the first suits of _empyreal armor_ were forged from the battered, cast-off breastplates worn by solars in battle. These suits were gifted to powerful mortal heroes and have since changed hands many times.
  _Empyreal armor_ is made of steel forged so that it reflects a golden sheen in the sunlight. This armor functions as a suit of _+3 moderate fortification full plate_. In addition, three times per day, its wearer can activate a _fire shield_ (warm shield only) that lasts for 13 rounds. Any creature attacking the wearer with its body or a handheld weapon while the _fire shield_ effect is active deals normal damage but takes 1d6+13 points of damage in return. Half this damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to energy resistance."
