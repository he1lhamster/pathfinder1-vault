Description: |
  "Each of the yellow ribbons that spill from the joints of this jaundiced suit of _+3 studded leather armor_ bears one or more haunting runes. Three times per day, a cleric (or other class with cleric domains) with the Rune domain can use her blast rune domain power to mark one of the ribbons rather than a square. Such blast runes last until the next time the cleric prepares spells and cannot benefit from other domain abilities such as spell rune. As a swift action while wearing this armor, the cleric can cause one of the ribbons to lash out and touch an adjacent creature, triggering the blast rune as if the target had entered the warded square. When marking a ribbon with a blast rune, the cleric can instead expend two daily uses of The Forbidden Name's ability to also apply the benefits of another Rune domain (or subdomain) power such as spell rune or warding rune to the blast rune.
  Alternatively, any wearer can expend two daily uses when casting _glyph of warding_ or _explosive runes_ —or three uses when casting _greater glyph of warding_ —on a ribbon to treat it much like a blast rune. As a swift action while wearing the armor, she can trigger the glyph as though she had stepped on it; however, she takes half damage from the effect on a failed Reflex saving throw or no damage if successful."

### Description

Each of the yellow ribbons that spill from the joints of this jaundiced suit of +3 _[[items/Armor/Studded leather armor|studded leather armor]]_ bears one or more haunting runes. Three times per day, a _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ (or other class with _cleric_ domains) with the Rune domain can use her blast rune domain power to mark one of the ribbons rather than a square. Such blast runes last until the next time the _cleric_ prepares spells and cannot benefit from other domain abilities such as spell rune. As a swift action while wearing this armor, the _cleric_ can cause one of the ribbons to lash out and touch an adjacent creature, triggering the blast rune as if the target had entered the warded square. When marking a ribbon with a blast rune, the _cleric_ can instead _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ two daily uses of _[[items/Armor/The Forbidden Name|The Forbidden Name]]_'s ability to also apply the benefits of another Rune domain (or subdomain) power such as spell rune or _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Warding|warding]]_ rune to the blast rune.

Alternatively, any wearer can _expend_ two daily uses when casting _[[spells/Glyph Of Warding|glyph of warding]]_ or _[[spells/Explosive Runes|explosive runes]]_ —or three uses when casting greater _glyph of warding_ —on a ribbon to treat it much like a blast rune. As a swift action while wearing the armor, she can trigger the glyph as though she had stepped on it; however, she takes half damage from the effect on a failed Reflex saving throw or no damage if successful.
