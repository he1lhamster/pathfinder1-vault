Description: |
  "The following suit of armor is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.
  Normally found sized for Small humanoids, this battered and rusted suit of _+1 fire resistance full plate_ resists any attempts to polish out its blemishes. When a critical hit is confirmed against the wearer with a manufactured weapon, natural weapon, or unarmed strike, there is a 50% chance that the armor negates the critical hit. Such a blow knocks the armor out of alignment, giving it the broken condition until the wearer spends 1d4+1 minutes refitting the pieces (or 1 minute if another person assists in the process). This does not otherwise harm the armor. While out of alignment, the _goblin plate_ cannot negate critical hits. Broken armor provides only half the usual AC bonus (rounded down), and any armor check penalty is doubled."
