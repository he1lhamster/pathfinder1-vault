Description: |
  "This _+3 breastplate_ is crafted from the carapace of a giant scarab beetle, enchanted to be as hard and reflective as polished steel. The wearer suffers only half damage from vermin swarms and gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against the extraordinary abilities of vermin swarms.
  In addition, once per day on command, the wearer can transform the _scarab breastplate_ into a swarm of scarab beetles that skitter from her chest to attack creatures nearby. This swarm has statistics identical to an army ant swarm (_Bestiary_ 16) and attacks any creatures within its space. The wearer can command the swarm to move (including changing the shape of the swarm) as a move action, but the swarm must remain adjacent to her. If the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points, if the wearer is forced to move away from the swarm, or if the wearer commands it to return to her as a move action, the swarm crawls back onto the wearer's torso and returns to armor form. While the swarm is active, the wearer is not considered to be wearing the _scarab breastplate_ (except for purposes of commanding the swarm) and gains no defensive benefits from it.
  A druid of 6th level wearing a _scarab breastplate_ can use her wild shape ability to duplicate _vermin shape I_ (_Ultimate Magic_). At 8th level, she can also use it to duplicate _vermin shape II_ (_Ultimate Magic_)."
