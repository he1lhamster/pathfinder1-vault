Description: |
  "Designed to resemble the wide scales on a serpent's belly, this armor functions as a _+1 breastplate of fire resistance_. The first time the wearer is struck in melee, the armor animates and begins crushing its wearer. On the round that the armor animates, it automatically grapples the wearer. In following rounds, at the beginning of the wearer's turn, the armor makes a grapple combat maneuver check (CMB +20) to constrict the wearer. If successful, the armor deals 2d6 points of damage each round. Once animated, the armor releases its grip only when it is destroyed or its wearer dies. The wearer can't physically remove the armor once it activates, but others can help destroy or remove it. This armor functions normally (without animating) when worn by unliving creatures such as constructs and undead."
