Description: |
  "The tall, silver collar on this _+2 mithral armored coat_ is attractively set off by the coat's deep navy hues and ivory silk trim. A _lifecollar coat_ occupies both the chest and the neck magic item slots. The wearer receives a +2 circumstance bonus to AC and CMD against attacks or maneuvers that specifically target the wearer's neck or throat (such as a vampire's check to establish or maintain a pin or the roll to confirm a critical hit with a _vorpal_ weapon).
  Additionally, when struck by an attack that would bestow a negative level, the wearer has a 50% chance of avoiding the negative level. The wearer may not avoid more than 1 negative level per round in this fashion. This effect does not mitigate any other damage or remove negative levels previously gained.
  The silver collar can be collapsed and lowered as a full-round action. Doing so frees up the wearer's neck slot for other items, but the wearer loses the circumstance bonus to AC and CMD against attacks and maneuvers targeting the neck or throat."
