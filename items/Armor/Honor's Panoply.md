Description: |
  "This immaculate set of _+1 full plate_ adorned with gilt flourishes and imagery of lions, and embossed red accents. When worn, the armor grants its wearer a +2 sacred bonus on all saves against spells with the evil descriptor or cast by evil creatures.
  Once per day as a swift action, the wearer of _honor's panoply_ can call upon Iomedae for protection. For the next 5 minutes, the armor glows with an aura of golden light, and any hostile creature within 20 feet of the wearer must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or take a –2 penalty to its Armor Class and on attack rolls and saving throws for the duration, or until it hits the wearer with an attack. The wearer can dismiss this effect before the duration expires as a swift action on his turn to heal itself of 3d8+5 points of damage in a burst of healing energy.
  A creature with the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat and at least 5 ranks in the Craft (armor) skill can perform a ritual to corrupt _honor's panoply_, shifting its dedication to an evil deity. This ritual takes 6 days to complete, costs 2,000 gp in incense and materials, and requires a successful DC 19 Craft (armor) check. If the magic warhammer Sinderbos (see page 42) is used during the ritual, the cost of the ritual is reduced by 1,000 gp and requires only a successful DC 10 Craft (armor) check to complete. Once performed, the ritual transforms the armor into _infamy's panoply_; the armor turns black, the lions become animals sacred to the evil deity to which the armor is dedicated, and the red accents turn the crimson of fresh blood. The ritual also inverts the armor's effects: the save bonus is now profane and applies to spells with the good descriptor or cast by good creatures, and the armor now emanates a palpable aura of horror, causing non-allies to be shaken on a failed save. Dismissing this effect now grants the wearer fast healing 2 for 1 minute."
