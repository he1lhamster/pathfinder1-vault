Description: |
  "The _Shield of Aroden_ is a _+5 light fortification spell resistance (17) heavy wooden shield_. Once per day, the bearer can invoke a form of _fire shield_ that protects against cold attacks and damages opponents with fire and holy damage similarly to the spell _flame strike_. Once per round as an immediate action, if an adjacent ally is hit by a ranged or melee attack, the bearer can use the shield to redirect the attack to himself, taking all effects from that attack as if he were the intended target. All allies within 100 feet of the bearer gain the effect of _bless_ and _prayer_. Additionally, all allies within 100 feet of the bearer know his relative position and condition, as per the spell _status_.
  Beyond these properties, the _Shield of Aroden_ is designed to protect its bearer from death. Any attack that would kill the bearer (not merely make him unconscious or dying) triggers this ability, redirecting the lethal attack fully upon the shield and leaving the bearer unharmed (even if the attack normally only works on living creatures). For example, if the bearer failed a saving throw against _flesh to stone_, the shield would turn to stone and shatter instead, whereas if the bearer failed his save against _horrid wilting_, the shield would turn to dry splinters. This power always destroys the shield, reducing it to 1d20 nearly invulnerable shards that suggest the way in which it was last destroyed.
  The _Shield of Aroden_ bestows two negative levels on any chaotic creature that attempts to wield it. These negative levels remain as long as the shield is held or carried. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the creature possesses the shield."
Destruction: |
  "The _Shield of Aroden_ is designed to be destroyed, but the supposedly invulnerable shards left by its destruction can be utterly destroyed if they are consumed by a chaotic neutral being at least as powerful as a demigod, such as the proteans' Speakers of the Depths or the Eldest known as Count Ranalc."

Once per day, the bearer can invoke a form of _[[spells/Fire Shield|fire shield]]_ that protects against cold attacks and damages opponents with fire and holy damage similarly to the spell _[[spells/Flame Strike|flame strike]]_.

Beyond these properties, the _Shield of Aroden_ is designed to protect its bearer from death. Any attack that would kill the bearer (not merely make him _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_ or _[[conditions/Dying|dying]]_) triggers this ability, redirecting the lethal attack fully upon the _shield_ and leaving the bearer unharmed (even if the attack normally only works on living creatures). For example, if the bearer failed a saving throw against _[[spells/Flesh to Stone|flesh to stone]]_, the _shield_ would turn to stone and _[[spells/Shatter|shatter]]_ instead, whereas if the bearer failed his save against _[[spells/Horrid Wilting|horrid wilting]]_, the _shield_ would turn to dry splinters. This power always destroys the _shield_, reducing it to 1d20 nearly invulnerable shards that suggest the way in which it was last destroyed.

The _Shield of Aroden_ bestows two negative levels on any chaotic creature that attempts to wield it. These negative levels remain as long as the _shield_ is held or carried. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including _[[spells/Restoration|restoration]]_ spells) while the creature possesses the _shield_.

### _[[spells/Destruction|Destruction]]_

The _Shield of Aroden_ is designed to be destroyed, but the supposedly invulnerable shards left by its _destruction_ can be utterly destroyed if they are consumed by a chaotic neutral being at least as powerful as a demigod, such as the proteans' Speakers of the Depths or the Eldest known as Count Ranalc.
