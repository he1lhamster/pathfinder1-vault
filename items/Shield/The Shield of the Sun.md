Description: |
  "This _+5 heavy shield_, emblazoned with the symbol of the sun, allows the wielder to cast spells as if she were a 20th-level paladin with a Charisma of 20. The spells gained are cumulative with any existing spells per day the character might have, even from paladin class levels. The _Shield of the Sun_ also grants its wielder spell resistance 15. It absorbs the first 10 points of damage from any energy attack (fire, cold, acid, electricity, or sonic). In return for all this, once per year the shield's owner must undertake a quest at the behest of a lawful good deity (no saving throw to avoid).
  A chaotic or evil character gains four negative levels when wielding the _Shield of the Sun_. The negative levels persist as long as the shield is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells). The negative levels disappear when the shield is stowed or leaves the wearer's possession."
Destruction: |
  "The _Shield of the Sun_ may be destroyed if a good-aligned character casts it into the Well of Eternal Night, its light fading into the inky depths before it finally disappears. If a nongood character does the deed, the shield is not destroyed, merely lost, and a quest to the Plane of Shadow may recover it."
