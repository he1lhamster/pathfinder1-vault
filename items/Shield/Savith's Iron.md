Description: |
  "This large iron shield acts as a _+1 animated light fortification heavy steel shield_. The shield's bearer is immune to poison, although poisons in effect before the shield is wielded still run their course. While _Savith's Iron_ is wielded, poisoned attacks instead bolster the bearer: if the bearer is subjected by a foe to a poison that deals ability score damage, the bearer gains a +4 enhancement bonus to the ability score the poison would normally damage. This bonus lasts for 1 minute; each additional dose of the same poison extends the effect for 1 additional minute. The bearer can benefit from only one bonus at a time, but can choose to benefit from a new poison in place of an old one. For example, when the bearer of _Savith's Iron_ is stung by a wyvern, she gains a +4 enhancement bonus to her Constitution score for 1 minute; if she then comes in contact with terinav root, she must to decide whether to maintain her Constitution bonus or swap it out for a +4 enhancement bonus to her Dexterity. _Savith's Iron_ does not grant the wielder bonuses from poisons she takes willingly or those applied by an ally, and poisons that don't inflict ability score damage have no effect."
