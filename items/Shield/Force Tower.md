  "This _+1 arrow deflection ghost touch mithral tower shield_ glows with a perpetual bluish radiance. Infused with magical force, a _force tower_ renders its wielder immune to _magic missiles_ and also allows its wielder to use its _arrow deflection_ special ability to deflect magical rays and ranged touch attacks. The Reflex save DC to deflect such attacks is equal to 20 + the level of the spell (or 1/2 the class level or Hit Dice of the creature that created the effect, if a supernatural effect). If a spell or effect creates multiple rays or attacks, the _force tower_ deflects only one of them per round."
