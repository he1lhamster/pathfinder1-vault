### Description

Found with disturbing frequency amid treasure caches in the wilderness of Loric Fells, this +1 _[[items/Shield/Light wooden shield|light wooden shield]]_ has what appears to be a human face stretched across its front, with the weathered skin held in place by thick iron studs. Three times per day on _[[spells/Command|command]]_, the open mouth of the face can emit one of the two following effects:

* A burst of terrified screams that causes creatures in a 30-foot cone to become _[[conditions/Panicked|panicked]]_ as if by the _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ spell. A successful DC 16 Will save causes a creature to become _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 1 round instead.
* A tortured voice pleading for help. Anyone within 60 feet of the _shield_ hears the voice in her own language, spoken as if by a member of her own race.
