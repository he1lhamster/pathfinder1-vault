Description: |
  "Considered the greatest archers among the Shoanti people, the folk of the Lyrune-Quah tribe treasure this _+2 klar_ shaped from the skull of a lion. The specific shape of the skull allows the wielder to properly hold and shoot a shortbow (though not a longbow) while still benefiting from the _Lyrune-Quah klar's_ shield bonus.
  Up to three times per day as a free action, the wielder of a _Lyrune-Quah klar_ can utter praise to the nature totem of the moon. The next arrow fired after the prayer trails a line of shimmering stars in its wake. If a creature is struck by this arrow, the stars orbit it for the next 8 rounds, negating any concealment for the target and causing it to emit light as if it were holding a sunrod."
