  "This _+2 mirrored heavy steel shield_ is infused with the spite of divs, allowing its bearer to terrify and disgust foes with twisted reflections of themselves. As a move action up to three times per day, the wielder can show an adjacent creature its reflection in the shield's mirrored surface. As the creature looks at its mirror image, the image changes to show the creature hideously warped, covered with plague sores, or otherwise twisted. The creature must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or become shaken and sickened for 2d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and it can be avoided as though it were a gaze attack."
