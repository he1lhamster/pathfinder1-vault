### Description

A _[[items/Rod/Nightmare Rod|nightmare rod]]_ is a wooden rod with a smooth, purple, crystalline _[[monsters/Octopus|octopus]]_ clutching one end, its tentacles wrapped around the length of the rod and its bulbous body serving as a sort of mace head. Indeed, a _nightmare rod_ can be wielded as a +2 _[[items/Weapon/Heavy mace|heavy mace]]_. On a critical hit, a _nightmare rod_ floods the target's mind with horrific visions of nightmarish dooms that stagger the victim for 1 round if it fails a DC 15 Will save. This is a mind-affecting _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effect. In addition, a _nightmare rod_ has the following powers.

* Once per day as a free action when the rod hits a living creature, the user can affect the creature struck with a _[[spells/Phantasmal Killer|phantasmal killer]]_ spell (Will/Fort DC 16).
* Once per day, the user can cast _[[spells/Nightmare|nightmare]]_. If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, the wielder need not enter a trance (as he would if he had cast the spell)—the _nightmare rod_ maintains its own sort of trance on the spell and automatically finishes casting the spell as soon as the recipient falls asleep. If the recipient does not fall asleep within 24 hours, the _nightmare rod_ ceases attempting to cast the spell automatically.
* As long as the wielder carries the _nightmare rod_ in his hand, he is immune to _fear_ effects.
