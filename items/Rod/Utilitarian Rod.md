Price: "5000 gp"
Weight: "5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "8"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "Created by the Arcanamirium, this plain wooden rod is capped with steel, with 10 buttons along its length; it looks rugged and is usually scratched and stained. Pushing any of the buttons is an action equivalent to drawing a weapon. Unless otherwise stated, pressing a button a second time reverts the rod to its basic form. The following functions have no limit on the number of times they can be employed.
  _Brace/jack_: The end caps flatten into 2-foot-diameter discs and the wooden haft extends up to 10 feet, creating a brace for a tunnel ceiling or lifting a heavy object 10 feet into the air.
  _Bridge_: The rod flattens and extends to 1 foot wide, 1 inch thick, and 12 feet long. This form can support 4,000 pounds.
  _Climbing pole/ladder_: A spike that can anchor in stone extrudes from one end, while the other sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 50 feet in a single round. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds.
  _Crowbar_: This functions like a normal crowbar.
  _Drill_: One metal cap extends to a drill-like point and begins to spin, easily drilling a 3-inch-diameter hole through 3 feet of wood or 1 foot of stone per minute.
  _Mallet_: Though not intended as a weapon, a character can attack with the rod in this form as if it were a Medium warhammer with a –2 penalty.
  _Portable ram_: This functions like a normal portable ram, except up to three people are needed to help the wielder.
  _Saw_: This works like a normal two-person saw.
  _Shovel_: Pressing this button makes the rod cycle between a short-handled shovel, a long-handled shovel, and its basic form.
  _Wedge_: One metal cap extends to form a flat chisel shape, such as for cutting wood or breaking stone (normally a hammer or mallet is used with it for this task)."
