  Extinguishing a Large or larger nonmagical fire or a magic fire of size Medium or smaller (such as that of a flaming weapon or a _burning hands_ spell), expends 1 charge. Continual magic flames, such as those generated by a weapon or a fire creature, are suppressed for 6 rounds and flare up again after that time. To extinguish an instantaneous fire spell, the rod must be within the area of the effect and the wielder must have used a ready action, effectively countering the entire spell.

  If a _rod of flame extinguishing_ is touched to a creature with the fire subtype by making a successful melee touch attack, the rod deals 6d6 points of damage to the creature. This use requires 3 charges.
  A _rod of flame extinguishing_ has 10 charges when found. Spent charges are renewed every day, so that a wielder can expend up to 10 charges in any 24-hour period."
