Description: |
  "This black poker has a cherry-red tip, as though fresh from a searing fire. The more artful interrogators of Cheliax well understand that their subjects soon learn to welcome unconsciousness and even death as a means to escape torture. To frustrate their victim's respite, a torturer's _wracking rod_ delivers a painful jolt that keeps the target alert for an extended session of interrogation. On a successful touch attack, the victim receives the benefit of a _cure light wounds_ spell (ld8+1) but must also make a DC 16 Fortitude save or be sickened for 2d4 rounds. Over the decades, desperate members of Cheliax's underclass have found that these rods double as black market sources of emergency healing. A _wracking rod_ can be used up to 5 times per day."
