Type: "Rod"
Price: "35000 gp"
Weight: "5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "17"
Aura: "strong evocation"
Description: |
  "This silvery rod is spoon-sized and utterly featureless. A creature holding a _rod of delumination_ can extinguish any ability, item, or spell effect that is acting as a light source simply by pointing one end of the rod at the light and uttering a command word. Sources of magical light receive a DC 15 Will saving throw to negate this effect and have a Will save bonus equal to half their caster level; if the original caster of the effect is still within the spell's range, the spell can use its caster's Will save bonus instead. If a light source succeeds at its saving throw against a _rod of delumination_, the same rod cannot affect it again for 24 hours. No other properties of an affected creature, item, or spell are altered other than its ability to shed light; a torch continues to burn, a lantern continues to consume oil, and so on.
  The bearer can, if she chooses, utter a second command word to reignite any light source the rod has previously extinguished, provided that the light source's normal duration hasn't expired."
