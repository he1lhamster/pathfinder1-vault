Description: |
  "This flanged iron rod is much heavier than it looks, and grants the wielder a portion of the skill of a master coldwarper. The wielder gains a +5 competence bonus on Craft checks involving metal.
  A _coldwarp key_ has three charges, which are renewed at midnight every night and can be expended to create a variety of effects. Expending one charge from a _coldwarp key_ allows the wielder to use _fabricate_ (as the spell) to affect metal only. If the wielder is in a natural underground environment, she can expend two charges from a _coldwarp key_ to draw raw metal ore from the surrounding stone and shape it to her liking. This ability acts as the _major creation_ spell, except the wielder can create only base metals and the duration is instantaneous."
