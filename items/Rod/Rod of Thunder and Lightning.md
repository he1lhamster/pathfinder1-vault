### Description

Constructed of iron set with silver rivets, this rod has the properties of a +2 _[[items/Weapon/Light mace|light mace]]_. Its other powers are as follows.

* **Lightning**: Once per day, when the wielder desires, a short _[[spells/Spark|spark]]_ of electricity can leap forth when the rod strikes an opponent to deal the normal damage for a +2 _light mace_ (1d6+2) and an extra 2d6 points of electricity damage. Even when the rod fails to score a normal hit in combat, if the roll was good enough to count as a successful melee touch attack, then the 2d6 points of electricity damage still apply. The wielder activates this power as a free action, and it works if he strikes an opponent within 1 round.
* **Lightning Stroke**: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to shoot out a 5-foot-wide _[[spells/Lightning Bolt|lightning bolt]]_ dealing 9d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 16 half) to a range of 200 feet.
* **Thunder**: Once per day, the rod can strike as a +3 _light mace_, and the opponent struck is _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_ from the noise of the rod's _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Impact|impact]]_ (Fortitude DC 16 negates). Activating this sonic power counts as a free action, and it works if the wielder strikes an opponent within 1 round.
* **Thunderclap**: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to give out a deafening noise, just as a _[[spells/Shout|shout]]_ spell (Fortitude DC 16 partial, 2d6 points of sonic damage, target _[[conditions/Deafened|deafened]]_ for 2d6 rounds).
* **Thunder and Lightning**: Once per week as a standard action, the wielder of the rod can combine the thunderclap power with a _lightning bolt_, as in the lightning stroke power. The thunderclap affects all creatures within 10 feet of the bolt. The lightning stroke deals 9d6 points of electricity damage (count rolls of 1 or 2 as rolls of 3, for a range of 27 to 54 points), and the thunderclap deals 2d6 points of sonic damage. A single DC 16 Reflex save applies for both effects.
