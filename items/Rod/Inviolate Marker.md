Weight: "5 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "10"
Aura: "moderate transmutation"
Description: |
  "This unusual type of _immovable rod_ has a button near each end, and it can be activated only by two separate creatures, each one pressing a button while speaking a different command word. Once set in place, it can only be moved by the same method. A creature using a Strength check to move the _inviolate marker_ risks being affected by a _bestow curse_ effect (–6 Str; Will DC 16 negates and grants the creature immunity to the curse effect for 24 hours).
  An _inviolate marker_ projects an illusory banner or crest from each side, each chosen by the creature that activated it, and is used to demarcate territorial boundaries. If an _inviolate marker_ would be buried by a change in the landscape or environment, the marker teleports to the surface of the newly formed terrain in order to maintain its position relative to the new terrain."
