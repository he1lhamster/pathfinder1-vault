Description: |
  "This ornate scepter of bronze and mithral has a flanged head like a golden-white sunburst. A _scepter of heaven_ acts as a _+1 evil outsider bane morningstar_. The scepter has the following powers when wielded by a good-aligned creature.
  If the wielder of a _scepter of heaven_ wears a _crown of heaven_, the scepter's caster level increases to 15th (increasing its aura to strong) and, when used as a weapon, it gains the _holy_ property. A good-aligned wielder may also use _holy smite_, _holy sword_, and _holy word_, as the spells, once per day each.
  A _scepter of heaven_ is of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains one negative level. The negative level remains as long as the rod is in hand and disappears when the rod is no longer held. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the rod is being held."
