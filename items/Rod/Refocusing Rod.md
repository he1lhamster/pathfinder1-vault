Title: "Refocusing Rod"
Type: "Rod"
Price: "5000 gp"
Weight: "1 lb."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "10"
Aura: "moderate universal"
Description: |
  "Once per day, a _refocusing rod_ allows an occultist to t ransfer mental focus using the shift focus class feature without losing any points of focus. He can move focus from one implement into the rod, and then from the rod into another implement, by spending twice as long as it normally takes him to shift focus (because he's making two transfers). The occultist must transfer the focus from the rod within 10 minutes or the focus is lost.
  If an occultist chooses a _refocusing rod_ as one of his implements for the day, he can instead use this ability to transfer focus into the rod and leave it there or transfer focus he already stored in the rod into another implement. In either of these cases, no points of focus are lost in the transfer and it takes the normal amount of time to shift focus instead of twice as long. If the _refocusing rod_ is not one of the occultist's implements for the day, mental focus stored in it can't be used for any purpose except transference to another implement.
  Any mental focus transferred into the rod still belongs to the occultist who transferred it. The rod can't be used to transfer mental focus between two users."
