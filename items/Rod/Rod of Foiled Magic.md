Description: |
  "This rod is similar in appearance to a _metamagic rod_. Once a creature picks up such a rod, it cannot be discarded without use of a _remove curse_ spell or similar magic. Each time the wielder casts a spell, he takes the _rod of foiled magic_ in hand and treats the caster level of the spell as 2 levels lower. If this would reduce the caster level to 0 or lower, than the caster has only a 50% chance of casting the spell (any chance of arcane spell failure is added to this percentile chance), but if he is able to cast the spell, the spell has a caster level of 1st."
