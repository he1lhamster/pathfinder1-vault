Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate evocation"
Description: |
  "This small darkwood rod is adorned with a carving of a figure whose own weapon is curled backward as if to strike the figure. Three times per day, the user can speak the rod's command word to curse a single manufactured weapon within 30 feet. If the weapon is magical, it can attempt a DC 16 Will save to avoid the curse. Whenever the cursed weapon damages a creature, it deals half as much damage to its wielder as well; only the weapon's base damage and the wielder's Strength bonus are factored into this damage—bonus damage from a magic weapon's special abilities, from its wielder's class features and feats, or from other effects are not factored into the damage dealt to the wielder. This is a curse effect that lasts for 7 rounds."
