  "The _Scepter of the Arclords_ is a powerful device capable of harvesting all the ambient magic from a large area and focusing it into a single powerful effect.

This automatically succeeds, but there is a 10% chance the wielder also gains a random minor spellblight (_Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic_ 94).
  Additionally, once per week the wielder can command the item to create any magic effect he desires. Roll d% to determine the effect of this command.
