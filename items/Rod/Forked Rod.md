Description: |
  "This bifurcated mithral rod resembles an oversized tuning fork. The _forked rod_ acts as a focus for _plane shift_, but the plane to which it is attuned to can be adjusted as a standard action—a _forked rod_ can be attuned to any plane that a common tuning fork (see _plane shift_) can be attuned to. Once per day, a _forked rod_ can be used to cast _plane shift_ to the plane it is currently attuned to. Three times per day as a standard action, the user can attack a creature or object with a _forked rod_ as if it were a _+1 light mace_. On a hit, the _forked rod_ deals no damage, but affects the target with _dimensional anchor_ for 9 minutes. As long as a target is affected in this way, the _forked rod_ is inert and cannot be used to cast _plane shift_, as a focus for _plane shift_, or to affect another target with _dimensional anchor_."
