Description: |
  "The head of this rod is carved to resemble the visage of the Ancient Osirian deity Apep, Devourer of the Dawn, god of chaos, darkness, destruction, and snakes. A _rod of the devoured dawn_ can be wielded as a _+1 heavy mace_. When holding the rod, the wielder gains darkvision with a range of 30 feet. Once per day, the rod can create a shadowy _hypnotic pattern_ that also functions as _dispel magic_ and targets any spells with the light descriptor in the area of effect.
  When the wielder confirms a critical hit with a _rod of the devoured dawn_ on a Medium or smaller foe, the head of the rod animates and grants an automatic grapple check against the creature struck (this does not provoke an attack of opportunity). If the grapple check is successful, the rod's jaw unhinges and expands momentarily to swallow the creature, gulping it into a flesh-walled extradimensional space. The swallowed target gains the grappled condition and takes 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage per round on its turn. The creature can cut its way out (AC 14, hp 24) or wriggle out with a successful DC 25 Escape Artist check as a full-round action—either method of escape causes the victim to be disgorged from the rod into an adjacent space. The rod automatically disgorges a swallowed victim if the swallowed creature dies or if the rod is destroyed. Only one creature can be swallowed at a time. A _rod of the devoured dawn_ only functions if its wielder is chaotic."
