  "Among the varied items crafted by the earliest Storm Kindlers were these potent rods. Very few _Storm Kindler's rods_ have been recovered, and today's Storm Kindlers suspect that many of these potent magical rods have been lost forever, for when they are wielded by those not of the Storm Kindler sect, they grow fragile. The current generation of Storm Kindlers have been unsuccessful in determining how their predecessors created these powerful minor artifacts, making the discovery of existing _Storm Kindler's rods_ all the more important to the society.
  A _Storm Kindler's rod_ acts as a _+4 shocking burst spell storing club_, but its _spell storing_ capabilities can store only druid spells. While carried in one hand, the rod grants its wielder immunity to cold and electricity. The rod's other powers are as follows."
Destruction: |
  "A Storm Kindler's rod can be destroyed as easily as a typical _+4 shocking burst spell storing club_ after it has been carried for at least 24 hours by someone not part of or affiliated with the Storm Kindlers."

### Description

Among the varied items crafted by the earliest Storm Kindlers were these _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ rods. Very few Storm Kindler's rods have been recovered, and today's Storm Kindlers suspect that many of these _potent_ magical rods have been lost forever, for when they are wielded by those not of the Storm Kindler sect, they grow fragile. The current generation of Storm Kindlers have been unsuccessful in determining how their predecessors created these powerful minor artifacts, making the discovery of existing Storm Kindler's rods all the more important to the society.

A _[[items/Rod/Storm Kindler's Rod|Storm Kindler's rod]]_ acts as a +4 _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Shocking Burst|shocking burst]]_ _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Spell Storing|spell storing]]_ _[[items/Weapon/Club|club]]_, but its _spell storing_ capabilities can store only _[[classes/Druid|druid]]_ spells. While carried in one hand, the rod grants its wielder _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to cold and electricity. The rod's other powers are as follows.

* Invoke Lightning: Up to three times per day as a swift action, the wielder can call down a stroke of lightning from the skies. This functions as _[[spells/Flame Strike|flame strike]]_, save that the damage dealt is half electricity and half from _[[spells/Divine Power|divine power]]_.
* _[[universal monster rules/Summon|Summon]]_ Lightning Elemental: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can _summon_ an elder lightning elemental, 1d3 greater lightning elementals, or 1d4+1 huge lightning elementals. This functions as per _[[spells/Summon Monster VIII|summon monster VIII]]_, except that it requires a standard action instead of a full round.
* Unleash Storm: Once per day, the wielder can call upon a devastating storm. This functions as _[[spells/Storm Of Vengeance|storm of vengeance]]_, save that on the second round, the storm creates freezing rain that deals cold damage rather than acid damage.
