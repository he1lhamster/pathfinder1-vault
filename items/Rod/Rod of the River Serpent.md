Description: |
  "This heavy rod is carved to look like the fanged head of the river serpent Apep, the primordial snake-being who was the deceiver, devourer, and destroyer of the sun, light, and life. You can use the rod as a _+1 heavy mace_. If you are chaotic, you can activate the other abilities of the rod.
  You gain darkvision at a range of 30 feet when you hold the rod. Once per day, you can use the rod to create an eerie pattern of shadows that acts as a _hypnotic pattern_ (Will DC 13 negates); this pattern also acts as a _dispel magic_ to any spells with the light descriptor within its area of effect.
  When you confirm a critical hit with the rod, it automatically attempts a grapple (+5 bonus) against the target as a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If the grapple check succeeds, the snake head on the rod unhinges its jaw to swallow the target whole into a flesh-walled extradimensional space. The swallowed target suffers 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage per round on its turn and is considered grappled. It can escape with a DC 20 Escape Artist check or by damaging the fleshy walls of the extradimensional prison (AC 12, 24 hit points); either means of escape causes the rod's mouth to expand and disgorge the trapped creature into a random adjacent square (as does the death of a swallowed creature). The prison can hold 1 Medium, 2 Small, 8 Tiny, or 32 Diminutive or smaller opponents."
