Description: |
  "This rod is indistinguishable from a _+1 light mace_. The rod bestows a +1 insight bonus on initiative checks. If grasped firmly, it enables the wielder to use _detect chaos_, _detect evil_, _detect good_, _detect law_, _detect magic_, _discern lies_, _light_, or _see invisibility_. Each different use is a standard action.
  If the head of a _rod of alertness_ is planted in the ground and the possessor wills it to alertness (a standard action), the rod senses any creatures within 120 feet that intend to harm the possessor. At the same time, the rod creates the effect of a _prayer_ spell upon all creatures friendly to the possessor in a 20-foot radius. Immediately thereafter, the rod sends forth a mental alert to these friendly creatures, warning them of any unfriendly creatures within the 120-foot radius. These effects last for 10 minutes, and the rod can perform this function once per day. Last, the rod can be used to simulate the casting of an _animate objects_ spell, utilizing any 11 (or fewer) Small objects located roughly around the perimeter of a 5-footradius circle centered on the rod when planted in the ground. Objects remain animated for 11 rounds. The rod can perform this function once per day."
