  "This ornately bejeweled baton confers the mark of rightful rulership on its bearer. The wielder of this scepter gains a +5 competence bonus on Knowledge (nobility) and Diplomacy checks. Furthermore, once per day, and on command, the wielder can affect up to seven living creatures with _good hope_, as the spell. If the wielder of a _suzerain scepter_ has the Leadership feat, she may attract double the normal number of followers for her Leadership score; however, if the rod is out of the wielder's possession for more than 1 week these extra followers leave.

Whenever the wielder creates an effect that provides a morale bonus to such creatures (not including the scepter's _bless_ effect), that bonus increases by 1."
