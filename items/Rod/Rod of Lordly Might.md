### Description

This rod has functions that are spell-like, and it can also be used as a _[[spells/Magic Weapon|magic weapon]]_ of various sorts. In addition, it has several more mundane uses. The _[[items/Rod/Rod of Lordly Might|rod of lordly might]]_ is metal and thicker than other rods, with a flanged ball at one end and six studlike buttons along its length. Pushing any of the rod's buttons is an action equivalent to drawing a weapon, and the rod weighs 10 pounds.

The following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per day.

* Use _[[spells/Hold Person|hold person]]_ upon a touched creature, if the wielder so commands (Will DC 14 negates). The wielder must choose to use this power (a free action) and then succeed at a melee touch attack to activate the power. If the attack fails, the effect is lost.
* Use _[[universal monster rules/Fear|Fear]]_ upon all enemies viewing it, if the wielder so desires (10-foot maximum range, Will DC 16 partial). Invoking this power is a standard action.
* Deal 2d4 hit points of damage to an opponent on a successful touch attack (Will DC 17 half) and cure the wielder of the same amount of damage. The wielder must choose to use this power before attacking, as with _hold person_.
