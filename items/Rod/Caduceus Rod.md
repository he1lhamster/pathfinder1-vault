Description: |
  "Two entwined wooden snakes run the length of this laurel rod, which is capped with a pair of brass wings. This mystical implement gives its possessor a +5 insight bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks and a +1 insight bonus on attack and damage rolls with alchemical items, including alchemists' bombs. When it's held in hand, the _caduceus rod_ can be invoked five times per day to grant one of the following boons, each of which counts as a 6th-level spell-like ability.
  **Awaken**: The rod awakens all sleeping creatures within a 40-foot-radius burst centered on the wielder. Creatures in the burst gain immunity to sleep effects for 1 minute.
  **Exchange**: The wielder transmutes one of his prepared alchemical extracts into an extract of another formula in his formula book of equal or lower level.
  **Mercy**: All dying (–1 or fewer hit points) creatures in a 40-foot-radius burst centered on the wielder die. Each such creature can attempt a DC 19 Fortitude save to instead take 1d6 points of negative energy damage. This is a death effect.
  **Revive**: The wielder targets a creature within 40 feet with empowered _breath of life_.
  **Slumber**: As _deep slumber_, except that it affects a 20-footradius burst centered on the wielder, can affect up to 20 HD of creatures, and has a Will save DC of 19. The wielder of the rod is unaffected and can choose to exclude up to four other targets from the effects."
