Title: "Fool's Scepter"
Type: "Rod"
Price: "50000 gp"
Weight: "3 lbs."
Slot: "Slotless"
Caster level: "12"
Aura: "strong divination, strong enchantment"
Description: |
  "This wooden marotte is topped with a jester's head whose comical face takes on the likeness of the wielder. As a free action, the wielder of a _fool's scepter_ can speak through the jester's head and imitate voices and sounds with a volume up to that of a dragon's roar. The wielder can also cause the jester's face to transform into the comic likeness of any creature she can visualize. Using a _fool's scepter_ in this manner grants a +5 circumstance bonus to Perform (comedy) checks.
  Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the jester head to take on the likeness of an individual creature within 60 feet and then harangue that creature with magically honed mockery. If the creature possesses an Intelligence of 3 or higher, they are dazed with humiliation for 2d6 rounds and shaken for 10 minutes. This is a mind-affecting, language-dependent compulsion effect, and is negated by a successful DC 15 Will saving throw.
  Once per week as a standard action, the wielder can query the jester's head for information regarding an individual creature. The head transforms into the likeness of that creature and recites a number of jocular stories over the next 2d6 × 10 minutes, providing information as per the _legend lore_ spell. If the subject of the wielder's query is present and within 60 feet, the head also provides information regarding the subject's thoughts, desires, personality, and motivations as if using _detect thoughts_, though the subject may negate this divination with a successful DC 15 Will save. In this circumstance, the head always answers in a voice that is loud enough to be audible to the subject of the query."
