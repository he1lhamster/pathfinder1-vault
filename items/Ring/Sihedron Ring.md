Weight: "–"
Slot: "Ring"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate abjuration, moderate illusion"
Description: |
  "This otherwise plain ring is adorned with a tiny Sihedron rune. These rings were given to agents and allies of the runelords as badges of office and tokens of appreciation for their work—sometimes, they were given as bribes to those a runelord was attempting to win to his cause. Like the more common _Sihedron medallion_, runelords have special links to _Sihedron rings_ that aid in scrying and observation of the world around the wearer of the ring.
  A _Sihedron ring_ grants a +3 deflection bonus to AC, a +3 resistance bonus on all saving throws, and protects the wearer with a constant _endure elements_ effect. At will, as a standard action, the wearer can use the _Sihedron ring_ to change the appearance of his clothing or armor into any other kind of clothing or armor. The actual clothing and armor worn retain all their properties (including weight) when glamered. Only _true seeing_ or similar magic reveals the true nature of the adornments."
