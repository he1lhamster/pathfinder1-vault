  "Popular among Riverfolk who prefer to work their waterway unarmed, this simple bronze band can transform into a handy weapon in a pinch. When the wearer of a _riverclub ring_ plunges her hand into at least 1 gallon of water as a move action, she can pull forth a club made of animated water. The weapon maintains the shape, solidity, and statistics of a masterwork club of the wielder's size so long as she holds it, dealing damage as normal, except that it deals 1 additional point of damage against creatures with the fire subtype. The club turns back into a puddle of water again as soon as the wielder loosens her grip around it."
