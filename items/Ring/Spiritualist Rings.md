### Description

These four garish and gaudy rings must be worn on one hand, though they take up only a single ring slot. They grant the wearer the ability to _[[spells/Commune|commune]]_ with and affect the dead in the following ways.

* The wearer can use _[[spells/Speak with Dead|speak with dead]]_, as the spell, three times per day. It takes 10 minutes to use this ability.
* The wearer can use _[[spells/Spectral Hand|spectral hand]]_, as the spell, three times per day.
* The wearer's weapons gain the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]]_ weapon special ability while the wearer is wielding the weapons.
* The wearer gains a +4 _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sacred|sacred]]_ or profane bonus on saving throws against positive and negative energy effects. The bonus depends on the wearer's alignment—good-aligned wearers gain a _sacred_ bonus, whereas evil-aligned wearers gain a profane bonus. Neutral-aligned wearers pick either a _sacred_ or profane bonus when the ring is first put on, which cannot be changed later .
