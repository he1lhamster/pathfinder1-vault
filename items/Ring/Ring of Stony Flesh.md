Description: |
  "A _ring of stony flesh_ gives the wearer's skin the appearance of flexible stone. Once per day, the wearer can expend a charge as a standard action to gain the benefits of _stoneskin_. While under this effect, the wearer gains the earth glide ability, allowing her to move through unworked stone or earth as easily as a fish swims through water. The wearer cannot move through stone composed of multiple blocks—such as the walls of a tomb or castle—with this ability, only through solid masses of stone. In addition, a _ring of stony flesh_ automatically nullifies any petrification effect that targets the wearer by expending 2 charges, provided the ring has at least 2 charges remaining. The ring's protection effect activates before the wearer attempts a saving throw against the petrification attempt. A _ring of stony flesh_ has 10 charges when created."
