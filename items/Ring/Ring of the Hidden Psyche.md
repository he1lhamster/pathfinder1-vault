Slot: "Ring"
Caster level: "18"
Aura: "strong universal"
Description: |
  "This ring resembles a _ring of psychic mastery_, but its flawless sapphire serves as a vessel for the wearer's soul. It possesses all the abilities of a _ring of psychic mastery_ in addition to the following effects.
  The wearer's soul instantly enters the ring upon the wearer's death, even if her body is utterly destroyed. This counts as an _object possession_ spell, except that the possessing soul cannot animate the ring and must instead wait for someone to wear it. From inside the ring, she can attempt a _greater possession_ on anyone who voluntarily wears the ring (Will DC 23 negates). A successful save against the _greater possession_ effect renders the new wearer immune to further such attempts for 24 hours. Dispelling the _object possession_ effect on the ring banishes the soul from the ring to its appropriate afterlife. Otherwise, a soul can remain in the ring indefinitely. While in the ring, the soul knows when a creature has put on the ring. The soul can't otherwise sense the area around it or take actions other than attempting the _greater possession_ effect.
  A _ring of the hidden psyche_ resists attempts to discern its true nature. _Detect magic_ reveals only the properties of a _ring of psychic mastery_, though _identify_ or stronger magic can reveal the ring's full powers if the caster succeeds at a DC 23 Will save."
