Description: |
  "Made of aged bronze and steel, this ring looks like it should have a gem set in it, but instead has an empty circular hole. The hole in the ring holds a single firearm bullet; if one is placed inside (as a full-round action), it merges seamlessly into the ring. While a bullet is merged into the ring, the wielder can fire the bullet as though she were using a _+1 pistol_ that can't misfire. Once the bullet has been fired from the ring, a new bullet can't be placed inside for 24 hours.
  Each _holdout ring_ is created with two +1 ammunition special abilities and one +2 ammunition special ability. If the wearer has the grit class feature, she can expend grit (maximum 4 grit points) to imbue bullets merged with the gun with one or more of these abilities. Imbuing a bullet with a +1 special ability costs 1 grit point; imbuing one with a +2 special ability costs 2 grit points. Each ring's special abilities are established upon the item's creation and can't be changed. If a special ability has multiple versions, as does _bane_, the specific version must be set at that time (e.g., _dragon bane_). A typical _holdout ring_ has the _flaming_, _seeking_, and _shocking burst_ special abilities."

### Description

Made of aged bronze and steel, this ring looks like it should have a gem set in it, but instead has an empty circular hole. The hole in the ring holds a single _[[items/Ammunition/Firearm bullet|firearm bullet]]_; if one is placed inside (as a full-round action), it merges seamlessly into the ring. While a bullet is merged into the ring, the wielder can fire the bullet as though she were using a +1 _[[items/Weapon/Pistol|pistol]]_ that can't misfire. Once the bullet has been fired from the ring, a new bullet can't be placed inside for 24 hours.

Each _[[items/Ring/Holdout Ring|holdout ring]]_ is created with two +1 ammunition special abilities and one +2 ammunition special ability. If the wearer has the grit class feature, she can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ grit (maximum 4 grit points) to imbue bullets merged with the gun with one or more of these abilities. Imbuing a bullet with a +1 special ability costs 1 grit point; imbuing one with a +2 special ability costs 2 grit points. Each ring's special abilities are established upon the item's creation and can't be changed. If a special ability has multiple versions, as does _[[spells/Bane|bane]]_, the specific version must be set at that time (e.g., dragon _bane_). A typical _holdout ring_ has the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Flaming|flaming]]_, seeking, and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Shocking Burst|shocking burst]]_ special abilities.
