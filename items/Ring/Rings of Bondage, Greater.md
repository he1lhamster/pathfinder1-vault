Description: |
  "These specialized rings function as _rings of bondage_, but a command imposed by the wearer of the master ring (including a mutual agreement affecting both wearers) takes 10 minutes to activate, is permanent, and functions as _geas/quest_, except a DC 16 Will save still negates it.
  In addition, the wearer of the master ring gains a continuous _sanctuary_ (DC 16) effect against the wearer of the servant ring, with a save required for every attack the servant makes against the master (including area attacks, but no save is required when directing allies or controlled creatures to attack the wearer); a failed save prevents only that single attack. Each time the servant successfully attacks the master, he must succeed at a second DC 16 Will save or be affected as _bestow curse_."
