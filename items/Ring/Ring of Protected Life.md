  "This silver ring features arboreal motifs, and is set with a small but brilliant sapphire. If the wearer has the channel energy class feature, the radius of his channeled energy increases by 5 feet. Additionally, when the wearer channels energy, he may choose to exempt one creature from the effects of his channeling. If the wearer has the Selective Channeling feat, the _ring of protected life_ increases the number of creatures he may normally exempt by one. Finally, once per day the wearer may channel energy as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity; doing so renders the _ring of protected life_ inert for 24 hours, during which time it does not confer any benefits."
