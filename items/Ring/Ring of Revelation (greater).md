Slot: "Ring"
Caster level: "11"
Aura: "moderate universal"
Description: |
  "A _ring of revelation_ is a divine item attuned to a particular oracular mystery and containing a revelation associated with that mystery (see the oracle class description). While wearing the ring, an oracle has access to that revelation and may use it as if she had it as a normal class feature. The oracle must have the appropriate mystery to use the ring, and must meet the level requirements (if any) of the revelation itself; for example, a _ring of revelation_ (combat healer) is only usable by an oracle of at least 7th level with the battle mystery. If the oracle already has that revelation and the revelation gives an ability with a limited number of uses per day, the oracle can use that ability one additional time per day. The ring has no effect if worn by a non-oracle, and Use Magic Device doesn't allow a character to gain a revelation from this ring.
  A _lesser ring of revelation_ contains a revelation that has no level prerequisite or a prerequisite that is less than 6th level. A _greater ring of revelation_ contains a revelation that requires the oracle to be 7th level or higher. A superior _ring of revelation_ contains a revelation that requires the oracle to be 11th level or higher."

### Description

A ring of _[[spells/Revelation|revelation]]_ is a divine item attuned to a particular oracular mystery and containing a _revelation_ associated with that mystery (see the _[[classes/Oracle|oracle]]_ class description). While wearing the ring, an _oracle_ has access to that _revelation_ and may use it as if she had it as a normal class feature. The _oracle_ must have the appropriate mystery to use the ring, and must meet the level requirements (if any) of the _revelation_ itself; for example, a ring of _revelation_ (combat _[[npcs/Healer|healer]]_) is only usable by an _oracle_ of at least 7th level with the battle mystery. If the _oracle_ already has that _revelation_ and the _revelation_ gives an ability with a limited number of uses per day, the _oracle_ can use that ability one additional time per day. The ring has no effect if worn by a non-oracle, and Use Magic Device doesn't allow a character to gain a _revelation_ from this ring.

A lesser ring of _revelation_ contains a _revelation_ that has no level prerequisite or a prerequisite that is less than 6th level. A greater ring of _revelation_ contains a _revelation_ that requires the _oracle_ to be 7th level or higher. A superior ring of _revelation_ contains a _revelation_ that requires the _oracle_ to be 11th level or higher.
