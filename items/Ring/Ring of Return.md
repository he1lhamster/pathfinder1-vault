Aura: "strong conjuration"
Description: |
  "The imperial intelligence agency, the Hatharat, entrusts _rings of return_ to agents within Taldor and other hostile regions. When a transport command word is spoken (a standard action), a _ring of return_ whisks the wearer to the nearest imperial administration building within Kelesh's borders, as if via _greater teleport_. If anyone attempts to remove a _ring of return_ from the wearer's finger without speaking a removal command word (a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity), the attempt triggers the effect, transporting both the wearer and the person attempting to remove the ring. A successful DC 20 Will save allows a character to resist the teleportation, but in any event, a _ring of return_ can be used only once; after its single charge is expended, it becomes an ordinary, nonmagical ring."
