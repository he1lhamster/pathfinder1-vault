Description: |
  "When this ring is worn, the wielder's skin attains a barely perceptible sheen. In practical terms, the wearer ignores the first 5 points of an object's hardness when performing a sunder combat maneuver or when smashing an object. She also does not take the standard –4 penalty for making a combat maneuver check to disarm while unarmed.
  Additionally, the ring's wearer can focus all of the ring's power, possibly repelling a devastating blow. Once per day, when a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on the wearer, there is a 50% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. Using this ability is an immediate action, and the wearer must decide to use it before the critical hit or sneak attack damage is rolled."
