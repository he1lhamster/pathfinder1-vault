Price: "200000 gp"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Ring"
Caster level: "15"
Aura: "strong conjuration"
Description: |
  "All four kinds of _rings of elemental command_ are very powerful. Each appears to be nothing more than a lesser magic ring until fully activated (by meeting a special condition, such as single-handedly slaying an elemental of the appropriate type or exposure to a sacred material of the appropriate element), but each has certain other powers as well as the following common properties.
  Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can't attack the wearer, or even approach within 5 feet of her. If the wearer desires, she may forgo this protection and instead attempt to charm the elemental (as charm monster, Will DC 17 negates). If the charm attempt fails, however, absolute protection is lost and no further attempt at charming can be made.
  Creatures from the plane to which the ring is attuned that attack the wearer take a –1 penalty on their attack rolls. The ring wearer makes applicable saving throws against the extraplanar creature's attacks with a +2 resistance bonus. She gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack rolls against such creatures. Any weapons he uses bypasses the damage reduction of such creatures, regardless of any qualities the weapon may or may not have.
  The wearer of the ring is able to converse with creatures from the plane to which her ring is attuned. These creatures recognize that she wears the ring, and show a healthy respect for the wearer if their alignments are similar. If alignments are opposed, creatures fear the wearer if she is strong. If she is weak, they hate and desire to slay her.
  The possessor of a ring of elemental command takes a saving throw penalty as follows.
  <table><tbody><tr><td>**Element**</td><td>**Saving Throw Penalty**</td></tr><tr><td>Air</td><td>–2 against earth-based effects</td></tr><tr><td>Earth</td><td>–2 against air- or electricity-based effects</td></tr><tr><td>Fire</td><td>–2 against water- or cold-based effects</td></tr><tr><td>Water</td><td>–2 against fire-based effects</td></tr></tbody></table>
  In addition to the powers described above, each specific ring gives its wearer the following abilities according to its kind.
  ### Ring of Elemental Command (Air)
  This ring appears to be a _ring of feather falling_ until a certain condition is met to activate its full potential. It must be reactivated each time a new wearer acquires it.
  ### Ring of Elemental Command (Earth)
  This ring appears to be a _ring of meld into stone_ (allowing the wearer to cast meld into stone at will) until the established condition is met.
  ### Ring of Elemental Command (Fire)
  This ring appears to be a _major ring of energy resistance_ (fire) until the established condition is met.
  ### Ring of Elemental Command (Water)
  This ring appears to be a _ring of water walking_ until the established condition is met."

Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can't attack the wearer, or even approach within 5 feet of her. If the wearer desires, she may forgo this protection and instead attempt to charm the elemental (as _[[spells/Charm Monster|charm monster]]_, Will DC 17 negates). If the charm attempt fails, however, absolute protection is lost and no further attempt at charming can be made.

Creatures from the plane to which the ring is attuned that attack the wearer take a –1 penalty on their attack rolls. The ring wearer makes applicable saving throws against the extraplanar creature's attacks with a +2 _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ bonus. She gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack rolls against such creatures. Any weapons he uses bypasses the _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_ of such creatures, regardless of any qualities the weapon may or may not have.

The wearer of the ring is able to converse with creatures from the plane to which her ring is attuned. These creatures recognize that she wears the ring, and show a healthy respect for the wearer if their alignments are similar.
