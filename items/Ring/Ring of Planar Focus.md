Slot: "Ring"
Caster level: "15"
Aura: "strong divination"
Description: |
  "This large silver ring has a massive setting for a cloudy white crystal about an inch in diameter. Once per week as a standard action, the wearer can tap the ring with a forked rod attuned to a specific plane (the focus for a _plane shift_ spell). When tapped, the crystal transforms into a rough topographical map of the plane in question for 1 minute. The wearer can manipulate the crystal to focus on a single specific location within the plane, although the topographical elements remain rough and display only large or well-known features around the desired location. If the wearer has been to that location personally, she can focus the crystal on the location in 1 full round. Otherwise, she can attempt a DC 15 Knowledge (planes) check to focus on a location of her choice as a full-round action. This location must be a public or well-known area, such as a public plaza in the Common Quarter in the City of Brass. Obscure locations (such as Calistria's private Garden of Hidden Fruits) or locations controlled by a divinity cannot be focused on—in all cases, the GM has final say on whether a region can be focused upon.
  If the wearer casts _plane shift_ to travel to the focused location while the map is active, she arrives without error at the site, rather than 5d% miles away. Once a _ring of planar focus_ is used to aid a casting of _plane shift_, it becomes inactive for 24 hours."
