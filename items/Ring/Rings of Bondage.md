Title: "Rings of Bondage"
Type: "Ring"
Price: "18200 gp"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Ring"
Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate enchantment"
Description: |
  "These rings are forged in pairs, establishing a mental connection between the two creatures wearing them, designating one as the master and the other as the servant. The listed and cost are for both rings. Creatures wearing _rings of bondage_ can understand one another's speech. The wearer of the master ring gains a +6 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks against the servant and is continuously aware of the location and general condition of the wearer of the servant ring, as the _status_ spell.
  In addition, once per day, the wearer of the master ring of bondage can impose her will upon the wearer of the servant ring, compelling the servant to perform or refrain from an action as if subjected to a _lesser geas_ (Will DC 16 negates). Alternatively, this effect can be executed as a contract between the wearers: as long as the wearer of the master ring is a valid target for _lesser geas_, she can accept a _lesser geas_ dictated by the wearer of the servant ring. In such an event, neither wearer is entitled to a saving throw and both are compelled by the _lesser geas_ to fulfill the terms of the agreement. If the wearer of the servant ring is unwilling to agree to such a contract, she can always select a _lesser geas_ such as "remove the _lesser geas_ from me."
  As long as a _lesser geas_ imposed by a _ring of bondage_ remains in effect, neither ring can be removed. If either ring is destroyed, the effects of the _lesser geas_ remain in place, but the surviving ring can't create a new _lesser geas_ until the missing ring is repaired or replaced. If a mutual _lesser geas_ is accepted and one _lesser geas_ is ended, both _lesser geas_ effects end simultaneously.
  A target can have a _ring of bondage_ forcibly placed on its finger, but only if that creature is helpless."

### Description

These rings are forged in pairs, establishing a mental connection between the two creatures wearing them, designating one as the master and the other as the servant. The listed and cost are for both rings. Creatures wearing _[[items/Ring/Rings of Bondage|rings of bondage]]_ can understand one another's speech. The wearer of the master ring gains a +6 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks against the servant and is continuously aware of the location and general condition of the wearer of the servant ring, as the _[[spells/Status|status]]_ spell.

In addition, once per day, the wearer of the master ring of bondage can impose her will upon the wearer of the servant ring, compelling the servant to perform or refrain from an action as if subjected to a lesser geas (Will DC 16 negates). Alternatively, this effect can be executed as a contract between the wearers: as long as the wearer of the master ring is a valid target for lesser geas, she can accept a lesser geas dictated by the wearer of the servant ring. In such an event, neither wearer is entitled to a saving throw and both are compelled by the lesser geas to fulfill the terms of the agreement. If the wearer of the servant ring is unwilling to agree to such a contract, she can always select a lesser geas such as "remove the lesser geas from me."

As long as a lesser geas imposed by a ring of bondage remains in effect, neither ring can be removed. If either ring is destroyed, the effects of the lesser geas remain in place, but the surviving ring can't create a new lesser geas until the missing ring is repaired or replaced. If a mutual lesser geas is accepted and one lesser geas is ended, both lesser geas effects end simultaneously.

A target can have a ring of bondage forcibly placed on its finger, but only if that creature is _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_.
