Title: "Contract Rings"
Type: "Ring"
Price: "8500 gp"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Ring"
Caster level: "7"
Aura: "moderate enchantment"
Description: |
  "_Contract rings_ are crafted in pairs (the price is for both rings), establishing a connection between the wearers. Each wearer must wear their ring for 24 hours before they begin to work. _Contract rings_ grant a +10 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks made against the other wearer, and creatures wearing linked _contract rings_ can understand each other's language.
  Once per day, _Contract rings_ can seal a contract. The two wearers join hands and willingly state what each is agreeing to. Once both agree, each wearer accepts a _lesser geas_ (no save) to fulfill the terms of the contract. This function does not occur if either character is under a mind-affecting effect or threat that forces her agreement. This compulsion lasts 7 days, starting immediately. While the _lesser geas_ remains in effect, neither wearer can remove her ring, and neither ring can establish another _lesser geas_. If either ring is destroyed, the effects of any active _lesser geas_ remain for both creatures, but the surviving ring becomes nonfunctional once the _lesser geas_ expires until the missing ring is repaired or replaced. If one wearer's _lesser geas_ is broken, the other wearer's is removed."

### Description

_[[items/Ring/Contract Rings|Contract rings]]_ are crafted in pairs (the price is for both rings), establishing a connection between the wearers. Each wearer must wear their ring for 24 hours before they begin to work. _Contract rings_ grant a +10 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks made against the other wearer, and creatures wearing linked _contract rings_ can understand each other's language.

Once per day, _Contract rings_ can seal a contract. The two wearers join hands and willingly state what each is agreeing to. Once both agree, each wearer accepts a lesser geas (no save) to fulfill the terms of the contract. This function does not occur if either character is under a mind-affecting effect or threat that forces her agreement. This compulsion lasts 7 days, starting immediately. While the lesser geas remains in effect, neither wearer can remove her ring, and neither ring can establish another lesser geas. If either ring is destroyed, the effects of any active lesser geas remain for both creatures, but the surviving ring becomes nonfunctional once the lesser geas expires until the missing ring is repaired or replaced. If one wearer's lesser geas is _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_, the other wearer's is removed.
