Description: |
  "This ring comes in four types: _ring of spell knowledge I_, _ring of spell knowledge II_, _ring of spell knowledge III_, and _ring of spell knowledge IV_. All of them are useful only to spontaneous arcane spellcasters. Through study, the wearer can gain the knowledge of a single spell in addition to those allotted by her class and level. A _ring of spell knowledge I_ can hold 1st-level spells only, a _ring of spell knowledge II_ 1st- or 2nd-level spells, a _ring of spell knowledge III_ spells of 3rd level or lower, and a _ring of spell knowledge IV_ up to 4th-level spells.
  A _ring of spell knowledge_ is only a storage space; the wearer must still encounter a written, active, or cast version of the spell and succeed at a DC 20 Spellcraft check to teach the spell to the ring. Thereafter, the arcane spellcaster may cast the spell as though she knew the spell and it appeared on her class' spell list.
  Arcane spells that do not appear on the wearer's class list are treated as one level higher for all purposes (storage and casting)."
