  "Three types of _rings of the beast_ exist; all three appear as yellowed bone carved in the shapes of wild beasts devouring their own tails. The type of beast depicted on each ring depends on the ring's nature, but could be a wolf (_ring of the relentless beast_), a rhinoceros (_ring of the savage beast_), or a tiger (_ring of the swift beast_). Once per day, a _ring of the beast_ can be activated as a standard action to unleash the primal spirit hidden inside even the most peaceful creatures. When the ring is activated, the wearer gains a bonus to a single physical attribute and a penalty to a single mental attribute for 10 minutes, as determined by the type of ring. A _ring of the relentless beast_ grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution and a –2 penalty to Charisma. A _ring of the savage beast_ grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and a –2 penalty to Intelligence. A _ring of the swift beast_ grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity and a –2 penalty to Wisdom. As long as the effects of this ring are active, the wearer also gains a +2 enhancement bonus to his natural armor bonus."
