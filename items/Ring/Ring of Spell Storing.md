Title: "Ring of Spell Storing"
Type: "Ring"
Price: "50000 gp"
Weight: "–"
Slot: "Ring"
Caster level: "9"
Aura: "moderate evocation"
Description: |
  "A _ring of spell storing_ contains up to 5 levels of spells (either divine or arcane, or even a mix of both spell types) that the wearer can cast. Each spell has a caster level equal to the minimum level needed to cast that spell. The user need not provide any material components or focus to cast the spell, and there is no arcane spell failure chance for wearing armor (because the ring wearer need not gesture). The activation time for the ring is the same as the casting time for the relevant spell, with a minimum of 1 standard action.
  For a randomly generated ring, treat it as a scroll to determine what spells are stored in it. If you roll a spell that would put the ring over the five-level limit, ignore that roll; the ring has no more spells in it.
  A spellcaster can cast any spells into the ring, so long as the total spell levels do not add up to more than 5. Metamagic versions of spells take up storage space equal to their spell level modified by the metamagic feat. A spellcaster can use a scroll to put a spell into the _minor ring of spell storing_.
  The ring magically imparts to the wearer the names of all spells currently stored within it."
