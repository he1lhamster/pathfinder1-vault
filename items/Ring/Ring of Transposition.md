Once per day, the wearer of the ring of transposition can speak a command word to exchange places with the creature wearing the bonded ring, which must be within 800 feet, as though using a dimension door spell against a willing target. In the process, the ring of transposition trades places with the ring on the other creature's hand, and the bond between the rings is broken. The bonding property of the _ring of transposition_ can be used as often as desired, breaking any existing bond each time it is used.
