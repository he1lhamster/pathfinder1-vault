##### Description

Vukodlaks spawn from the malignant

spirits of powerful, intelligent, _wolf_ like

creatures such as worgs, winter wolves,

or werewolves. Often they arise from such

creatures that—through desperation

or depravity—fed on undead f lesh

or drank the blood of a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vampiric|vampiric]]_

creature. Their blackened souls

arise after death, twisting their

bodies into monstrous shapes.

Like vampires, vukodlaks share

an insatiable thirst for blood.

Vukodlaks measure 8 feet long

and 6 feet tall at the shoulder, and

they weigh 1,000 pounds. A _vukodlak_ typically walks on

all fours, and from a distance can easily be mistaken for

a large, shaggy _horse_. However, it has a distinct _wolf_ like

muzzle filled with sharp canine teeth, as well as other

wolfish features. Vukodlaks possess monstrous strength,

making them ideal mounts for powerful undead masters

or other evil creatures. While serving as mounts, they keep

to all fours, and might easily be mistaken for worgs or

great fanged horses. Masters seeking to control vukodlaks

find the most success relying on _fear_ and intimidation,

as well as providing a constant source of blood for the

creature to feed upon. Vukodlaks share a natural kinship

with vampires and often serve them willingly.

Vukodlaks hunger for blood, gorging themselves rather

than saving victims to feed on later. When feeding, they can

prove difficult to _[[spells/Command|command]]_. Riders who are not careful in

their attempts to restrain a hungry _vukodlak_ risk having

their _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_ turn on them. While vukodlaks can go days

without feeding, they gradually become weaker if they do

not feed daily, and have difficulty operating on anything

other than pure instinct. Though intelligent, vukodlaks

rarely think or plan ahead, instead focusing on feeding or

obeying their masters’ commands.

Vukodlaks without masters often form small packs.

These packs annihilate all life in entire areas, overfeeding

until destroyed or forced to move on. Vukodlaks hate

sunlight and hunt only at night, making their lairs in

deep caves or ruins. They don’t care for treasure; anything

of worth found in a _vukodlak_ lair is simply something its

latest victim was carrying that the beast couldn’t eat.

Although vukodlaks don’t appear undead at first

glance, any creature that wounds one or

finds a _vukodlak_ corpse can tell they’re

not living creatures—their bodies

being largely hollow, filled with the

rotten, stinking remains of organs

that ceased functioning long ago.
