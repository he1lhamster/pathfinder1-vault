  Extending Jaw (Ex): A cordulegaster can extend its jaws with blinding speed. The
    reach of its primary bite attack is 15 feet. During the surprise round, it gains
    a +4 bonus on attack rolls to bite any flat-footed creature.
  Gnaw (Ex): If a cordulegaster begins a round with a foe grappled in its jaws, it
    automatically deals bite damage as a standard action or part of a full-round action.
    A cordulegaster has a second set of jaws that shred captured food, allowing it
    to make a secondary bite attack (+8 attack, 1d8+3) against a foe it is currently
    grappling.
  Jet (Ex): A cordulegaster can expand chambers within its abdomen to rapidly draw
    in and expel water, enabling it to swim forward or backward at a speed of 60 feet
    as a fullround action. It must move in a straight line while jetting, and does
    not provoke attacks of opportunity when it does so. The cordulegaster can use
    this ability to charge.
  Powerful Bite (Ex): A cordulegaster applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to
    its primary bite damage.
  Stygian Bite (Su): |-
    A cordulegaster's body is infused with the memory-robbing powers of the River Styx. Any creature bitten by a cordulegaster takes 1d4 points of Intelligence damage and a cumulative -2 penalty on all Craft, Knowledge, and Profession checks for 24 hours. A successful saving throw (Will DC 13) reduces the Intelligence damage to 1 point and eliminates the skill check penalty. A heal or restoration spell restores the lost memories immediately. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

    Strangely reminiscent of dragonfly nymphs, cordulegasters are monstrous creations that inhabit the waterways of the River Styx. Like hydrodaemons, cordulegasters can survive prolonged exposure to the Styx's tainted waters, where they lurk near the river's edge and lie in wait for prey to wander close. A cordulegaster's mouth comprises a prehensile, extendable lower jaw and a secondary inner set of mandibles. Its lower jaw folds under its head as the cordulegaster rests, cupping over the mandibles like a mask of interlocking, irregular teeth. When a cordulegaster attacks, its jaws separate and shoot forward to grasp its prey, pulling it closer so the mandibles can begin to shred and devour its unlucky victim's flesh.

    Jagged russet plates cover the cordulegaster's body, camouflaging the creature by mimicking natural rock formations found in Abadd0n's waterways. Serrated edges line its protective chitin and run down the creature's back, making it dangerous to grab or hold (and sparing it from larger predators). These serrated edges allow its lashing tail to open deep, jagged wounds with every blow. A typical cordulegaster can grow up to 12 feet long and 7 feet tall at the head, and can weigh as much as 2,000 pounds.

**Extending Jaw (Ex)** A _cordulegaster_ can extend its jaws with _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Blinding|blinding]]_ speed. The reach of its primary bite attack is 15 feet. During the surprise round, it gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls to bite any _flat-footed_ creature.

**Gnaw (Ex)** If a _cordulegaster_ begins a round with a foe _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ in its jaws, it automatically deals bite damage as a standard action or part of a full-round action. A _cordulegaster_ has a second set of jaws that shred captured food, allowing it to make a secondary bite attack (+8 attack, 1d8+3) against a foe it is currently grappling.

**_Jet_ (Ex)** A _cordulegaster_ can expand chambers within its abdomen to rapidly draw in and expel water, enabling it to swim forward or backward at a speed of 60 feet as a fullround action. It must move in a straight line while jetting, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity when it does so. The _cordulegaster_ can use this ability to charge.

**Powerful Bite (Ex)** A _cordulegaster_ applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to its primary bite damage.
**Stygian Bite (Su)** A _cordulegaster_’s body is infused with the memory-robbing powers of the River Styx.

A _cordulegaster_’s mouth comprises a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Prehensile|prehensile]]_, extendable lower jaw and a secondary inner set of mandibles. Its lower jaw folds under its head as the _cordulegaster_ rests, cupping over the mandibles like a _[[items/Mundane/Mask|mask]]_ of interlocking, irregular teeth. When a _cordulegaster_ attacks, its jaws separate and shoot forward to _[[spells/Grasp|grasp]]_ its prey, pulling it closer so the mandibles can begin to shred and devour its unlucky victim’s flesh.
