  Possession (Su): An ataxian does not require a receptacle to use its magic jar spell-like
    ability. When using this ability on the Material Plane, its body becomes ethereal
    for the duration. When the ataxian leaves its host, the host must succeed at a
    DC 14 Will save or fall asleep for 1d3 minutes. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Staggered (Ex): Any creature struck by an ataxian's ray attack must succeed at a
    DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or be staggered for 1d4 rounds. This is a poison
    effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Staggering Drunk (Ex): For each alcoholic drink an ataxian has consumed in the past
    hour, it gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and takes a -1 penalty on all attack rolls,
    saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks, to a maximum of +4 and -4, respectively.
    These effects wear off after 1 hour.
  Ray (Su): An ataxian can fire a ray of cold up to 30 feet with no range increment.
desc_long: |-
  An ataxian is a rowdy, boisterous, and good-natured servitor of Cayden Cailean. It has an instinct for finding taverns, whether in a crowded city or rural farmland. When it finds these drinking holes, it's always able to find people willing to buy it drinks. An ataxian embodies all the positive stereotypes of a happy, fun drunk.

  Courageous despite its tiny, frail body, an ataxian is always ready to stand up for the underdog, and it isn't afraid to take the first swing against a bully. However, an ataxian much prefers to use its magic to make fools out of thugs-or, better yet, turn potential adversaries into drinking buddies.

  Ataxians love to possess worshipers of the Drunken Hero and experience life in an “enormous” body, and they seize the chance whenever they can. Many tales of a drunken peasant single-handedly defeating a gang of ruffians can be attributed to the unexpected intervention of one of these servitors. Ataxians enjoy singing bawdy songs, carousing with light-hearted folk, and spreading good cheer.

  Ataxians typically measure about 1-1/2 feet tall and weigh about 4 pounds.
