  When a soul is not allowed to rest due to some great injustice, either real or perceived, it sometimes comes back as a ghost. Such beings are in eternal anguish, lacking in substance and unable to set things right. Although ghosts can be any alignment, the majority cling to the living world out of a powerful sense of rage and hatred, and as a result are chaotic evil-even the ghost of a good or lawful creature can become hateful and cruel in its afterlife.

  More than most of the monsters in this book, a ghost benefits from a strong and detailed backstory. Why did this character become a ghost? What are the legends surrounding the ghost? An encounter with a ghost should never happen completely out of the blue-there are plenty of other incorporeal undead like wraiths and spectres to fill that role. A proper encounter with a ghost should be a climactic scene after a lengthy period of tension building with lesser minions or manifestations of the undead spirit. The sample ghost above is that of a human princess who was murdered by an unfaithful lover-after she confronted him, he murdered her by wrapping her in chains and throwing her into the castle well, where she drowned. The ghost's abilities were selected to fit this backstory, and it shows how potent a villain you can create with a simple NPC class. Applying the template to creatures with class levels or creatures with significant racial abilities can create even more powerful ghosts.

  When a ghost is created, it retains incorporeal “copies” of any items that it particularly valued in life (provided the originals are not in another creature's possession). The equipment works normally for the ghost but passes harmlessly through material objects or creatures. A weapon of +1 or better magical enhancement, however, can harm material creatures, but any such attack deals only half as much damage (50%) unless it is a ghost touch weapon. A ghost can use shields or armor only if they have the ghost touch quality.

  The original items remain behind, just as the ghost's physical remains do. If another creature seizes the original, the incorporeal copy fades away. This loss invariably angers the ghost, who stops at nothing to return the item to its original resting place (and thus regain the item's use).

##### Description

When a soul is not allowed to rest due to some great injustice, either real or perceived, it sometimes comes back as a _ghost_. Such beings are in eternal anguish, lacking in substance and unable to set things right. Although ghosts can be any alignment, the majority cling to the living world out of a powerful sense of _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ and hatred, and as a result are chaotic evil—even the _ghost_ of a good or lawful creature can become hateful and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_ in its afterlife.

More than most of the monsters in this book, a _ghost_ benefits from a strong and detailed backstory. Why did this character become a _ghost_? What are the legends surrounding the _ghost_? An encounter with a _ghost_ should never happen completely out of the blue—there are plenty of other _incorporeal_ undead like wraiths and spectres to fill that role. A proper encounter with a _ghost_ should be a climactic scene after a lengthy period of tension building with lesser minions or manifestations of the undead spirit. The sample _ghost_ above is that of a human _[[npcs/Princess|princess]]_ who was murdered by an unfaithful lover—after she confronted him, he murdered her by wrapping her in chains and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Throwing|throwing]]_ her into the castle well, where she drowned. The _ghost_’s abilities were selected to fit this backstory, and it shows how _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ a villain you can create with a simple NPC class. Applying the template to creatures with class levels or creatures with significant racial abilities can create even more powerful ghosts.

When a _ghost_ is created, it retains _incorporeal_ “copies” of any items that it particularly valued in life (provided the originals are not in another creature’s _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_). The equipment works normally for the _ghost_ but passes harmlessly through material objects or creatures. A weapon of +1 or better magical enhancement, however, can _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ material creatures, but any such attack deals only half as much damage (50%) unless it is a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]]_ weapon. A _ghost_ can use shields or armor only if they have the _ghost touch_ quality.

The original items remain behind, just as the _ghost_’s physical remains do. If another creature seizes the original, the _incorporeal_ copy fades away. This loss invariably angers the _ghost_, who stops at nothing to return the item to its original resting place (and thus regain the item’s use).
