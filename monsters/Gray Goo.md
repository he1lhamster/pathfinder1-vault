  Dismantle (Ex): Creatures damaged by a gray goo must succeed at a DC 19 Reflex save
    or a random piece of their equipment takes the same amount of damage, determined
    as though the target rolled a natural 1 on a saving throw, using the rules for
    items surviving after a saving throw. In addition, unattended objects in the area
    of a gray goo take damage if the swarm chooses to harm them. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Dispersion (Ex): As an immediate action, a gray goo can disperse, spreading itself
    across a cube-shaped area 30 feet on a side. While dispersed, the goo deals no
    damage and can't use its other special abilities until it reforms. A dispersed
    gray goo can hide in plain sight (as a ranger in her favored terrain) with a +10
    bonus on its Stealth checks and doesn't take additional damage from area effects
    for being a swarm. It takes 2 rounds for a dispersed gray goo to reform.
  Infest (Ex): As a standard action, a gray goo can infest a Medium or larger creature
    (Fortitude DC 21 negates), including constructs and undead. The gray goo moves
    inside the creature's body, dealing double its normal damage to its host each
    round. It can't use its dismantle ability while infesting a creature. A host reduced
    to 0 hit points while infested by a gray goo is reduced to dust and destroyed
    (similar to disintegrate). A gray goo infesting a host can be expelled by any
    effect that cures disease, with a disease save equal to this ability's DC. The
    save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
desc_long: Swarms of weaponized nanites-microscopic mechanical constructs designed
  to work in large groups to perform varied tasks-reduce anything in their path to
  wisps of dust. Called “gray goo” by those who don't understand the true nature of
  the creature's components, some of these horrific swarms were activated as weapons
  of mass destruction. Others were originally benign, intended to enhance crops and
  clean them of pests or combat diseases, but malfunctioned and abandoned their programming.
  Nanites have limited intelligence and potentially respond to commands. Such controlled
  swarms are capable of relatively complex decision making, and they might spare the
  treasure their victims carry, for instance, allowing their masters to better loot
  the bodies.

##### Description

Swarms of weaponized nanites—microscopic mechanical constructs designed to work in large groups to perform varied tasks—reduce anything in their path to wisps of dust. _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|Called]]_ “_gray goo_” by those who don’t understand the true nature of the creature’s components, some of these horrific swarms were activated as weapons of mass _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_. Others were originally benign, intended to enhance crops and clean them of pests or combat diseases, but malfunctioned and abandoned their programming. Nanites have limited intelligence and potentially respond to commands. Such controlled swarms are capable of relatively complex decision making, and they might spare the treasure their victims carry, for instance, allowing their masters to better loot the bodies.
