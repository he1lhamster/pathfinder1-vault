special_abilities:
  Atomizer (Ex): As a full-round action once every 3 rounds, a juggernaut robot can
    fire a ray from its eye as a ranged touch attack. On a hit, the ray deals 15d6
    points of damage. When used against an object, the atomizer disintegrates as much
    as a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. A creature or object that succeeds at a
    DC 21 Fortitude save instead takes only 5d6 points of damage. Any creature reduced
    to 0 or fewer hit points by this attack is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind
    only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected.
    The save DC is Intelligence-based.
  Charge Fist (Ex): A juggernaut robot can charge its oversized fists with electricity
    as a free action, causing its slam attacks to deal 1d6 points of electricity damage.
    On a critical hit, a charged strike explodes with electric energy, dealing an
    additional 1d10 points of electricity damage. This electricity doesn't harm the
    juggernaut.
  Combined Arms (Ex): When taking a full-attack action, a juggernaut robot can attack
    with its melee and ranged integrated weapons simultaneously.
  Electromagnetic Pulse (Ex): Once per day as a standard action, a juggernaut robot
    can unleash an electromagnetic pulse in a 20- foot radius that bypasses any active
    force fields (or similar effects) and deals 6d6 points of electricity damage to
    any robots or creatures with cybernetic implants. This effect doesn't harm the
    juggernaut robot itself or other living creatures. Creatures affected by this
    attack that succeed at a DC 21 Reflex save take only half the normal amount of
    damage. Any technological item within this radius is drained of 1d6 charges unless
    the item succeeds at a DC 21 Reflex save. The save DCs are Intelligence-based.
  Force Field (Ex): A juggernaut robot is sheathed in a thin layer of shimmering energy
    that grants it 75 bonus hit points. All damage dealt to a juggernaut with an active
    force field is deducted from these hit points first. As long as the force field
    is active, the juggernaut is immune to critical hits. A juggernaut's force field
    has fast healing 10, but once these bonus hit points are reduced to 0, the force
    field shuts down and does not reactivate for 24 hours.
  Integrated Heavy Lasers (Ex): A juggernaut robot has a heavy laser rifle built into
    each of its arms. Each weapon has a range of 150 feet and deals 4d10 points of
    fire damage. Each can fire once per round in a burst of shots that attacks all
    creatures in a line. This line starts from any corner of the robot's space and
    extends to the limit of the weapon's range or until it strikes a barrier it can't
    penetrate. The robot must make a separate attack roll against each creature in
    the line, and each creature in the line can be attacked with only one shot from
    each burst. Each attack roll takes a -2 penalty, and its damage can't be modified
    by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as Vital Strike. Invisible
    creatures are immune to damage caused by a laser weapon. Fog, smoke, and other
    clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks. Darkness (magical
    or otherwise) has no effect on lasers other than providing concealment. Roll to
    confirm each attack roll that threatens a critical hit separately.
  Targeting Array (Ex): Juggernaut robots see invisible creatures or objects as if
    they were visible. In addition, because of their complex array of sensors, juggernauts
    suffer no miss chance if a target has concealment, and reduce the miss chance
    from total concealment to 20%.
  Vicious Trample (Ex): A juggernaut robot's massive steel feet deal 6d6+19 points
    of damage on a successful trample attack.
desc_long: Easily the rarest of all robots in Numeria, these metallic monstrosities
  wreak havoc upon those who trespass upon the remnants of the strange vessel that
  crashed into Golarion's crust eons ago. The original reasons behind the creation
  of such titanic constructs remains a mystery. However, the Technic League quickly
  surmised that these metal giants excelled at rendering other Numerian technology
  inert, which may give clues to the constructs' purpose. Wrought from a strange metallic
  alloy similar to iron and containing bizarre electronics and delicate sensors, the
  juggernaut rises to a height of 50 feet and weighs well over 100 tons.
