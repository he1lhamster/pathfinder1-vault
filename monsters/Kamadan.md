  Breath Weapon (Su): A kamadan can exhale a cone of gas that makes living creatures
    fall asleep for 5 minutes (Fortitude DC 15 negates). Slapping or wounding awakens
    a creature put to sleep by this attack, but normal noise does not. This is a sleep
    effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Snakes (Ex): A kamadan's snakes attack simultaneously; this is always a secondary
    attack.
desc_long: |-
  Kamadans are wicked hunters that enjoy stalking and toying with prey, especially when their quarry is relatively intelligent. When a kamadan attacks, it first uses its soporific breath, then pounces on any targets that remain awake. Kamadans stand about 3 feet at the shoulder, about 9 feet long and weighing up to 500 pounds.

  Although kamadans are certainly magical creatures, they share many psychological and sociological traits with other big cats. Even when hunting alone to avoid competition, a kamadan is often a member of a larger pride. In areas where wildlife or natives are more powerful, kamadan packs are more likely to hunt as a unit.

  Kamadans prefer underground lairs, but settle for rocky outcroppings or dens inside brambles or other thick bushes, and they use their snakes to manipulate the bones and baubles of their prey into decorative arrangements. Occasionally, a kamadan shares its lair with another creature, but only if the other creature is more powerful or plies the kamadan regularly with tributes of food and treasure.

  Though the above statistics represent the most common breed of kamadan, two rarer but more dangerous variants are detailed in brief below.

  Dusk Kamadan (CR +1): A dusk kamadan has midnight black fur and snakes bearing black and red ring patterns on their bodies. A dusk kamadan has the advanced creature template, and its snakes have a poisonous bite: Snakes-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.

  Polar Kamadan (CR +2): A polar kamadan has white fur with black spots like a snow leopard. Its snakes are furred as well. A polar kamadan has the advanced creature template and batlike wings that grant it a fly speed of 60 ft. (average). The breath weapon of a polar kamadan is particularly cold-those who succumb to it also suffer 1d4 points of Dexterity damage from numbness.

##### Description

Kamadans are wicked hunters that enjoy _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Stalking|stalking]]_ and toying with prey, especially when their quarry is relatively intelligent. When a _kamadan_ attacks, it first uses its soporific breath, then pounces on any targets that remain awake. Kamadans stand about 3 feet at the shoulder, about 9 feet long and weighing up to 500 pounds.

Although kamadans are certainly magical creatures, they share many psychological and sociological traits with other big cats. Even when hunting alone to avoid competition, a _kamadan_ is often a member of a larger pride. In areas where wildlife or natives are more powerful, _kamadan_ packs are more likely to hunt as a unit.

Kamadans prefer underground lairs, but settle for rocky outcroppings or dens inside brambles or other thick bushes, and they use their snakes to manipulate the bones and baubles of their prey into decorative arrangements. Occasionally, a _kamadan_ shares its lair with another creature, but only if the other creature is more powerful or plies the _kamadan_ regularly with tributes of food and treasure.

Though the above statistics represent the most common breed of _kamadan_, two rarer but more dangerous variants are detailed in brief below.
