    a ranged attack roll of +5 when using telekinesis to hurl objects or creatures,
    and can use the ability on objects weighing up to 50 pounds. If a domovoi attempts
    to hurl a creature with this ability, that creature can resist the effect with
    a successful DC 14 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.

  butter and mending clothes, but mostly protect the home from intruders and misfortune.
  These helpful fey can also tell the fate of the family they protect, but grow annoyed
  when asked to do so too often. A domovoi appears as small, old man no more than
  2 feet tall, covered in hair and with a long, shaggy beard.
