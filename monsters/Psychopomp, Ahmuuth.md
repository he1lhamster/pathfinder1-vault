  Animated Shield (Su): An ahmuuth's gravestones defend the it in a manner similar
    to an animated shield but without a limited duration (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook
    462). If the stones leave the psychopomp's square or the ahmuuth is slain, they
    become inert stone.
  Death's Dagger (Su): An ahmuuth's dagger is treated as a +1 returning undead-bane
    dagger. It loses this ability if it is held by anyone other than the ahmuuth,
    and regains it once returned.
  Ectoplasmic Focus (Su): An ahmuuth's spells and spell-like abilities have their
    full effect against incorporeal or ethereal creatures.
desc_long: An ahmuuth is a servitor of Pharasma who is responsible for helping mortals
  destroy undead and dispatch renegade souls evading the goddess's judgment. Unlike
  morrigna psychopomps (Bestiary 4 219), who hunt lost or corrupted souls on their
  own, ahmuuths work with mortal worshipers of Pharasma and try to usher creatures
  like ghosts to peaceable final ends-when they can. When they can't, they have no
  qualms about forcing wayward spirts to face their goddess's judgement. An ahmuuth
  looks like a humanoid wearing an owl mask, and is always accompanied by floating
  gravestone shards that act as a shield. Like owls, ahmuuths are silent stalkers,
  revealing themselves only at the moment of attack. Ahmuuths stand just over 6 feet
  tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds.
