### Special Abilities

**Creature of the Night (Su)** A _[[monsters/Mngwa|mngwa]]_ exists

only at night, appearing at sunset and

fading away at sunrise. It receives the

benefit of a _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ spell (CL 15th) each

night when it reappears. A _mngwa_’s

connection to _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_ is so strong

that it has _sunlight powerlessness_ even

within the effects of a _daylight_ spell.

However, a _daylight_ spell that affects a

_mngwa_ loses 10 minutes of duration

for each round it affects a _mngwa_

in this way.

**Focus of Hate (Su)** A _mngwa_ comes into being to punish a hated

creature or group of creatures, and survives only as long as

its focus of hate exists. The _mngwa_ fades away permanently

if its focus of hate dies (or if all members of the group die). A

_mngwa_ knows the direction and general distance to its focus

of hate (or the nearest member in the case of a group). This

sense can be blocked by any effect that blocks _[[spells/Scrying|scrying]]_. While

its focus of hate exists, a _mngwa_ destroyed through violence

fades away and reappears fully restored in 1d4+1 days. The

only way to permanently destroy a _mngwa_ is to appease the

spirits responsible for its creation—typically by killing its focus

of hate or redressing the wrong that angered the spirits.

**Jungle Stealth (Ex)** A _mngwa_ in forest terrain can move at full

speed using the Stealth skill without penalty.

**Murderous Claws (Ex)** A _mngwa_ deals an additional 1d6 points

of _bleed_ damage with its claw and _rake_ attacks, and each

subsequent successful claw and _rake_ attack increases the

amount of _bleed_ damage by 1 (up to a maximum of 1d6+7

points of _bleed_ damage). A successful DC 20 _Heal_ check or

the application of any magical healing stops the bleeding.

##### Description

Mngwas are the incarnation of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Malevolent|malevolent]]_ jungle spirits,

driven by anger directed toward their focus of hate—a

specific creature, family, or community who has despoiled

the jungle or desecrated a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sacred|sacred]]_ site. A _mngwa_ exists only

between sunset and sunrise. Each day at sunset the _mngwa_

materializes near the spot on which it first manifested, and

each day at sunrise the _mngwa_ fades back into nothingness.

Legendary for their skill at evading hunters, mngwas

sometimes haunt a region for centuries, continuing to

stalk the members of large tribes or extended families

responsible for some ancient transgression.

Mngwas average 15 feet in length

and weigh 3,000 pounds.
