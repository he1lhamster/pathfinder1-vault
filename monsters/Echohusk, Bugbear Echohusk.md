  Echohusks are the walking corpses of creatures slain by powerful psychic attacks and animated by the mental energies that caused their deaths. The mind and soul of an echohusk are erased from its being, leaving nothing but the psychic echo of the creature that scoured its mind.

  Left unattended, echohusks do little other than attack creatures that disturb them. However, anyone who creates an echohusk possesses an innate mental link to the undead creature, and is able to command the echohusk to perform whatever gruesome tasks she desires.

  Echohusks are common in and around Geb, where death from the powerful mental attacks of psychic spellcasters-even liches-is an all too common occurrence. In such areas, echohusks are found in groups, obeying the commands of their dark masters. In the deep reaches of the underworld, where lost travelers or wayward patrols might encounter psychic horrors like neothelids, masterless echohusks are more common; the ancient and terrible creatures that happen to spawn them typically have little use for mindless servants.

  Many psychic creatures have attempted to perfect the technique of creating echohusks, but only the attacks of the incorporeal undead known as psychic stalkers (see page 45) can create echohusks without fail. The horrific nature of psychic stalkers is likely the reason for this phenomenon.

##### Description

Echohusks are the walking corpses of creatures slain by powerful _psychic_ attacks and _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Animated|animated]]_ by the mental energies that caused their deaths. The mind and soul of an echohusk are erased from its being, leaving nothing but the _psychic_ _[[spells/Echo|echo]]_ of the creature that scoured its mind.

Left unattended, echohusks do little other than attack creatures that disturb them. However, anyone who creates an echohusk possesses an innate mental link to the undead creature, and is able to _[[spells/Command|command]]_ the echohusk to perform whatever gruesome tasks she desires.

Echohusks are common in and around Geb, where death from the powerful mental attacks of _psychic_ spellcasters—even liches—is an all too common occurrence. In such areas, echohusks are found in groups, obeying the commands of their dark masters. In the deep reaches of the underworld, where lost travelers or wayward patrols might encounter _psychic_ horrors like neothelids, masterless echohusks are more common; the ancient and terrible creatures that happen to spawn them typically have little use for mindless servants.

Many _psychic_ creatures have attempted to perfect the technique of creating echohusks, but only the attacks of the _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ undead known as _psychic_ stalkers (see page 45) can create echohusks without fail. The horrific nature of _psychic_ stalkers is likely the reason for this phenomenon.
