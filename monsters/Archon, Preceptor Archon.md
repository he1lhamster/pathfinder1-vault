# Archon, Preceptor Archon
This creature resembles a _[[monsters/Tengu|tengu]]_, save for its eyes’ golden glow. Its immaculate white robes contrast starkly with its black feathers, and its willow staff sheds a pale light.

### Special Abilities

**_Psychic_ Ambush (Sp)** A preceptor archon can conceal his physical form when he assaults a foe’s mind. When a preceptor archon uses _instigate _psychic_ duel_ while _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ from his spell-like ability, the attack does not end the _invisibility_ effect. All other forms of attack end the effect normally. The preceptor’s psyche enters the binary mindscape visible (although he can assume a mental _[[items/Mundane/Mask|mask]]_).

##### Description

Preceptor archons are the celestial host’s interventionists. Their true forms resemble humanoid ravens with glowing eyes, garbed in pure white robes trimmed in gold, but they can assume other guises that better serve their missions.

Preceptors attempt to guide individuals in crisis or on the cusp of life-altering decisions. Typically, they first observe their charges, using magic to understand the personal history involved, then use this information to create a detailed, immersive mindscape designed to broaden perspectives. They use this technique to guide a troubled soul through her past, present, and potentially dire future and to demonstrate to the despairing how much worse life would be without them. Preceptors often visit or send messages to prospective charges both to warn them and also to gain their trust or curiosity. These archons don’t force a specific course of action, but rather help those in their care see past difficult choices.
