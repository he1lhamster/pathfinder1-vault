desc_long: |-
  A mandragora rises spontaneously from a mandrake root that has drawn nutrition from the corpse or ichor of a demon. A typical mandragora stands at just over 3 feet tall and only weighs 30 pounds. However, its size hides the creature's fantastic strength and brutality. When a mandragora attacks, its fingers grow into whipping, thorny vines nearly 10 feet long, with which it makes its slam attacks.

  A mandragora rarely strays far from its lair amid tangled roots or vines, but when it encounters any other creature, it attacks regardless of the odds. However, a mandragora can usually recognize druids and does not attack them or their animal companions unless they attack it first. It has no qualms about attacking a druid's allies.

  When mandragora poison is mixed with its thick, gooey, sap-like blood and 1,000 gp worth of alchemical reagents, the resulting fluid can be used as a focus for the scrying spell. The fluid only lasts for the duration of the spell's casting time and resulting effects but the subject of the spell takes a -4 penalty on the save to resist it.

  A mandrake root that is growing on or near a demon's corpse or ichor has a 2% chance of awakening as a mandragora within a day of first absorbing the tainted material. A creature that wants to create a mandragora can do so with alchemy; the process requires a day of work, a mandrake root, several pints of ichor or the body of a demon of CR 6 or above, and a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check. The newly created mandragora is hostile, even to its creator.

##### Description

A _mandragora_ rises spontaneously from a mandrake _[[spells/Root|root]]_ that has drawn nutrition from the corpse or ichor of a demon. A typical _mandragora_ stands at just over 3 feet tall and only weighs 30 pounds. However, its size hides the creature’s fantastic strength and brutality. When a _mandragora_ attacks, its fingers grow into whipping, thorny vines nearly 10 feet long, with which it makes its slam attacks.

A _mandragora_ rarely strays far from its lair amid tangled roots or vines, but when it encounters any other creature, it attacks regardless of the odds. However, a _mandragora_ can usually recognize druids and does not attack them or their animal companions unless they attack it first. It has no qualms about attacking a _[[classes/Druid|druid]]_’s allies.

When _mandragora_ poison is mixed with its thick, gooey, sap-like blood and 1,000 gp worth of alchemical reagents, the resulting fluid can be used as a focus for the _[[spells/Scrying|scrying]]_ spell. The fluid only lasts for the duration of the spell’s casting time and resulting effects but the subject of the spell takes a –4 penalty on the save to resist it.

A mandrake _root_ that is _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Growing|growing]]_ on or near a demon’s corpse or ichor has a 2% chance of awakening as a _mandragora_ within a day of first absorbing the tainted material. A creature that wants to create a _mandragora_ can do so with alchemy; the process requires a day of work, a mandrake _root_, several pints of ichor or the body of a demon of CR 6 or above, and a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check. The newly created _mandragora_ is hostile, even to its creator.
