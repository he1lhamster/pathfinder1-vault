  Level Adjustment +2 (cohort)Special AbilitiesFast Healing (Ex) A cinder wolf heals 1 point of damage every round that it resists a point or more of fire damage, so long as it has at least 1 hit point. This fire must be from an external source, not from a cinder wolf's fiery bite.

  Fiery Body (Su) A cinderwolf inflicts 1d4 points of fire damage when it bites a foe in addition to the normal bite damage. In any round that the cinderwolf resists at least one point of fire damage, it gains fast healing 3.

  Trip (Ex) A cinder wolf that hits with a bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+3 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the cinder wolf.DescriptionVicious predators and tireless trackers, cinder wolves are a relentless threat to the travelers and native tribes who make the Cinderlands their home. Ravenous creatures that endlessly hunt to fuel their fiery metabolisms, cinder wolves attack nearly any creature, from well-armored horned spirestalkers and ember scorpions to Shoanti barbarians and even stone giant warriors. Fleet footed and fearsome in appearance, these tenacious pack hunters thrive amid the flames of the Cinderlands, their fiery bites and relentless hunger embodying the deadliness of the burning plains.

  An adult cinder wolf stands just over 3 feet tall and weighs up to 200 pounds. What little fur they have is often singed and black, but can also be ash-gray. Their eyes are frequently bloodshot red with yellow irises.
