### Special Abilities

**Droning Madness (Ex)** As a standard action, a wihsaak can

beat its wings in a way that creates a maddening droning

sound that numbs the mind of all intelligent creatures within

100 feet. Creatures within this area must succeed at a DC 16

Will save or become _[[conditions/Confused|confused]]_ for 1 round. The wihsaak can

maintain this effect in subsequent rounds as a move action.

This is a sonic mind-affecting effect, and the save DC is

Charisma-based.

**Look of _Fear_ (Su)** A creature affected by a wihsaak’s _[[universal monster rules/Gaze|gaze]]_ is

_[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 1d4 rounds.
**Swarmwalking (Su)** A wihsaak is immune to damage or

_[[universal monster rules/Distraction|distraction]]_ effects caused by swarms.

##### Description

Wihsaaks prey on the _fear_ of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Creeping|creeping]]_, crawling, and

buzzing insects. Instead of whispering from the shadows,

wihsaaks blatantly present their unnerving insectile

forms to frighten and demoralize humanoid mortals.

Wihsaaks use their _suggestion_ spell-like ability to coerce

victims into terrifying circumstances and make them

believe that their horrific actions are their own ideas.

Wihsaaks savor their targets’ _fear_, drawing it out whenever

possible. When facing a group of enemies, wihsaaks don’t

immediately attack foes affected by their _fear_ effects,

and instead try to frighten all possible enemies before

delivering the killing blows so as to properly season their

prey in terror. When these sahkils do finally attack, their

claws rip and tear f lesh as easily as paper.

Wihsaaks stand 7 feet tall, have a 5-foot wingspan, and

weigh around 170 pounds.
