  Stir Crazy (Su): A victim swallowed whole by a sentinel hut is trapped in a plain,
    10-foot-square room. A trapped creature is not considered grappled, and can move
    freely about the room. Every round, it is bombarded with a powerful psychic force
    that causes 1d2 points of Wisdom damage. To escape, the victim must deal damage
    on the sentinel hut's door (AC 15, 12 hp). Damage dealt to any part of the interior
    other than the door still adds to the damage dealt to the construct overall, but
    won't free the victim. If sufficient damage is dealt to the hut to destroy it
    (from without or within), the trapped creature is freed, but must succeed at a
    DC 22 Will save or be afflicted by insanity (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide
    250). Victims who break through the door from within are not subject to this latter
    effect.
desc_long: Though few have seen Baba Yaga's Dancing Hut and lived to tell the tale,
  many scholars believe that these bizarre constructs, created by the White Witches
  of Irrisen, were modeled after their mother's miraculous artifact. Used primarily
  as sentinels on Irrisen's borders, these quaint hovels on stilt-like legs surprise
  passersby when they move in an almost comical dancing strut.
