In basic shape and form they appear similar to their ancestors, but other characteristics reveal the creatures’ altered nature. Their fur and skin are much paler, often _[[spells/Shades|shades]]_ of blue, _[[monsters/Gray|gray]]_, or simply white, and it is not uncommon for parts of these creatures to be cloaked in frost, especially their jagged claws and shaggy hair.
