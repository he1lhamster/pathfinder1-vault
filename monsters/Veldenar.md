  Vacuum Attack (Ex): Three times per day as a standard action, a veldenar can suddenly
    open and expand its jaws, drawing anything within a 15-foot cone toward its mouth.
    Creatures caught in this area that are Large or smaller must succeed at a DC 18
    Reflex saving throw or be pulled into the veldenar's space, potentially provoking
    attacks of opportunity. Attacks of opportunity caused by this ability cannot be
    avoided with Acrobatics (though other attacks of opportunity, such as moving out
    of the veldenar's square, can be avoided as normal). The saving throw is Dexterity-based.
  Viscous Air (Su): Once per day as a free action, a veldenar can cause a 15-foot-radius
    sphere of air centered on its mouth to become incredibly dense. Gaseous creatures
    in this area must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw or be affected as
    if by a slow spell (CL 10th). Other corporeal creatures treat the area as difficult
    terrain. Unless consumed during the creature's vacuum attack (in which case the
    viscous air immediately dissipates), the viscous air remains for 10 rounds before
    dissipating. Veldenars are unaffected by the viscous air. Creatures can notice
    the region of altered air from a distance of up to 20 feet with a successful DC
    20 Perception check.
desc_long: |-
  Veldenars are ambush predators native to the Plane of Air. They have pale, almost clear, skin, four stubby leglike appendages, a tail like that of a fish, and six black-and-red eyes on their heads. Veldenars are naturally buoyant in air. They typically feed on gaseous creatures-especially belkers and mihstus-though veldenars attack most anything that gets too close.

   Veldenars hide invisibly in areas that are abundant with prey. When a meal gets close enough, the veldenar unleashes its cloud of viscous air, then opens its mouth. The sudden change in pressure draws the prey into its gullet to be digested. While veldenars are more than capable of eating humanoid creatures-and often do when such beings enter their hunting grounds-they favor gigantic insects and beings of elemental fire.

   A typical veldenar is around 17 feet long and weighs about 3,000 pounds.
