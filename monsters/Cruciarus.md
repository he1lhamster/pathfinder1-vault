  Pain Touch (Su): A cruciarus can attack twice per round with its incorporeal touch
    attack, dealing 8d6 points of damage on a hit as it causes wracking, agonizing
    pains to tear through the victim's body. This untyped damage penetrates all damage
    reduction, but does not harm undead. Whenever a creature is touched by a cruciarus
    (regardless of whether it takes damage or not), it must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude
    save or be staggered from the pain for 1 round. Creatures that are immune to pain
    effects are immune to a cruciarus's pain touch. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Tortured Gaze (Su): |-
    The method by which a cruciarus was tortured to death influences not only its appearance but also the effects of its gaze attack. Regardless of the actual effects, all cruciaruses' tortured gazes have a range of 30 feet, and the effects can be resisted with a successful DC 23 Fortitude save. The save DC is Charisma-based. Specific types of cruciaruses are listed below-those encountered in Kintargo during the events of “Breaking the Bones of Hell” are all starvation cruciaruses, formed from the souls of those who perished from doghousing over the course of the Adventure Path. Other forms of cruciaruses may exist beyond those detailed below, as society's capacity for torment knows few bounds.

    Burning: This cruciarus was tortured to death via fire. Its incorporeal body seems to smoke and burn, and smoldering raw brands glow on its ghostly body from where red-hot coals or branding irons were used to inflict pain. The cruciarus's gaze deals 6d6 points of fire damage (Fortitude DC 23 half). A creature that takes damage from this gaze becomes outlined as if by faerie fire for 1d4 rounds as it is wreathed in ghostly flames. This type of cruciarus can rise from the application of other forms of energy used to torture-a person frozen to death would result in a cruciarus that deals cold damage, while electrocution would bring about a cruciarus that deals electricity damage.

    Crushing: A cruciarus created from crushing endured incredible pressure that caused the breaking of bones or the rupturing of organs-being compressed under a slowly increasing pile of stones is one grisly example of this torment. The target of this cruciarus's gaze takes 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Fortitude DC 23 half) each round as its bones creak and snap and its body bruises horrifically. A creature that fails to save against this gaze effect is also treated as if grappled for 1 round.

    Dislocation: This cruciarus was subjected to tortures designed to dislocate victims' joints. These methods often involve mechanical devices such the rack and the strappado, but also include death via crucifixion and via hanging. The cruciarus's arms, legs, and sometimes even neck bend in unnatural directions. Its gaze causes the victim's limbs to stiffen, affecting the victim as if by a slow spell for 1 round on a failed saving throw. Every time a creature fails two consecutive saving throws against this gaze effect, it takes 2 points of Strength drain.

    Dismemberment: One, some, or all of the cruciarus's limbs were amputated during a long, drawn-out death-execution via beheading can cause a dismembered cruciarus as well. The creature's ghostly body bears the terrible wounds, with its dismembered parts obviously still in proper relation to each other but separated from the body by an inch or 2. The target of this cruciarus's gaze takes 6d6 points of slashing damage (Fortitude DC 23 half) each round as hideous wounds manifest on body parts analogous to those the undead lost. A creature that fails its saving throw against this gaze effect also takes 1d6 points of bleed damage.

    Drowning: This cruciarus experienced real or simulated drowning. Variations include dunking chairs, forced ingestion, and waterboarding. A cruciarus who died this way always appears soaking wet, constantly dripping water that fades moments after running off its ghostly frame. The target of a drowned cruciarus's gaze attack experiences the panic of suffocation or drowning (even if it is normally able to breathe underwater), and on a failed Fortitude save it cannot speak and becomes nauseated for 1 round. Every time a creature fails two consecutive saving throws against this gaze effect, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain.

    Impalement: One or more sharp objects perforated this cruciarus before death. The cruciarus's body still caries ghostly echoes of the spears, lances, or other weapons that impaled it. The target of this cruciarus's gaze takes 6d6 points of piercing damage (Fortitude DC 23 half) each round as ghostly blades pierce its flesh. A creature that fails to resist this effect is also staggered for 1 round from the pain.

    Starvation: This cruciarus expired from a form of torture that involved starvation or dehydration. The wretched spirit seems emaciated and gaunt. A creature subjected to this cruciarus's gaze attack suffers wracking pangs of hunger or thirst and takes 6d6 points of nonlethal damage (Fortitude DC 23 half). A creature that fails its saving throw against this gaze effect also becomes fatigued-or exhausted if already fatigued.

  Cruciaruses are also known as the tortured dead. These anguished, frightening creatures are the disembodied spirits of those who died while being tortured. A painful death is not enough to produce these undead; only prolonged and intentional torment, whether punitive or sadistic, gives rise to one.

  A cruciarus bears the unmistakable wounds of a torture victim. Curiously, the features of cruciaruses never quite match those of the creatures whose deaths spawn them. While most cruciaruses spawn from the souls of mortal humanoids, others could well arise from creatures that suffer enough torture-statistics for such cruciaruses are identical to those listed above, although changes to size (as in the case of tortured giants or dragons) may be necessary.

##### Description

Cruciaruses are also known as the tortured dead. These anguished, frightening creatures are the disembodied spirits of those who died while being tortured. A painful death is not enough to produce these undead; only prolonged and intentional torment, whether punitive or sadistic, gives rise to one.

A _cruciarus_ bears the unmistakable wounds of a torture victim. Curiously, the features of cruciaruses never quite match those of the creatures whose deaths spawn them. While most cruciaruses spawn from the souls of mortal humanoids, others could well arise from creatures that suffer enough torture—statistics for such cruciaruses are identical to those listed above, although changes to size (as in the case of tortured giants or dragons) may be necessary.
