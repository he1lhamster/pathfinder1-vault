  Dilating Strike (Ex): A time dimensional's attacks slow the flow of local time around
    its target. A creature hit by a time dimensional's slam attack must succeed at
    a DC 22 Will save or be affected by slow for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not it succeeds
    at the saving throw, a creature cannot be affected again by this ability for 1
    minute. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Omniobservant (Ex): A time dimensional has nearly perfect information about the
    passage of time in its vicinity. It always acts in the surprise round and its
    initiative roll is automatically a natural 20.
  Temporal Dilation (Ex): The area around a time dimensional slows the temporal passage
    of projectiles and spells. Creatures in this aura have concealment against ranged
    attacks. A time dimensional can dismiss or resume this aura as a free action.
  Time Mastery (Ex): As a living embodiment of time, a time dimensional is free from
    the typical constraints of time's flow. It is immune to haste, slow, and temporal
    stasis and can use any actions remaining on its turn after using dimension door.
    Whenever a creature within 60 feet of a time dimensional casts time stop, the
    time dimensional can act normally as if it had cast time stop itself for the same
    effective duration. As neither the time dimensional nor the caster is frozen in
    time with respect to the other, each can target and affect the other with attacks,
    spells, or other effects they create, though neither can affect frozen creatures
    for the duration of the time stop. This ability functions even if the time dimensional
    is flat-footed or unaware of its opponent.
  Timestream Knowledge (Ex): A time dimensional shares its own knowledge from all
    points in its personal timeline. This knowledge grants it a +5 insight bonus to
    AC and all-around vision. It treats all skills as class skills, gains a +10 insight
    bonus on all Knowledge checks, and can attempt any Knowledge check untrained.
desc_long: |-
  When an event or individual threatens the nature of causality or the flow of time, a portion of the Dimension of Time breaks away from the dimension's substance to act as a correcting agent. These beings do not name themselves, but they are called time dimensionals by extraplanar scholars. Time dimensionals travel across the Great Beyond to confront and neutralize threats to the timestream. In some cases, this involves the removal of a disruptive individual or item, while in other cases it simply means delaying events long enough for the flow of time to correct itself. In the event of egregious disruptions, several time dimensionals may work together in perfect synchronicity to preserve the timestream.

   The very existence of time dimensionals can disrupt the flow of normal time, so the Dimension of Time dispatches a time dimensional for only the exact duration required; furthermore, a time dimensional uses only the minimum amount of force necessary to fulfill its duties. As the exact nature of time is fickle and never completely known, those who devote their lives to the study of time are unsure as to which events trigger a time dimensional's appearance and which do not. Time dimensionals have appeared during seemingly mundane events, such as the report of a dozen time dimensionals appearing to a group of miners in Brevoy in the summer of 4284 ar. More confounding are events that appear to be an obvious call to time dimensionals, such as the appearance of the legendary Scepter of Ages, but that the dimensionals seem to ignore.

   A time dimensional can manipulate the flow of time as it affects nearby matter, with effects such as locking other creatures out of time's progression or aging an item so quickly it is effectively disintegrated. It has even greater control over its own temporal positioning, allowing it to move quickly around a battlefield and obtain comprehensive knowledge of where its enemies will strike. There are reports of exceptionally rare time dimensionals with greater abilities-such as the ability to erase a creature from time entirely-though the Dimension of Time dispatches such dimensionals only to deal with the most calamitous of situations.

   A time dimensional typically stands at 12 feet tall and weighs about 300 pounds.

##### Description

When an event or individual threatens the nature of causality or the flow of time, a portion of the Dimension of Time breaks away from the dimension’s substance to act as a correcting agent. These beings do not name themselves, but they are _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ time dimensionals by extraplanar scholars. Time dimensionals travel across the Great Beyond to confront and neutralize threats to the timestream. In some cases, this involves the removal of a _[[feats/Disruptive|disruptive]]_ individual or item, while in other cases it simply means delaying events long enough for the flow of time to correct itself. In the event of egregious disruptions, several time dimensionals may work together in perfect synchronicity to _[[spells/Preserve|preserve]]_ the timestream.

The very existence of time dimensionals can disrupt the flow of normal time, so the Dimension of Time dispatches a _time dimensional_ for only the exact duration required; furthermore, a _time dimensional_ uses only the minimum amount of force necessary to fulfill its duties. As the exact nature of time is fickle and never completely known, those who devote their lives to the study of time are unsure as to which events trigger a _time dimensional_’s appearance and which do not. Time dimensionals have appeared during seemingly mundane events, such as the report of a dozen time dimensionals appearing to a group of miners in Brevoy in the summer of 4284 ar. More _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Confounding|confounding]]_ are events that appear to be an obvious call to time dimensionals, such as the appearance of the legendary _[[items/Weapon/Scepter of Ages|Scepter of Ages]]_, but that the dimensionals seem to ignore.

A _time dimensional_ can manipulate the flow of time as it affects nearby matter, with effects such as locking other creatures out of time’s progression or aging an item so quickly it is effectively disintegrated. It has even greater control over its own temporal positioning, allowing it to move quickly around a battlefield and obtain comprehensive knowledge of where its enemies will strike. There are reports of exceptionally rare time dimensionals with greater abilities—such as the ability to _[[spells/Erase|erase]]_ a creature from time entirely—though the Dimension of Time dispatches such dimensionals only to deal with the most calamitous of situations.
