  Wall of Gears (Su): As a standard action, a clockwork golem can fold into a whirling
    wall of grinding gears measuring 10 feet by 10 feet or 5 feet by 20 feet. Anyone
    passing through the wall takes 15d6 points of slashing damage. If the wall appears
    in a creature's space, that creature can attempt a DC 18 Reflex save to leap to
    one side and avoid the damage entirely. The clockwork golem can take no actions
    while in this form except to resume its normal form as a move action. A clockwork
    golem's AC and immunities remain the same while it is in this form.
desc_long: Forged from thousands of gears, the clockwork golem is a precision creation.
  In combat, a clockwork golem is ruthlessly efficient, moving with swift conviction
  to grind and slice its foes to ribbons.
