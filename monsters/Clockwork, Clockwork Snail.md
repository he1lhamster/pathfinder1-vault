  Eidite Trail (Ex): A clockwork snail can release a noxious trail of poisonous ooze,
    coating any surface it treads upon with viscous liquid eidite. Any square that
    the clockwork snail moves through while this ability is active is covered in a
    nonmagical web effect that acts in all ways as the spell (DC 16 negates), but
    also has a chance of infecting whoever touches it with eidite sickness (see page
    19). A clockwork snail can activate or deactivate this ability as a swift action,
    and can cover a total of 40 squares per day, though these squares need not be
    consecutive. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Improved Charge (Ex): A clockwork snail excels at charging into enemies; it can
    move up to triple its speed when using the charge action, and ignores any effects
    of difficult terrain while charging.
  Tracks (Ex): A clockwork snail's tracks allow it to climb even sheer surfaces with
    ease, granting it a +16 racial bonus on Climb checks instead of the usual +8 for
    having a climb speed, and it can make attacks with its upper body normally even
    while climbing.
desc_long: Although their upper bodies resemble the clockwork soldiers from which
  their forms were no doubt inspired, these mechanical monstrosities are in fact a
  horrific blend of gastropod and clockwork, fusing the cruelest aspects of calculated
  war machinery and the foul influence of eidite. A clockwork snail is 12 feet tall
  and weighs 2,000 pounds.
