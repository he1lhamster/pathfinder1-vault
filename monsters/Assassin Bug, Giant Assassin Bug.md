    Poison Stream (Ex) As a standard action usable every 1d4 rounds, an assassin bug can spray poison from its mouthin a 15-foot line. Any creature caught in this area must succeed at a DC 14 Reflex save or be exposed to the assassin bug's poison. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
desc_long: |-
  An assassin bug partially buries itself in the sand or conceals itself among clusters of thorny bushes near oases, waiting for the next palatable creature to approach. When prey arrives, the insect bursts out of hiding and pierces its target with its elongated mouthparts, injecting a potent toxin. Once its prey is safely paralyzed, the assassin bug feeds by siphoning the victim's fluids. Even if these bites don't kill, they are extremely painful and cause swelling.

  Giant assassin bugs lay eggs in shallow caves or the crevices between rocks, preferably where food is readily available for the hatching young. An adult giant assassin bug is typically 4 feet long and weighs 65 pounds, though the larger varieties grow to a length of 6 feet and weigh around 150 pounds.

##### Description

An assassin bug partially buries itself in the sand or conceals itself among clusters of thorny bushes near oases, waiting for the next palatable creature to approach. When prey arrives, the insect bursts out of hiding and pierces its target with its elongated mouthparts, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Injecting|injecting]]_ a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ toxin. Once its prey is safely _[[conditions/Paralyzed|paralyzed]]_, the assassin bug feeds by siphoning the victim’s fluids. Even if these bites don’t kill, they are extremely painful and cause swelling.

Giant assassin bugs lay eggs in shallow caves or the crevices between rocks, preferably where food is readily available for the hatching young. An adult giant assassin bug is typically 4 feet long and weighs 65 pounds, though the larger varieties grow to a length of 6 feet and weigh around 150 pounds.
