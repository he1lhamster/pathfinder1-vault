    A creature with ticks clinging to it takes swarm damage at the end of its turn
    each round. As a full round action, the creature can remove the ticks with a DC
    20 Reflex save. At least 10 points of damage from any area effect destroys all
    clinging ticks. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  Disease (Ex): 'Bubonic Plague: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 21; onset 1 day; frequency
    1/day; effect 1d4 Con damage, 1 Cha damage, fatigue; cure 2 consecutive saves.
    The DC is Con-based.'
desc_long: Tick swarms are merciless blights, able to quickly reduce the larger animal
  life of a region they infest to blood-drained, diseased husks.
