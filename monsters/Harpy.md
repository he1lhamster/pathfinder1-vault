  Captivating Song (Su): A harpy's song has the power to infect the minds of those
    that hear it, calling them to the harpy's side. When a harpy sings, all creatures
    aside from other harpies within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 16 Will
    saving throw or become captivated. A creature that successfully saves is not subject
    to the same harpy's song for 24 hours. A victim under the effects of the captivating
    song moves toward the harpy using the most direct means available. If the path
    leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature
    receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Captivated
    creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within
    5 feet of the harpy simply stands and offers no resistance to the harpy's attacks.
    This effect continues for as long as the harpy sings and for 1 round thereafter.
    This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  Often viewed as vicious and corrupted creatures, harpies know how creatures think and act. This understanding gives them an advantage when it comes to finding their favorite meals. While creatures of the wild easily fall victim to their captivating songs, these vile bird-women prefer their meals spiced with complex sentient thoughts. Easy prey makes for a boring meal.

  While ultimately savage and without remorse for their actions, a number of harpies live close to humanoid societies and enjoy parlaying with creatures that they see as potential meals.

  Harpies tend to wear baubles and trinkets stolen from their victims, as they like to indulge in the shiny ornaments of mankind. Up close, these creatures reek with the stench of consumed victims, and they rarely let creatures not yet captivated too near, lest they smell the gore and decay upon their feathers. For this reason, many harpies wear perfumes and scented oils.

  Harpies appear wildly different in different lands. Some seem like an amalgam of vultures and women, while others bear the regal markings of hawks or falcons in their feathers. Rare clutches of harpies in isolated and tropical parts of the world even have colorful feathers akin to parrots.

##### Description

Often viewed as _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_ and corrupted creatures, harpies know how creatures think and act. This understanding gives them an advantage when it comes to finding their favorite meals. While creatures of the wild easily fall victim to their captivating songs, these vile bird-women prefer their meals spiced with complex sentient thoughts. Easy prey makes for a boring meal.

While ultimately savage and without remorse for their actions, a number of harpies live close to humanoid societies and enjoy parlaying with creatures that they see as potential meals.

Harpies tend to wear baubles and trinkets stolen from their victims, as they like to indulge in the shiny ornaments of mankind. Up close, these creatures reek with the _[[universal monster rules/Stench|stench]]_ of consumed victims, and they rarely let creatures not yet captivated too near, lest they smell the gore and decay upon their feathers. For this reason, many harpies wear perfumes and scented oils.

Harpies appear wildly different in different lands. Some seem like an amalgam of vultures and women, while others bear the regal markings of hawks or falcons in their feathers. Rare clutches of harpies in isolated and tropical parts of the world even have colorful feathers akin to parrots.
