  Bay (Su): When the Sandpoint devil screams, all creatures within a 300-foot-radius
    spread must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This
    is a sonic, mind-affecting, fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful,
    a creature is thereafter immune to the Sandpoint devil's bay for 24 hours. The
    save DC is Charisma-based.
  Hellfire Breath (Su): The Sandpoint devil can unleash blasts of infernal flame in
    a 30-ft cone, once every 1d4 rounds (damage 6d6 fire, Reflex 20 half). Any creature
    that fails the save also takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks,
    and skill checks. This effect lasts for a number of days equal to the damage taken,
    but is otherwise treated and can be removed as per the spell bestow curse. The
    save DC is Constitution-based.
  Trample (Ex): Reflex half DC 24. The save DC is Strength-based.

  A shadow in the Lost Coast's all-too common mists, it makes its presence known by baying terrible half-howls, half-screams that echo from the eerie stones of the Devil's Platter. The Sandpoint devil has haunted the lands around its namesake town for more than 10 years. Those who have seen the beast and borne witness to its horror describe it as a horse-like thing, with a nearly skeletal head filled with sharp, lupine teeth. From its lean, equine body jut a pair of ragged bat wings, its forelegs end in powerful hooves, capable of supporting it weirdly upright like a man. Details vary of its other features, but eyes that glow a demonic red; a tail like a reptile; and broken, stag-like antlers are also commonly reported.

  The Sandpoint devil most commonly appears on misty, moonless nights. A thief of livestock, kidnapper of children, and bringer of woes, countless tales surround the beast. Fully half the farmers in the Sandpoint region claim to have seen the creature on at least one occasion. Some stories say the devil is a manifestation of evil and that its coming foretells times of great woe-explaining its numerous sightings around the time of the Late Unpleasantness. Others explain away the creature as some ancient, wizard-warped beast that hides in the deepest crags of the Devil's Platter.

  Yet, for all the talk and to-do about the legend, little concrete proof ever lingers to widely confirm the creature's existence. Thus, many hold that the Sandpoint devil is but the drunken fantasy of local boozers and simple yokels. But even cynics are quick to change their minds when the mists rise on the lonely moors and only a few timber walls protect against the lurking, hungry things prowling the night.

Calloused, milky eyes glare balefully from a nearly skeletal head as a rasping hiss escapes a muzzle filled with _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ yellow _[[monsters/Wolf|wolf]]_ teeth.
