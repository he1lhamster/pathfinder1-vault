title1: Shark, Helicoprion
desc_short: This creature resembles an ordinary shark from tail to mouth, but the
  unusual shape of its lower jaw marks it as something else. A whorl of teeth spirals
  inward, tiny at the centre, but long and brutal farther out.

  Whorled Jaw (Ex): When a helicoprion hits a Medium or smaller creature with its
    bite it can, as a free action, attempt to grapple and then pin that creature should
    the initial grapple be successful. Once the target is pinned, the helicoprion
    continues to do its bite damage (including bleed) for as long as it maintains
    the pin.
desc_long: The helicoprion is a bizarre beast to behold. The remarkable physiology
  of its mouth allows it to f lick out its bottom jaw, unrolling the whorl of teeth
  and snaring prey along its length. As its powerful muscles roll its jaw, the prey
  becomes trapped in a spiral of ragged, brutal incisors. Once it has captured a hearty
  meal, the helicoprion retreats in a thickening cloud of its victim's blood to patiently
  await the slowing of struggles and the imminent demise of its dinner.

The helicoprion is a bizarre beast to behold. The remarkable physiology of its mouth allows it to f lick out its bottom jaw, unrolling the whorl of teeth and snaring prey along its length. As its powerful muscles roll its jaw, the prey becomes trapped in a spiral of ragged, brutal incisors. Once it has captured a hearty meal, the helicoprion retreats in a thickening cloud of its victim’s blood to patiently await the slowing of struggles and the imminent demise of its dinner.
