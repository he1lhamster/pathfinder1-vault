special_abilities:
  Change Shape (Su): A living sandstorm can shift between its humanoid form, shaped
    from packed sand, and a sandstorm form as a standard action. In sandstorm form,
    a living sandstorm functions as if it were a swarm of Fine creatures with a hive
    mind, and it loses its burrow speed, slam attacks, and compression abilities,
    but gains a fly speed and the ability to use its create sand and sand blast abilities.
    Its Strength score is reduced to 1, but its ability scores are otherwise unchanged.
    A living sandstorm remains in one form until it chooses to assume its other form.
    A change in form can't be dispelled, nor does the living sandstorm revert to any
    particular form when killed (both shapes are its true form). A true seeing spell
    reveals both forms simultaneously.
  Create Sand (Su): While in sandstorm form, a living sandstorm can, as a standard
    action, create 500 cubic feet of fine red sand, filling a 10-foot radius beneath
    it to a depth of 5 feet. All creatures in the area and adjacent squares must succeed
    at a DC 22 Reflex save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. Medium and smaller creatures
    in the area are buried and must begin holding their breath to avoid drowning in
    the sand. By attempting a Reflex save against the same DC, a creature can avoid
    being buried if there is an adjacent space outside the area to which it can move;
    if the save is successful, the creature is moved into an available adjacent space.
    As a standard action, each buried creature can dig itself out or be dug out by
    another with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Invisible creatures in or adjacent
    to the area when the sand is created are outlined until the dust is removed. The
    save DC is Constitution-based.
  Sand Blast (Ex): When in sandstorm form, a living sandstorm can attack with a blast
    of scouring sand in a 20-foot line. The sand deals 6d6 points of slashing damage
    and blinds creatures in the area for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 22 Reflex save
    halves the damage and negates the blinding. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Sandsight (Ex): The living sandstorm can see through sand, dust, and other particles
    in the air as if the air were clear, ignoring the miss chance for these obstructions,
    up to its normal range of vision.
  Slashing Sand (Ex): |-
    A living sandstorm's swarm attack deals slashing damage. Its slam attacks deal bludgeoning and slashing damage.

    Notorious for appearing suddenly out of the roiling tempests of the deep desert, living sandstorms are capable of turning oases and dry farmlands into areas of featureless desert in a shockingly short span of time. When angered, they can scour a whole army down to bits of shining metal and bone buried under feet of shifting sand over the course of one terrible night. Some Osiriani scholars claim that living sandstorms are related to the deadly khamsin storms that scour the desert, and while these creatures are related to elementals, they have nothing to do with the formation of those iconic storms. Living sandstorms are most comfortable when sand is free to flow across the earth. They become agitated whenever creatures make an effort to remove or limit sand in an area, shelter an area from the drifting dust, or alter the weather to reduce or prevent sandstorms. However, they are curious creatures and enjoy experiencing new interactions with beings of other shapes, and are willing to parley when they believe doing so may open the door to a novel diversion-or if a creature simply appears easy to intimidate.

    A living sandstorm in its humanoid shape is about 6 feet tall and weighs 900 pounds. In sandstorm form, it expands its form into a pulsing cloud of streaming, loose sand, which gathers into small clumps before being reabsorbed into the storm.

### Special Abilities

**_Change Shape_ (Su) **A living sandstorm can shift between its humanoid form, shaped from packed sand, and a sandstorm form as a standard action. In sandstorm form, a living sandstorm functions as if it were a swarm of Fine creatures with a hive mind, and it loses its _[[universal monster rules/Burrow|burrow]]_ speed, slam attacks, and _[[universal monster rules/Compression|compression]]_ abilities, but gains a fly speed and the ability to use its create sand and sand blast abilities. Its Strength score is reduced to 1, but its ability scores are otherwise unchanged. A living sandstorm remains in one form until it chooses to assume its other form. A change in form can’t be dispelled, nor does the living sandstorm revert to any particular form when killed (both shapes are its _[[spells/True Form|true form]]_). A _[[spells/True Seeing|true seeing]]_ spell reveals both forms simultaneously.

**Create Sand (Su)** While in sandstorm form, a living sandstorm can, as a standard action, create 500 cubic feet of fine red sand, filling a 10-foot radius beneath it to a depth of 5 feet. All creatures in the area and adjacent squares must succeed at a DC 22 Reflex save or be _[[conditions/Blinded|blinded]]_ for 1d4 rounds. _[[classes/Medium|Medium]]_ and smaller creatures in the area are buried and must begin holding their breath to avoid drowning in the sand. By attempting a Reflex save against the same DC, a creature can avoid being buried if there is an adjacent space outside the area to which it can move; if the save is successful, the creature is moved into an available adjacent space. As a standard action, each buried creature can dig itself out or be dug out by another with a successful DC 15 Strength check. _[[conditions/Invisible|Invisible]]_ creatures in or adjacent to the area when the sand is created are outlined until the dust is removed. The save DC is Constitution-based.
**Sand Blast (Ex)** When in sandstorm form, a living sandstorm can attack with a blast of scouring sand in a 20-foot line. The sand deals 6d6 points of slashing damage and blinds creatures in the area for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Blinding|blinding]]_. The save DC is Constitution-based.
**Sandsight (Ex)** The living sandstorm can see through sand, dust, and other particles in the air as if the air were clear, ignoring the miss chance for these obstructions, up to its normal range of _[[spells/Vision|vision]]_.
**Slashing Sand (Ex)** A living sandstorm’s swarm attack deals slashing damage. Its slam attacks deal bludgeoning and slashing damage.

Notorious for appearing suddenly out of the roiling tempests of the deep desert, living sandstorms are capable of turning oases and dry farmlands into areas of featureless desert in a shockingly short span of time. When angered, they can scour a whole army down to bits of shining metal and bone buried under feet of _[[spells/Shifting Sand|shifting sand]]_ over the course of one terrible night. Some Osiriani scholars claim that living sandstorms are related to the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ khamsin storms that scour the desert, and while these creatures are related to elementals, they have nothing to do with the formation of those iconic storms. Living sandstorms are most comfortable when sand is free to flow across the earth. They become agitated whenever creatures make an effort to remove or limit sand in an area, shelter an area from the drifting dust, or alter the weather to reduce or prevent sandstorms. However, they are curious creatures and enjoy experiencing new interactions with beings of other shapes, and are willing to parley when they believe doing so may open the door to a novel diversion—or if a creature simply appears easy to intimidate.

A living sandstorm in its humanoid shape is about 6 feet tall and weighs 900 pounds. In sandstorm form, it expands its form into a pulsing cloud of streaming, loose sand, which gathers into small clumps before being reabsorbed into the storm.
