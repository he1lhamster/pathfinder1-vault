special_abilities:
  Drowning Touch (Su): A fossegrim can flood the lungs of a creature that is willing,
    is helpless, is affected by its enchanted music ability, touches it while it's
    in treasure form, or is touched by it (traditionally by kissing the creature on
    the lips). If the target cannot breathe water, it cannot hold its breath and immediately
    begins to drown slowly. On its turn, the target can attempt a DC 16 Fortitude
    save to cough up this water; if it fails, it falls unconscious at 0 hp. On the
    next round, a fallen target must attempt another DC 16 Fortitude save, dropping
    to -1 hit points and dying if it fails; on the next round it must attempt to save
    again or lose 1d6 hit points. On the first successful save, the water clears from
    the target's lungs and the target stabilizes. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Enchanting Music (Su): As a full-round action, a fossegrim can play a musical stringed
    instrument (usually a harp or violin) and target a single creature within 45 feet
    that can hear and see the fossegrim with an effect identical to the unnatural
    lustUM spell (CL 9th; Will DC 19). This action provokes an attack of opportunity.
    If the target touches or kisses the fossegrim, the fey can affect the target with
    its drowning touch ability. This is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion effect.
    The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Transparency (Su): When underwater, a fossegrim's body becomes transparent, effectively
    rendering it invisible. It can become visible or transparent at will as a free
    action.
  Treasure Form (Su): As a standard action when completely underwater, a fossegrim
    can create an illusion causing it to resemble a Medium pile of gold and silver
    coins, glittering jewels, and valuable art objects. If a fossegrim speaks, moves,
    attacks, or uses any of its special abilities or spell-like abilities while in
    treasure form, the illusion dissipates. A successful DC 19 Will save is required
    to disbelieve this illusion. If a living creature within the fossegrim's melee
    reach touches or physically interacts with the illusion, the fossegrim reaches
    out to kiss or otherwise touch that creature, automatically affecting the creature
    with its drowning touch ability. The fossegrim can maintain this illusion indefinitely
    and can revert to its normal natural form as a free action. This is a mindaffecting
    illusion (glamer) effect. The save DC to disbelieve is Charisma-based.
desc_long: Pale and possessing unnatural beauty, fossegrims are wicked fey who haunt
  idyllic waterfalls, where they lure the unsuspecting near with song and the promise
  of treasure, only to drown them. Well built and elf like in appearance, fossegrims
  are gifted musicians, and their lairs often echo with the sound of bewitching music.
  They are never without their enchanting instruments.
