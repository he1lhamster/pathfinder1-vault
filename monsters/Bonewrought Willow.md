  Arising from the bones sloughed from mortal bodies by souls moving on to their final planar destinations, bonewrought willows grow in lonely places in the Boneyard.

Stray soul fragments remain in a bonewrought willow, giving it a dim intelligence and a keen awareness of living and undead creatures in its vicinity. Bonewrought willows serve as protectors of the dead. They often distrust the living and shake their rattling branches to scare such creatures away. When pressed into combat, a bonewrought willow usually starts by disgorging a spray of partially digested bone fragments at its enemies and then follows up with slam attacks.

   A bonewrought willow stands between 12 and 15 feet tall and weighs about 800 pounds.

##### Description

Despite their undead appearance, these trees are actually alive, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Growing|growing]]_ in the shape of _weeping_ willows to symbolize the loss associated with the deaths that created them. Stray soul fragments remain in a _bonewrought willow_, giving it a dim intelligence and a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Keen|keen]]_ awareness of living and undead creatures in its vicinity. Bonewrought willows serve as protectors of the dead. They often distrust the living and shake their rattling branches to _[[spells/Scare|scare]]_ such creatures away. When pressed into combat, a _bonewrought willow_ usually starts by disgorging a spray of partially digested bone fragments at its enemies and then follows up with slam attacks.

A _bonewrought willow_ stands between 12 and 15 feet tall and weighs about 800 pounds.
