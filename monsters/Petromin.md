    be detected by other means.

    degrees while flying. It must end its turn on the ground.
  Luminous (Ex): A petromin naturally sheds light equal to that provided by a candle.
    It can control the color of the illumination. As a swift action, it can extinguish
    the light.
desc_long: Petromins, also known as azure gliders, are desert cliff-top dwellers that
  glide down to snatch prey. As a defense, their coloration is countershaded; the
  blue, sky-like coloration on their undersides makes them hard to notice from the
  ground, while their brown fur helps them blend into desert vistas below, hiding
  them from predatory birds. The fur of petromins is awash in sapphire-blue bioluminescence,
  unnoticeable during the day but distinctive from dusk until dawn. Petromins have
  control over this natural light, which allows them to attract the large insects
  on which they feed. A petromin measures 30 inches in length (including a 6-inchlong
  tail) and weighs 5 pounds. A spellcaster can select a petromin as a familiar, and
  the master gains a +3 bonus on Stealth checks as a special ability.

##### Description

Petromins, also known as azure gliders, are desert cliff-top dwellers that _[[spells/Glide|glide]]_ down to _[[feats/Snatch|snatch]]_ prey. As a defense, their coloration is countershaded; the blue, sky-like coloration on their undersides makes them hard to notice from the ground, while their brown fur helps them _[[spells/Blend|blend]]_ into desert vistas below, hiding them from predatory birds. The fur of petromins is awash in sapphire-blue bioluminescence, unnoticeable during the day but distinctive from dusk until dawn. Petromins have control over this natural light, which allows them to attract the large insects on which they feed. A _petromin_ measures 30 inches in length (including a 6-inchlong tail) and weighs 5 pounds. A spellcaster can select a _petromin_ as a familiar, and the master gains a +3 bonus on Stealth checks as a special ability.
