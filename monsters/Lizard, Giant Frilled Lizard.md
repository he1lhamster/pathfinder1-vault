  Intimidating Charge (Ex): When a giant frilled lizard charges, it hisses ferociously,

    the creature charged must make a DC 13 Will save or be shaken for 1d6 rounds.
    This is a fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

  Many species of giant lizard exist-other species lack this lizard's intimidating
  charge special ability but might have other special attacks like grab, trip, constrict
