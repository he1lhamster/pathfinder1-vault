  A divine guardian is a creature chosen by the gods to guard a sacred site of the faith. Blessed with eternal life (or damned, some might say), a divine guardian spends untold centuries in the service of its deity, tirelessly and deathlessly defending its charge from any who would seek to desecrate it.

  Typically such a creature is transformed into a form more regal than its mortal one, setting it apart from a typical member of its race or species. A divine guardian is spiritually connected to the one site that it must guard for eternity. As long as a divine guardian remains within that site, it does not hunger, thirst, get sick, or even age. Within the bounds of its sacred site, a divine guardian possesses numerous defensive powers to ward it from intruders, but it can never leave the area or the long years of its service will finally catch up to it. A divine guardian must weigh the power and prestige of its endless responsibility against the freedom death might inevitably bring.

  Most divine guardians are chosen servants who agree to willingly serve their gods for all eternity, but some have been cursed with their duty in response for some harm to the god's faithful or as atonement for some great sin. Whatever the nature of its creation, a divine guardian is still beholden to the god that granted it its powers, and to the followers of that god as well.

  A cleric or paladin of the deity that created a divine guardian can issue the guardian commands. This does not give the cleric or paladin complete control over the creature, but the guardian does respond favorably to those requests. For example, a cleric could ask it to not attack her companions, or to help her defend the guardian's sacred site from attackers. A cleric or paladin of the same faith must win an opposed Charisma check to convince a divine guardian to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. A divine guardian can never be ordered to leave its sacred site or to go against the tenets of its deity's faith.

  The divine guardian hydra presented here is built using a hydra from the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary. See page 178 of the Bestiary for rules on this creature's hydra traits and regenerate head abilities. This divine guardian hydra is a divine guardian of the god of nature and the weather, thus giving it the air and water subtypes.

##### Description

A divine _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Guardian|guardian]]_ is a creature chosen by the gods to _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_ a _sacred_ site of the faith. _Blessed_ with eternal life (or _[[feats/Damned|damned]]_, some might say), a divine _guardian_ spends untold centuries in the service of its deity, tirelessly and deathlessly _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Defending|defending]]_ its charge from any who would seek to _[[spells/Desecrate|desecrate]]_ it.

Typically such a creature is transformed into a form more regal than its mortal one, setting it apart from a typical member of its race or species. A divine _guardian_ is spiritually connected to the one site that it must _guard_ for eternity. As long as a divine _guardian_ remains within that site, it does not hunger, thirst, get sick, or even age. Within the bounds of its _sacred_ site, a divine _guardian_ possesses numerous defensive powers to ward it from intruders, but it can never leave the area or the long years of its service will finally catch up to it. A divine _guardian_ must weigh the power and prestige of its endless responsibility against the _[[spells/Freedom|freedom]]_ death might inevitably bring.

Most divine guardians are chosen servants who agree to willingly serve their gods for all eternity, but some have been cursed with their duty in response for some _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ to the god’s faithful or as _[[spells/Atonement|atonement]]_ for some great sin. Whatever the nature of its creation, a divine _guardian_ is still beholden to the god that granted it its powers, and to the followers of that god as well.

A _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ or _[[classes/Paladin|paladin]]_ of the deity that created a divine _guardian_ can issue the _guardian_ commands. This does not give the _cleric_ or _paladin_ complete control over the creature, but the _guardian_ does respond favorably to those requests. For example, a _cleric_ could ask it to not attack her companions, or to help her defend the _guardian_’s _sacred_ site from attackers. A _cleric_ or _paladin_ of the same faith must win an opposed Charisma check to convince a divine _guardian_ to do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do. A divine _guardian_ can never be ordered to leave its _sacred_ site or to go against the tenets of its deity’s faith.

The divine _guardian_ _hydra_ presented here is built using a _hydra_ from the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary. See page 178 of the Bestiary for rules on this creature’s _hydra_ traits and _regenerate_ head abilities. This divine _guardian_ _hydra_ is a divine _guardian_ of the god of nature and the weather, thus giving it the air and water subtypes.
