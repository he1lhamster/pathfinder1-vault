special_abilities:
  Ablative Adaptation (Su): As a standard action, the Grand Defender can cast off
    its outer layer of metal, revealing a slightly smaller version of itself underneath.
    This new form may be made of cold iron, mithral, or iron, and its appearance may
    change with each use of the ability, altering its apparent genders, hair style,
    and so on. In its cold iron form, the Grand Defender's DR changes to DR 15/cold
    iron and its attacks count as cold iron for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction.
    In its mithral form, its DR changes to DR 15/silver and its attacks count as silver.
    In its iron form, its abilities revert to normal. If the herald is brought to
    0 hit points, it becomes inert; 1d4 hours after it last took damage, it sheds
    its outer layer and reanimates at half its normal hit points. Regardless of how
    often it uses this ability, the herald never changes size categories, as if it
    slowly grows to its normal size between transformations. Once shed, the outer
    layer decays into worthless powder 1d4 minutes after the transformation, though
    before this occurs it can spend 1 full round consuming the discarded metal to
    recharge its hammer storm ability.
  Breath Weapon (Su): As a free action once every 1d4+1 rounds, an iron golem can
    exhale a 10-foot cube of poisonous gas that persists for 1 round. Any creature
    within the area when it is exhaled (as well as any creature that passes through
    the cloud during the remainder of that round) is exposed to the cloud's poisonous
    effects. This poison is magically created each time the golem uses this power.
    Breath weapon-inhaled; save Fort DC 19; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect
    1d4 Constitution damage; cure 2 saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Defender's Shield (Ex): The Grand Defender's shield is a +3 heavy steel shield,
    though it becomes nonmagical if the herald is destroyed or is no longer holding
    or wearing it.
  Dwarf Traits (Ex): 'The Grand Defender has the following dwarven racial traits:
    defensive training, hardy, hatred, stability, stonecunning, and weapon familiarity.'
  Hammer Storm (Ex): Once per day as a full-round action, the Grand Defender can expel
    a volley of warhammers from its mouth in a 30-foot cone that deals 15d6 points
    of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 19 half). If the herald is in its cold iron or
    mithral form, these hammers count as cold iron or silver. The Grand Defender can
    exclude any number of squares in the cone's area, preventing the hammers from
    striking those squares. The attack also counts as an awesome blow, though the
    Defender makes a single combat maneuver check, applying that result to the CMD
    of all creatures in the area, and affected creatures can only be knocked directly
    away from the Defender. The hammer storm actually creates 24 physical warhammers
    that persist after the instantaneous attack and may be used by creatures (though
    they are normal warhammers, not masterwork, cold iron, or mithral). The Grand
    Defender can spend 1 minute eating 24 warhammers (or an equivalent amount of metal)
    to recharge this ability.
  Immunity to Magic (Ex): The Grand Defender is immune to spells or spell-like abilities
    that allow spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against
    it, as noted below. A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows the Grand
    Defender (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.A magical attack
    that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the Grand Defender and heals
    1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal.
    If the amount of healing would cause the herald to exceed its full normal hit
    points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. The Defender gets no saving
    throw against fire effects.The Grand Defender is affected normally by rust attacks,
    such as those of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.
desc_long: Created by Torag to serve as his herald, the Grand Defender is a powerful
  golem animated by the collective will of dozens of great dwarf heroes. The heroic
  souls within the golem consider it an honor to lend their knowledge and love of
  battle to this mighty shell so it can protect dwarves in the mortal world. These
  heroes control the golem for anything from a single manifestation to several consecutive
  months of tasks, and afterward return to their reward in the afterlife. These multiple
  identities contribute to its varying appearance in each incarnation, even changing
  its apparent gender. The above statistics describe a typical manifestation of the
  herald, though if it is summoned for a specific purpose, the individual spirits
  within might have greater knowledge pertaining to that purpose. In general, the
  herald is friendly toward followers of Torag and focused on defending individuals
  or communities.
