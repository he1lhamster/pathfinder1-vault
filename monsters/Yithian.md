special_abilities:
  Amnesia (Su): Once per day as a standard action, a yithian can attempt to inflict
    amnesia on a target it is able to communicate telepathically with. A target can
    resist this attack with a DC 21 Will save. If the target fails its save, it takes
    a permanent -4 penalty on Will saving throws and all skill checks, and loses all
    memories save for those the yithian chooses to leave intact. This effect can be
    cured by heal or greater restoration. This is a mind-affecting insanity effect.
    The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Deadly Pincers (Ex): A yithian always applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier
    to damage dealt by its pincer attacks, and deals triple damage on a critical hit.
    Pincers are primary attacks for yithians.
  Mind Swap (Su): As a full-round action, a yithian can trade minds with another living
    creature it is able to communicate telepathically with. This functions as magic
    jar, except the two minds trade bodies. An unwilling target can resist the mind
    swap with a DC 21 Will save, after which that particular yithian cannot attempt
    to swap minds with that creature again for 24 hours. The yithian can end the effect
    of this mind swap at any time and over any distance as a full-round action, instantly
    returning both minds to the proper bodies-if the yithian wishes, it may attempt
    to use its amnesia power on the other mind as a free action when it ends the mind
    swap in this way. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Scholar (Ex): Yithians treat all knowledge skills as class skills.
desc_long: |-
  Untold eons ago, the yithians inhabited a dying world. To escape their doomed planet, they cast their minds through time and space, eventually coming to rest in the strange, alien bodies they possess today. While these strange beings now reside in a distant galaxy, the yithians make use of their ability to astrally project to explore other planets, eager to find new worlds to explore.

  When a yithian arrives upon a new world, it often swaps minds with the creatures it encounters there so as to experience that world as if it were a native. Those who spend time in a yithian's body rarely tell of the strange times they have experienced, for yithians guard themselves well, and leave those they use in this manner amnesiacs who remember the truth only as fragmentary nightmares.

##### Description

Untold eons ago, the yithians inhabited a _[[conditions/Dying|dying]]_ world. To escape their doomed planet, they cast their minds through time and space, eventually coming to rest in the strange, alien bodies they possess today. While these strange beings now reside in a distant galaxy, the yithians make use of their ability to astrally project to explore other planets, eager to find new worlds to explore.

When a _yithian_ arrives upon a new world, it often swaps minds with the creatures it encounters there so as to experience that world as if it were a native. Those who spend time in a _yithian_’s body rarely tell of the strange times they have experienced, for yithians _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_ themselves well, and leave those they use in this manner amnesiacs who remember the truth only as fragmentary nightmares.
