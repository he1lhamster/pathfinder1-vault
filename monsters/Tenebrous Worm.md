  Acid (Su): The acid of a tenebrous worm's bite affects only organic matter-as it
    dissolves creatures, it converts their flesh to shadow that swiftly fades away,
    leaving raw, jagged wounds behind. In dim light, acid damage dealt by a tenebrous
    worm's bite increases to 8d6 points of damage, while in darkness or bright light,
    the acid damage is reduced to 4d6.
  Bristles (Su): Long bristles of shadowstuff extend from between the tenebrous worm's
    armor plates. These bristles react swiftly to attacks, stabbing at any creature
    that attempts to harm the worm. Each time a creature attacks a tenebrous worm,
    it must make a DC 18 Reflex save to avoid being punctured by several bristles.
    Each time a creature is punctured by these bristles, it takes 1d4 points of piercing
    damage and is exposed to the tenebrous worm's poison. A creature that grapples
    a tenebrous worm is automatically hurt by these bristles. The save DC to avoid
    the bristles is Dexterity-based.
  Poison (Su): Bristles-injury; save Fort DC 20, frequency 1/round for 6 rounds, effect
    paralysis for 1d4 rounds plus 1d2 Con (the duration of the paralysis is cumulative
    with each failed save), cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

  The caterpillar-like tenebrous worm is a voracious predator that hungers for mortal flesh. The tenebrous worm is the larval stage of the gloomwing (see page 133)-but in a strange reversal, these younger creatures are more dangerous than the adults they grow into. A native of the Plane of Shadow, a tenebrous worm hatches from the body of an unfortunate creature that has been implanted with an egg by a gloomwing. The tenebrous worm is fully grown upon hatching, and immediately begins to scour its environs for flesh to consume.

  Although the tenebrous worm tends to be relatively pale-colored, its internal organs seethe and roil with shadowy energies and dark fluids. As the creature feeds, these shadowy innards begin to grow out of its body, forming strange bristle-like filaments of semisolid shadowstuff not only capable of piercing the flesh of those who would attack the worm, but also possessing a deadly paralytic poison. Additional shadowy fluids constantly seep from the worm's mandibles-when it bites prey, these fluids melt flesh into shadows that the creature can then consume. When a tenebrous worm feeds on enough of this shadowy flesh, the creature seeks out a secluded, shady area (typically just within a cave entrance or in a ruined building) and spins a shadowy cocoon around itself. A tenebrous worm's cocoon exudes the effects of a darkness spell (CL 8th), muting the surrounding light. After a period of several days, the cocoon tears open and a fully grown gloomwing emerges, ready to seek a host for its eggs.

These bristles react swiftly to attacks, stabbing at any creature that attempts to _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ the worm.

Each time a creature is punctured by these bristles, it takes 1d4 points of piercing damage and is exposed to the _tenebrous worm_’s poison. A creature that grapples a _tenebrous worm_ is automatically hurt by these bristles. The save DC to avoid the bristles is Dexterity-based.

##### Description

The caterpillar-like _tenebrous worm_ is a voracious predator that hungers for mortal flesh. The _tenebrous worm_ is the larval stage of the _[[monsters/Gloomwing|gloomwing]]_ (see page 133)—but in a strange reversal, these younger creatures are more dangerous than the adults they grow into. A native of the Plane of _Shadow_, a _tenebrous worm_ hatches from the body of an unfortunate creature that has been implanted with an egg by a _gloomwing_. The _tenebrous worm_ is fully grown upon hatching, and immediately begins to scour its environs for flesh to consume.

Although the _tenebrous worm_ tends to be relatively pale-colored, its internal organs seethe and roil with shadowy energies and dark fluids. As the creature feeds, these shadowy innards begin to grow out of its body, forming strange bristle-like filaments of semisolid shadowstuff not only capable of piercing the flesh of those who would attack the worm, but also possessing a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ paralytic poison. Additional shadowy fluids constantly seep from the worm’s mandibles—when it bites prey, these fluids melt flesh into shadows that the creature can then consume. When a _tenebrous worm_ feeds on enough of this shadowy flesh, the creature seeks out a secluded, shady area (typically just within a cave entrance or in a ruined building) and spins a shadowy cocoon around itself. A _tenebrous worm_’s cocoon exudes the effects of a _darkness_ spell (CL 8th), muting the surrounding light. After a period of several days, the cocoon tears open and a fully grown _gloomwing_ emerges, ready to seek a host for its eggs.
