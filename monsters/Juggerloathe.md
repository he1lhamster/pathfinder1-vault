  Devour Life (Su): The Juggerloathe's stomach leeches the life force of those trapped
    within it, rather than digesting them with acids. Any living victims that are
    swallowed whole and killed while within the Juggerloathe are turned into twisted
    creatures of undeath and pain. Regardless of their original size or form, those
    killed within the Juggerloathe become bodaks (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 48), though
    their appearance may be less humanoid than those of typical bodaks. These undead
    stop taking damage while within the Juggerloathe, and escape its innards when
    it next uses its ejection attack. The undead aren't controlled by the Juggerloathe,
    but they don't attack it and it is immune to their powers.
  Ejection (Ex): The Juggerloathe can eject the contents of its stomach in a 60-foot
    cone that deals 8d6 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 27 half) once every 1d6 rounds.
    Any creatures swallowed whole by it-still living and undead-land prone at the
    far end of the cone. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Leaping Shockwave (Ex): The Juggerloathe leaps into combat much like normal bulettes,
    but lands with an earth-shaking impact. When it charges, it can attempt a DC 25
    Acrobatics check to jump into the air and land next to its enemies. If it's successful,
    all adjacent foes must succeed at a DC 30 Reflex save or be knocked prone. The
    Juggerloathe ends its charge with two bite attacks and two claw attacks, dividing
    them up as it sees fit among targets within reach. The save DC is Strength-based.
desc_long: 'The seemingly unstoppable spawn of a bulette of massive size and Yethazmari
  (Lamashtu's herald; see page 99 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods),
  the Juggerloathe is 50 feet from its nose to the base of its tail, and weighs slightly
  more than 100 tons. It has been a living legend among the tribes of Belkzen for
  centuries. Although it's seemingly content to remain hidden in its lair within the
  Mindspin Mountains, the creature is sometimes driven out onto the plains by hunger.
  Entire tribes have been known to disappear into its gullet, and it leaves only desolation
  and fiendishly warped undead in the wake of its rampages.'
