  Incorporeal Step (Su): When an unfettered phantom moves more than 5 feet, it becomes
    incorporeal until it stops moving.
  Phantasmagoric Slam (Su): |-
    An unfettered phantom's attacks are considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Its slams have an additional effect based on its emotional focus. Each phantom has one of the following emotional foci. This phantom's emotional focus is anger, and is already reflected in the statistics above. The DCs for the slam's effects are Charisma-based.
    Anger: An anger unfettered phantom's slam attack deals damage equal to 1d8 + its Strength modifier instead of the normal amount of damage (1d6 + its Strength modifier).
    Dedication: When a dedication unfettered phantom hits a creature with its slam attack, it gains a +2 bonus to its AC against that creature for 1 round. If the unfettered phantom hits the same creature multiple times, this bonus stacks.
    Despair: A creature hit by a despair unfettered phantom's slam attack must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 13) or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls and damage rolls for 1 round.
    Fear: A creature hit by a fear unfettered phantom's slam attack must succeed at a DC 13 Will saving throw or become shaken for 1d4 rounds.
    Hatred: A hatred unfettered phantom gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with its slam attack against the creature that most recently harmed it.
    Jealousy: A jealousy unfettered phantom gains sneak attack +1d6 when using its slam attack.
    Zeal: A zeal unfettered phantom's slam attack has a critical threat range of 19-20 and a critical multiplier of ×3.
desc_long: Willful fugitives of the Negative Energy Plane's dread gravity, phantoms
  are escaped souls of humanoid creatures in desperate search of a psychically attuned
  being with whom to merge-such a merger creates a spiritualist. Every phantom harbors
  a strong emotion that tears it from the normal path of souls seeking final judgment
  and reward. This dominant emotion empowers the phantom's slam attack and can manifest
  in more potent forms when this creature merges with a spiritualist, but it also
  serves as a weight that drags the phantom into the Ethereal Plane and toward the
  Negative Energy Plane. Until an unfettered phantom finds a refuge, it is a frantic
  and shifting thing, a desperate creature of raw emotion and need.
