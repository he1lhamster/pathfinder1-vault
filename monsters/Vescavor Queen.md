### Special Abilities

**Chaos Aura (Su)** A _[[monsters/Vescavor Queen|vescavor queen]]_ is an embodiment of chaos.

Its aura is a font of _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Anarchic|anarchic]]_ energy that grants _fast healing_

2 to the _vescavor queen_, as well as to any _[[monsters/Vescavor Swarm|vescavor swarm]]_

within 10 feet of the queen. A _vescavor queen_ can activate

or suppress this ability as a free action.

**Gibber (Su)** Like their broods, vescavor queens yammer the

endless chorus of the Abyss. Any creature within 15 feet of

a _vescavor queen_ must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be

_[[conditions/Confused|confused]]_ for 1 round. A creature that successfully saves can’t

be affected by the same _vescavor queen_’s gibbering for 24

hours. This is a mind-affecting sonic compulsion. The save DC

is Constitution-based.
**Spit Acid (Ex)** As a standard action, a _vescavor queen_ can

make a ranged touch attack to spit acid at a foe within

30 feet. A target hit by this glob of acid takes 5d6 points

of acid damage. In addition, the spit of a _vescavor queen_

contains some of its pheromones. Any target that takes

damage from this attack acts as a beacon for vescavor

swarms; the damaged creature takes a –8 penalty on

Stealth checks against the _vescavor queen_ and swarms it

controls, and likely becomes the swarm’s next target.
**Swarm Mother (Su)** A _vescavor queen_ can mentally

control up to 20 Hit Dice of vescavor swarms through

a combination of pheromones and supernatural

manipulation. To control a _vescavor swarm_, the vescavor

queen must be able to see it and must be within 120 feet

of it. Attempting to control a _vescavor swarm_ is a standard

action, and the swarm can attempt to resist this attempt

with a DC 17 Will save. If the swarm fails this save, the

_vescavor queen_ can issue a simple mental _[[spells/Command|command]]_ as a

swift action, such as ”fight,” ”come here,” ”go there,” or

”stay still.” Vescavor swarms affected by this ability act

normally unless a _vescavor queen_ is actively controlling

them, but never attack the _vescavor queen_. The save DC

is Charisma-based. In addition, whether or not it controls

the swarm, a _vescavor queen_ is immune to a vescavor

swarm’s swarm attacks and supernatural special abilities.

A _vescavor queen_ can release a _vescavor swarm_ from its

control as a free action. If a _vescavor queen_ is killed, any

vescavor swarms under its control disperse.

##### Description

Appearing as an amalgam of twisted, unnatural insects,

a _vescavor queen_ is a hideous sight to behold, even among

the terrifying denizens of the Abyss. Not only is a queen’s

bite stronger than that of its spawn, but the queen can

also spit acid at opponents, and its arms end in scything

claws poised to _[[universal monster rules/Rend|rend]]_ through f lesh and armor. Vescavor

swarms instinctively obey a queen, eagerly seeking out

those foes marked by the queen’s attacks. A vescavor

queen measures roughly 10 feet from head to tail, and

weighs nearly 500 pounds— more when carrying a brood.
