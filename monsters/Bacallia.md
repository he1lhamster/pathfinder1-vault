  Dazzling (Ex): While uninjured and in normal or bright light, a bacallia's wool
    reflects light in distracting ways. All non-bacallias within 10 feet take a -1
    penalty on saving throws against effects that would dazzle or fascinate them.
  Pristine Wool (Ex): Most impurities bead and slide off a bacallia's dense wool,
    leaving it gleamingly clean. This grants the bacallia a +2 racial bonus on saving
    throws against contact poisons and effects that would entangle it. It also gains
    a +1 bonus to its touch AC.
  Spit (Ex): Once per hour, a bacallia can spit its foul stomach contents at a single
    target within 10 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or be
    sickened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
  Bacallias are alpine camelids with luxuriously soft wool, expressive eyes, and short tempers. First domesticated by the dwarves of Tar Taargadth, bacallias became critical herd animals in supplying meat, milk, and wool to both the dwarves and their Kellid neighbors. The creatures are adequate pack animals, capable of bearing modest loads or light riders. Selective breeding has refined the texture and luster of bacallias' already-thick coats, which naturally repel rainwater and refract sunlight in scintillating patterns.

   A typical bacallia weighs about 150 pounds and has a market price of 25 gp. Bacallias with exceptionally soft wool, famous pedigrees, or both can sell for 500 gp or more, and the status of owning such an animal sometimes drives the price dramatically higher.
