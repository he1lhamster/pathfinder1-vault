### Special Abilities

**Leaching _Gaze_ (Su)** When opened, a hegessik’s _[[items/Wondrous Item/Third Eye|third eye]]_ produces a powerful _gaze_ attack with a 30-foot range. A creature affected by this attack takes 1d3 points of Wisdom damage unless it succeeds at a DC 24 Will save. Proteans are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Maddening Whispers (Su)** A mind-bending susurrus of voices and false perceptions infuses reality in close proximity to a hegessik protean. Any creature within the range of the protean’s aura must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or be _[[conditions/Confused|confused]]_ for 1 round. A creature with a chaotic component to its alignment gains a +4 bonus on this save, and creatures with the chaotic subtype are immune. This is a mind-affecting effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.

**Telekinetic Reach (Su)** Every 1d4 rounds, a hegessik protean can take a full-round action to make all of its _[[universal monster rules/Natural Attacks|natural attacks]]_ as a flurry of telekinetic force with a range of 60 feet. Such attack rolls take a –5 penalty when made at a distance of up to 30 feet, and a –10 penalty when made at a distance of 31–60 feet. A hegessik protean must have line of effect to a target in order to use this ability. A hegessik can’t use its _grab_ or warpwave ability with attacks made using this ability.

##### Description

The reclusive hegessiks are the wandering clergy of the protean race, itinerant spiritual elders and voices in the supernatural wilderness. Detached from the ever-shifting pseudo-structure of powerful protean cabals, hegessiks serve as intermediaries between them and as agents of the protean lords. Along with keketar proteans (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 215), they deal with those gods who dwell within the Maelstrom.

The average hegessik is 14 feet long and weighs 1,400 pounds.
