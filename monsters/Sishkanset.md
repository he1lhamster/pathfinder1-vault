special_abilities:
  Chilling Touch (Su): A sishkanset can make a melee touch attack that deals 6d8 points
    of cold damage.
  Disorienting Gale (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds, a sishkanset can create a 60-foot
    line of freezing, madness-laced winds. Creatures caught in the gale take 4d6 points
    of bludgeoning damage and 4d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 19 half). Creatures
    damaged by the gale must also succeed at a DC 19 Will saving throw or be confused
    for 1 round. The confusion is a sonic, mind-affecting, compulsion effect. The
    save DCs are Charisma-based.
  Eavesdropper's Veil (Su): A sishkanset can use its detect thoughts spell-like ability
    on any creature within 1 mile to which it has line of effect. Additionally, using
    detect thoughts or its whispering persecution ability does not end the sishkanset's
    invisibility.
  Insidious Winds (Su): A sishkanset's presence suffuses local winds, causing natural
    light winds within 5 miles of the sishkanset to increase to moderate (11-20 mph).
    Moderate or greater wind forces are unaffected. If the sishkanset is destroyed,
    natural wind conditions return within 1 hour.
  Whispering Persecution (Su): |-
    Sishkansets temporarily relieve their anguish by driving others to madness. As a full-round action, a sishkanset can wrap susurrating currents of ethereal wind around a creature within 5 miles to which it has line of effect. The currents deliver maddening ramblings audible only to the target creature, and the sishkanset must maintain the currents by remaining within 5 miles of the target and concentrating for 1 minute each day. After every 24 hours that a creature is the target of this ability, it must succeed at a DC 19 Will saving throw or take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage. Damage caused in this way cannot reduce a creature's Wisdom score below 1. A sishkanset can affect only one creature at a time with whispering persecution. This is a sonic, mind-affecting, curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
     Creatures able to see invisible or ethereal objects perceive the currents as translucent gray threads that ultimately lead to the sishkanset.
desc_long: |-
  Formed from the fabric of the Ethereal Plane, sishkansets are incorporeal reflections of mortal psyches. Born of the disorientation and despair of souls whose mortal vessels died isolated and buffeted by wilderness winds, sishkansets haunt sparsely settled frontiers. They wield the same winds that tormented their progenitors in their final moments; a sishkanset's presence disrupts the atmosphere for miles around, and though the natural winds they stoke are not inherently dangerous, they are maddeningly constant.

   Sishkansets sift through mortal thoughts in the hope of reassembling their own fragmented personalities, but their fundamentally incomplete nature makes this an unattainable goal. When a sishkanset's suffering becomes overwhelming, it visits its condition on others, slowly driving its victims insane through unending wind and discordant whispers.

   A sishkanset takes the form of an eerily tall and ghostly humanoid with dozens of tendrils trailing from the back of its head and shoulders. These tendrils reach into the Ethereal Plane, spreading the sishkanset's presence through the local atmosphere. A sishkanset's features are indistinct, but its elongated form often resembles the individual whose traveling soul incited the creature's formation from the Ethereal Plane.

   A sishkanset is about 8 feet tall and unnaturally thin.

##### Description

Formed from the fabric of the Ethereal Plane, sishkansets are _incorporeal_ reflections of mortal psyches. Born of the disorientation and despair of souls whose mortal vessels died isolated and buffeted by wilderness winds, sishkansets haunt sparsely settled frontiers. They wield the same winds that tormented their progenitors in their final moments; a _sishkanset_’s presence disrupts the atmosphere for miles around, and though the natural winds they stoke are not inherently dangerous, they are maddeningly constant.

Sishkansets _[[spells/Sift|sift]]_ through mortal thoughts in the hope of reassembling their own fragmented personalities, but their fundamentally incomplete nature makes this an unattainable goal. When a _sishkanset_’s suffering becomes overwhelming, it visits its condition on others, slowly driving its victims insane through unending wind and discordant whispers.

A _sishkanset_ takes the form of an eerily tall and ghostly humanoid with dozens of tendrils trailing from the back of its head and shoulders. These tendrils reach into the Ethereal Plane, spreading the _sishkanset_’s presence through the local atmosphere. A _sishkanset_’s features are indistinct, but its elongated form often resembles the individual whose traveling soul incited the creature’s formation from the Ethereal Plane.

A _sishkanset_ is about 8 feet tall and unnaturally thin.
