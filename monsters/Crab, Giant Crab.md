  Giant crabs behave much like their smaller cousins, feeding on both plant material like algae and fungus and animal matter such as fish, seabirds, and even unwary humanoids.

The coloration of a giant crab’s hard exoskeleton varies widely depending on species, and over time even shifts in response to its diet.
