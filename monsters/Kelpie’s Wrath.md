  Fighter Training (Ex): The herald counts its Hit Dice as fighter levels for the
    purpose of qualifying for feats and other abilities.
  Keelhaul (Ex): If the herald hits a creature with two or more incorporeal touch
    attacks in 1 round, it can perform a reposition combat maneuver as a free action
    without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the herald moves the target into
    or through a square adjacent to it (including over or under itself ), the target
    takes 1d6 points of slashing or bludgeoning damage (herald's choice) for every
    5 feet of this movement. If this movement results in the target being underwater,
    the target must hold its breath or begin to drown. Alternatively, if the herald
    can reposition the target to the center of its space, it can attempt to force
    the target into its cargo hold and snap the doors shut, holding the target in
    place as the swallow whole ability. The herald can hold up to four Medium or smaller
    creatures or one Large creature with this ability.
  Rush (Ex): Once per minute for 1 round, the herald can move at a swim speed of 150
    feet, even downward.
  Telekinesis (Su): The herald makes ranged attacks by telekinetically hurling objects
    or creatures on its deck as weapons. This ability functions as the spell telekinesis
    (CL 18th). It can use the ability on objects or creatures of up to 375 pounds,
    dealing 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds of the hurled object or creature. If
    the herald attempts to hurl a creature with this ability, that creature can resist
    the effect with a successful Will save (DC 18). The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  Besmara's herald is Kelpie's Wrath, a haunted ship that is a living being. It looks like a storm-battered pirate vessel with the skull and spine of some great sea creature mounted on the prow, with eerie lights f lickering on its deck and streaming from its masts. The ship is the source of many horror tales of abandoned ships found in the ocean or spectral ships crewed by ghosts, but it is actually an independent creature with a malign, vengeful intelligence. On the rare occasions when it comes to the mortal seas at Besmara's bidding, it usually does so to punish some buccaneer for a horrid blasphemy against the Pirate Queen. Far more often it is left to its own devices, sailing mortal waters, the Ethereal or Astral Planes, or strange dreamrealms in search of plunder, danger, and glory.

  The ship's origins are mysterious and legends about it are contradictory. In some stories it was originally the f lagship of a notorious pirate king who swore to forever serve Besmara, and when he finally died she merged his spirit with his ship so he could continue his service. Other tales tell of a demon-tainted kelpie that grew to a monstrous size and was kept as a beloved pet by the goddess like a mad dog until it was slain by adventurers and resurrected in this form to continue its predations. Still others speak of a devout priest-captain of Besmara who swore to bed no other woman so he could service the goddess in the afterlife, but then fell in love with a girl in a coastal village; according to this tale, the goddess cursed the priest to always roam the sea and never touch land so he would always pine for the love he could not have. The ship does not answer queries about its origin, and if pressed on the matter it has a habit of grabbing its interrogators, diving hundreds of feet under the water, and casually watching them gasp out the last of their air before it tears them limb from limb.

  The ship is completely animate and needs no crew- it can tie and release its lines; raise, lower, and adjust its sails; open or close all of its doors; and so on. It moves about foreign objects (such as cargo) using telekinesis, and it sometimes does the same to its rare passengers, slamming doors on hands or throwing people overboard if it feels a lack of respect. Though it has a wheel and rudder, it resists mortal attempts to steer it as if it were a mundane ship- something it considers very disrespectful.

##### Description

Besmara’s herald is _[[monsters/Kelpie’s Wrath|Kelpie’s Wrath]]_, a haunted ship that is a living being. It looks like a storm-battered pirate vessel with the skull and spine of some great sea creature mounted on the prow, with eerie lights f lickering on its deck and streaming from its masts. The ship is the source of many horror tales of abandoned ships found in the ocean or spectral ships crewed by ghosts, but it is actually an independent creature with a malign, vengeful intelligence. On the rare occasions when it comes to the mortal seas at Besmara’s bidding, it usually does so to punish some buccaneer for a horrid _[[spells/Blasphemy|blasphemy]]_ against the _[[npcs/Pirate Queen|Pirate Queen]]_. Far more often it is left to its own devices, sailing mortal waters, the Ethereal or Astral Planes, or strange dreamrealms in search of plunder, danger, and glory.

The ship’s origins are mysterious and legends about it are contradictory. In some stories it was originally the f lagship of a notorious _[[npcs/Pirate King|pirate king]]_ who swore to forever serve Besmara, and when he finally died she merged his spirit with his ship so he could continue his service. Other tales tell of a demon-tainted _[[monsters/Kelpie|kelpie]]_ that grew to a monstrous size and was kept as a beloved pet by the goddess like a mad _[[monsters/Dog|dog]]_ until it was slain by adventurers and resurrected in this form to continue its predations. Still others speak of a devout priest-captain of Besmara who swore to bed no other woman so he could service the goddess in the afterlife, but then fell in love with a girl in a coastal village; according to this tale, the goddess cursed the priest to always roam the sea and never touch land so he would always pine for the love he could not have. The ship does not answer queries about its origin, and if pressed on the matter it has a habit of grabbing its interrogators, diving hundreds of feet under the water, and casually watching them gasp out the last of their air before it tears them limb from limb.

The ship is completely animate and needs no crew— it can tie and release its lines; raise, lower, and adjust its sails; open or close all of its doors; and so on. It moves about foreign objects (such as cargo) using _telekinesis_, and it sometimes does the same to its rare passengers, slamming doors on hands or _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Throwing|throwing]]_ people overboard if it feels a lack of respect. Though it has a wheel and rudder, it resists mortal attempts to steer it as if it were a mundane ship— something it considers very disrespectful.
