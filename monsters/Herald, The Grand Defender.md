special_abilities:
  Ablative Adaptation (Su): As a standard action, the Grand Defender can shed its
    outer layer of metal, revealing a slightly smaller version of itself underneath.
    This new form may be made of cold iron (changing its DR to 15/cold iron), mithral
    (DR 15/silver), or iron (DR 15/adamantine, as normal). Its attacks count as this
    metal type for overcoming damage reduction. If the herald is brought to 0 hit
    points, it becomes inert; 1d4 hours after it last took damage, it sheds its outer
    layer and reanimates at half its normal hit points. Once shed, the outer layer
    decays into worthless powder over 1d4 minutes.
  Breath Weapon (Su): The herald's poisonous breath weapon functions like that of
    an iron golem (free action every 1d4 rounds, 10 ft. cube, Fort DC 19, 1d4 Con,
    2 consecutive saves). The save DC is Constitution-based. The cloud persists for
    1 round.
  Defender's Shield (Ex): The herald's shield is a +3 heavy steel shield, though it
    becomes nonmagical if the herald is destroyed or is no longer holding or wearing
    it.
  Hammer Storm (Ex): The herald can expel a volley of warhammers from its mouth, which
    functions like a breath weapon (30-foot cone, 15d6 bludgeoning damage plus Awesome
    Blow, Reflex 19 half, usable 1/day). If the herald is in its cold iron or mithral
    form, these hammers count as cold iron or silver, respectively. The herald can
    exclude any number of squares in the cone. The hammer storm creates 24 physical
    warhammers that persist after the instantaneous attack and may be used by creatures
    (though they're normal warhammers, not masterwork, cold iron, or mithral). The
    herald can spend 1 minute eating 24 warhammers (or an equivalent amount of metal
    such as that created by its ablative adaptation ability) to recharge this ability.
    The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Immunity to Magic (Su): The herald has the same immunity to magic as an iron golem.
desc_long: The Grand Defender is a powerful golem-like tomb that serves as the communal
  body and resting place of Torag's greatest dwarven heroes. It stands 18 feet tall
  and weighs approximately 10 tons.
