  Fall Apart (Su): As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, an ichkoh can cause
    all creatures within 30 feet of it to feel as if their bodies were falling apart
    unless they succeed at a DC 19 Will save. Those affected by this ability take
    1d3 points of Constitution damage. In addition, they take a -2 penalty on attack
    rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks for 1d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting
    effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Look of Fear (Su): A creature affected by an ichkoh's gaze is shaken for 1d4 rounds.
desc_long: |-
  Ichkohs savor the fear of the failure of the flesh, and enjoy tormenting those who take pride in their bodies. When an ichkoh selects victims, it torments them with the knowledge of how they failed to maintain their bodies in their youth. Sometimes an ichkoh pursues a single creature for years, encouraging increasingly self-destructive behavior that, if allowed to continue, can drive a victim to suicide. 

  An ichkoh stands 6 feet tall and weighs 140 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**Fall Apart (Su)** As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, an ichkoh can cause all creatures within 30 feet of it to feel as if their bodies were falling apart unless they succeed at a DC 19 Will save. Those affected by this ability take 1d3 points of Constitution damage. In addition, they take a –2 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks for 1d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Look of _Fear_ (Su)** A creature affected by an ichkoh’s _[[universal monster rules/Gaze|gaze]]_ is _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 1d4 rounds.

##### Description

Ichkohs savor the _fear_ of the failure of the flesh, and enjoy tormenting those who take pride in their bodies. When an ichkoh selects victims, it torments them with the knowledge of how they failed to maintain their bodies in their youth. Sometimes an ichkoh pursues a single creature for years, encouraging increasingly self-destructive behavior that, if allowed to continue, can drive a victim to suicide.

An ichkoh stands 6 feet tall and weighs 140 pounds.
