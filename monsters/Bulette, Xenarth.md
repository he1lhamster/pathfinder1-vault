title1: Bulette, Xenarth
is_3.5: true
desc_short: This huge beast rests atop four thick legs that end in sleek, curved claws,
  and its body is covered in red-hued armor plates that drip with foul ichor. Its
  eyes glow red like hot coals, and strange veins between its plates pulse and glow
  like flames. Along its spine, a slender armored crest peaks at mid-back, much like
  the top fin of a shark.

    ambushing them in advantageous terrain.

    They revel in the act of violence and eat everything they kill, if only to vomit
    it forth again later in a grisly and triumphant torrent.
  Morale: Xenarths fight to the death.

  Demon Ichor (Su): A slimy red ichor coats the xenarth's armored plates. Any weapon
    that touches a xenarth takes 3d8 points of acid damage from the corrosive demon
    essence, and the weapon's hardness does not reduce this damage. A magic weapon
    may attempt a DC 17 Reflex save to avoid taking this damage. A creature that strikes
    a xenarth with an unarmed attack, unarmed strike, melee touch spell, or natural
    weapon takes this damage unless the attacker makes a DC 17 Reflex save. The save
    DCs are Constitution-based.
  Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 23, initial damage 1d6 Con, secondary damage 2d6
    Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: The most feared bulette mutations are the xenarths. Also called ichor sharks,
  xenarths are an incredibly rare species of bulette that most believe long vanished
  from the world. Since the original bulettes were created with infusions of demon
  ichor, many have long associated them with demons despite the fact that they're
  simply magically created beasts. Xenarths, however, are actually demons. At the
  moment of the creation process when the fused animal parts were combined with demon
  ichor, xenarths were imbued with an excess of this essence, becoming demonic outsiders,
  creatures not of the Material Plane. Xenarths are covered in a slimy red ichor that
  burns like acid when touched and helps propel them through the soil much quicker
  than the bulette. Xenarths are brutal and even more frightening than their cousins.
  Bulettes eat to fuel an insatiable hunger-xenarths eat for the pure pleasure of
  destruction, and have been known to eat, regurgitate, and move on to other food.

##### Description

The most feared _[[monsters/Bulette|bulette]]_ mutations are the xenarths. Also _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ ichor sharks, xenarths are an incredibly rare species of _bulette_ that most believe long vanished from the world. Since the original bulettes were created with infusions of demon ichor, many have long associated them with demons despite the fact that they're simply magically created beasts. Xenarths, however, are actually demons. At the moment of the creation process when the fused animal parts were combined with demon ichor, xenarths were imbued with an excess of this essence, becoming demonic outsiders, creatures not of the Material Plane. Xenarths are covered in a slimy red ichor that burns like acid when touched and helps propel them through the soil much quicker than the _bulette_. Xenarths are brutal and even more frightening than their cousins. Bulettes eat to fuel an insatiable hunger—xenarths eat for the pure pleasure of _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_, and have been known to eat, regurgitate, and move on to other food.
