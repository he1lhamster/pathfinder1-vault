  Dazzling Brightness (Ex): A glass golem in an area of bright light dazzles any creature
    within 30 feet that sees it for 1 round (Fortitude DC 16 negates). Once a creature
    makes its save against this ability, it is immune to that golem's brightness for
    24 hours. The DC is Constitution-based.
  Immune to Magic (Ex): A glass golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability
    that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
    differently against a glass golem, as noted below. A shatter spell damages a glass
    golem as if it were a crystalline creature.A keen edge spell affects all of a
    glass golem's slam attacks as if they were slashing weapons.A magical attack that
    deals cold damage slows a glass golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds (no saving
    throw).A magical attack that deals fire damage ends any slow effect on the golem
    and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise
    deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal
    hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A glass golem gets no
    saving throw against fire effects.
  Reflect Spells (Ex): As a free action once every 1d4 rounds, a glass golem can align
    its internal structure to enhance its resistance to magic for 1 round. During
    this time, the golem reflects spells (even spells that function differently against
    the golem as described in its immune to magic ability) as if under the effect
    of a spell turning spell.
desc_long: |-
  A glass golem is a sizable guardian constructed by a powerful caster, usually in the shape of an armored humanoid. They are more common in desert lands where quartz-based sand is readily available, or in urban centers where glassblowing is commonplace.

  A typical glass golem is 10 feet tall and weighs 2,500 pounds.

  Stained Glass Golems (+0 CR): Divine casters sometimes build glass golems that resemble the windowpanes commonly found in temples. Thin and agile, these colorful beings often act as spies, wielding powers of stealth that their other counterparts do not possess. A stained glass golem has a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks.
