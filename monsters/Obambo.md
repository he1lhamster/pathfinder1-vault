title1: Obambo
desc_short: This spectral creature looks like a scarred and shriveled ruin of an ancient
  tribal elder, with skin caked with dirt and moss, and long white hair tangled with
  sticks. Sharp teeth fill its cackling mouth, and its eyes are tiny but bright and
  piercing. Jungle vines weave through its ghostly body, which appears stuffed with
  decaying leaves and other plant matter.

special_abilities:
  Jungle Animus (Su): As a full-round action, an obambo can invest its spirit into
    the land itself and cause the ground to rise up as a Huge mass of soil, mud, vines,
    roots, and vermin. In this form, it has the statistics of an advanced giant shambling
    mound, except it keeps its own hit points.
  Rejuvenation (Su): In most cases, it's difficult to destroy an obambo through simple
    combat, as the “destroyed” spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Only after its
    remains or place of death is found and appropriate funeral rites are performed
    does it rest in peace and not return.
  Speak with Vermin (Su): An obambo can communicate with vermin, similar to using
    speak with animals. Vermin can only communicate with instinct-level information.
  Thought Eater (Su): An obambo's touch drains 1d6 points of Intelligence and dazes
    the target for 1 round; a successful DC 24 Fortitude save negates the daze effect
    and halves the ability drain. The obambo gains 5 temporary hit points and a +1
    bonus on all Intelligence-based skill checks for 24 hours with each successful
    Intelligence drain; these benefits stack. A creature reduced to 0 Intelligence
    by this attack is polymorphed into a Diminutive vermin (Fortitude DC 24 negates;
    otherwise treat as baleful polymorph).
  Unnatural Aura (Su): Animals, both wild and domesticated, can sense the unnatural
    presence of an obambo at a distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly approach
    nearer than that and panic if forced to do so unless their master succeeds at
    a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. A panicked animal remains
    so while within 30 feet of the obambo.
desc_long: When a person wise in the lore of the jungle dies and is not buried or
  given a funeral, the jungle itself may embrace her spirit, creating an obambo (“forsaken
  one”). The embittered spirit seeps into the ground, the roots of plants, and the
  crawling things beneath, becoming one with the jungle itself. An obambo is cunning,
  spiteful, and treacherous, but it remembers its old role of teacher and storyteller,
  a duty and an obligation it both loves and loathes. While dealing with an obambo
  is dangerous, they are known to assist those in need, if supplicants can meet the
  obambo's price.

##### Description

When a person wise in the lore of the jungle dies and is not buried or given a funeral, the jungle itself may embrace her spirit, creating an _obambo_ (“forsaken one”). The embittered spirit seeps into the ground, the roots of plants, and the crawling things beneath, becoming one with the jungle itself. An _obambo_ is _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cunning|cunning]]_, _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Spiteful|spiteful]]_, and treacherous, but it remembers its old role of teacher and storyteller, a duty and an obligation it both loves and loathes.
