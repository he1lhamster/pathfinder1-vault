  Telepathic Feedback (Su): As a standard action, a queen can unleash debilitating
    telepathic feedback. Those within her telepathic range who are not members of
    her hive must succeed at a DC 29 Will save or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls,
    saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks for 1 minute. A creature that
    succeeds at the save cannot be affected by telepathic feedback for 24 hours. This
    is a mindaffecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: A formian queen is the embodiment of the hive and the key to its success,
  as a hive's fate is tied to her ability to both populate it and successfully guide
  it. The formian queen does this while her massive body is bound to a central chamber
  dedicated to her nearly constant egg laying. The queen's enormous abdomen squeezes
  out egg after egg as she meets with her myrmarchs to plan defense, strategy, and
  trade negotiations. While the queen may be sheltered, she is not blind. When necessary,
  she possesses the minds of her children to see for herself what occurs beyond her
  central chamber, and more active queens use this ability to confront intruders directly.

##### Description

A formian queen is the embodiment of the hive and the key to its success, as a hive’s fate is tied to her ability to both populate it and successfully guide it. The formian queen does this while her massive body is bound to a central chamber dedicated to her nearly constant egg laying. The queen’s enormous abdomen squeezes out egg after egg as she meets with her myrmarchs to plan defense, strategy, and trade negotiations. While the queen may be sheltered, she is not blind. When necessary, she possesses the minds of her children to see for herself what occurs beyond her central chamber, and more active queens use this ability to confront intruders directly.
