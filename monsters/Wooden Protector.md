special_abilities:
  Create Weapon (Ex): A wooden protector can, as a free action, use its body to fashion
    any simple or martial weapon composed almost entirely of wood (such as bows, quarterstaffs,
    and spears). Weapons created in this way cannot be sundered or disarmed. If the
    weapon created requires ammunition (such as bows), the wooden protector takes
    1 point of damage each time the weapon is fired. This damage can be regenerated
    as normal. Created weapons can be reabsorbed as a free action or used to create
    a new weapon.
  Grasp of Wood (Su): As a standard action, a wooden protector can focus its gaze
    on a single target within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 17 Reflex save or
    be encased in a web of wooden branches. Those who fail are entangled and cannot
    move, but can escape with a successful DC 17 Strength or Escape Artist check.
    The branches last for 1d6 rounds before becoming brittle and breaking. The DC
    is Strength-based.
  Natural Movement (Ex): A wooden protector may move through any sort of undergrowth
    at its normal speed without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. This
    ability extends to magically manipulated undergrowth such as entangle and wall
    of thorns.
  Regeneration (Su): Fire deals lethal damage to a wooden protector.
desc_long: Undying guardians of forests, wooden protectors form when druids call upon
  nature to defend itself, when the druids' own personal power cannot hope to defend
  the wilds from what opposes them. As tireless defenders, wooden protectors frequently
  outlive their callers, but never stray far from where they were created.
