  Acid (Ex): The digestive acid that covers a gray ooze dissolves metals and organic
    material, but not stone. Each slam and constrict attack deals 1d6 additional acid
    damage. Armor or clothing worn by a creature grappled by a gray ooze takes the
    same amount of acid damage unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex saving
    throw. A wooden or metal weapon that strikes a gray ooze takes 1d6 acid damage
    unless the weapon's wielder succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex save. The ooze's touch
    deals 12 points of acid damage per round to wooden or metal objects, but the ooze
    must remain in contact with the material for 1 full round in order to deal this
    damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  Transparent (Ex): Due to its lack of vivid coloration, a gray ooze is difficult
    to discern from its surroundings in most environments. A DC 15 Perception check
    is required to notice the gray ooze. Any creature that fails to notice a gray
    ooze and walks into it automatically suffers damage as if struck by the ooze's
    slam attack and is immediately subject to a grab attempt by the ooze.
desc_long: |-
  Slinking their way through cold swamps and bleary marshlands, or sometimes even dungeons and caverns, gray oozes consume any organic materials they encounter. Despite its lack of intelligence, the gray ooze is a most problematic creature due to its transparency. While the ooze cannot easily climb walls or swim, its habit of lurking in the thick mud that lines the banks of marsh pools or lying in harmless-looking pools on dull-colored dungeon floors makes it dangerously easy to overlook and step on.

  Some sages believe that the gray ooze is the result of a failed alchemical experiment, while others postulate that the first gray oozes spontaneously arose from a cesspit of magical detritus. Of course, these theories that gray oozes are not living organisms, but rather the alchemical result of an unfortunate mixture of rare caustic fluids and magical waste, are derided by many who dwell in areas plagued by the creatures but which do not have a long history of magical pollution.

##### Description

Slinking their way through cold swamps and bleary marshlands, or sometimes even dungeons and caverns, _[[monsters/Gray|gray]]_ oozes consume any organic materials they encounter. Despite its lack of intelligence, the _gray ooze_ is a most problematic creature due to its transparency. While the ooze cannot easily _[[universal monster rules/Climb|climb]]_ walls or swim, its habit of lurking in the thick mud that lines the banks of marsh pools or lying in harmless-looking pools on dull-colored dungeon floors makes it dangerously easy to _[[spells/Overlook|overlook]]_ and step on.

Some sages believe that the _gray ooze_ is the result of a failed alchemical experiment, while others postulate that the first _gray_ oozes spontaneously arose from a cesspit of magical detritus. Of course, these theories that _gray_ oozes are not living organisms, but rather the alchemical result of an unfortunate mixture of rare caustic fluids and magical waste, are derided by many who dwell in areas plagued by the creatures but which do not have a long history of magical pollution.
