  Acid Injection (Ex): When a flumph strikes an opponent with its spikes, it injects
    a burning, irritating acid that deals 1d4 points of acid damage immediately and
    another 1d4 points of acid damage on the round after the attack. The target can
    end the acid's effects by submerging the wound in water for a round or by being
    treated with a DC 15 Heal check. A creature that grapples or swallows the flumph
    takes this acid damage automatically every round it maintains this contact with
    a living flumph.
  Stench Spray (Ex): A flumph can spray a 20-foot line of foul- smelling liquid once
    every 1d4 rounds. This spray functions like the stench universal monster ability,
    except it only affects creatures struck by the spray, which must make a DC 11
    Fortitude save or be sickened for 5 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
    Alternatively, the flumph can concentrate the spray on a single target within
    5 feet. To use this version of its stench spray, the flumph must succeed at a
    ranged touch attack (+5 for most flumphs). If the target is hit, it must make
    a DC 11 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 5 rounds; otherwise, it is sickened
    for 5 rounds. The odor from this spray lingers in the area and on all creatures
    struck for 1d4 hours, and can be detected at a range of 100 feet (creatures with
    the scent ability can smell it at double this range).
desc_long: |-
  Come from distant stars to protect unprepared worlds from cosmic horrors, flumphs are jellyfish-like creatures that float in the air and hunt with acidic spikes growing from their undersides. Gentle at heart, flumphs understand that their appearance often terrifies viewers, and thus conceal themselves and observe neighboring settlements from afar, only revealing themselves when absolutely necessary. They also know full well the limitations of their fragile forms, and rather than directly opposing the horrors they seek to defeat, they prefer to recruit and advise heroes to tackle these dangerous tasks instead.

  Flumphs float and speak via a constant flow of air through tiny pores in their white bodies, emitting a rhythmic puffing whenever they're aloft. Typical flumphs weigh 15 pounds and are 3 feet across. Flumphs deeply revere dreams, seeing them as omens and portents. While they normally mate and reproduce on the world of their birth, flumphs occasionally engage in a ritual called the Seeding, in which seed pods are flung into outer space in order to provide other planets with guardians.

**_Stench_ Spray (Ex)** A _flumph_ can spray a 20-foot line of foul- smelling liquid once every 1d4 rounds. This spray functions like the _stench_ universal monster ability, except it only affects creatures struck by the spray, which must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or be _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ for 5 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Alternatively, the _flumph_ can concentrate the spray on a single target within 5 feet. To use this version of its _stench_ spray, the _flumph_ must succeed at a ranged touch attack (+5 for most flumphs). If the target is hit, it must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or become _[[conditions/Nauseated|nauseated]]_ for 5 rounds; otherwise, it is _sickened_ for 5 rounds. The odor from this spray lingers in the area and on all creatures struck for 1d4 hours, and can be detected at a range of 100 feet (creatures with the _[[universal monster rules/Scent|scent]]_ ability can smell it at double this range).

##### Description

Come from distant stars to protect unprepared worlds from cosmic horrors, flumphs are jellyfish-like creatures that float in the air and hunt with acidic spikes _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Growing|growing]]_ from their undersides. Gentle at heart, flumphs understand that their appearance often terrifies viewers, and thus conceal themselves and observe neighboring settlements from afar, only revealing themselves when absolutely necessary. They also know full well the limitations of their fragile forms, and rather than directly opposing the horrors they seek to defeat, they prefer to _[[npcs/Recruit|recruit]]_ and advise heroes to tackle these dangerous tasks instead.

Flumphs float and speak via a constant flow of air through tiny pores in their white bodies, emitting a rhythmic puffing whenever they’re aloft. Typical flumphs weigh 15 pounds and are 3 feet across. Flumphs deeply revere dreams, seeing them as omens and portents. While they normally mate and reproduce on the world of their birth, flumphs occasionally engage in a ritual _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ the Seeding, in which seed pods are flung into outer space in order to provide other planets with guardians.
