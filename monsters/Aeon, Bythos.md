  Aging Strike (Su): If a bythos strikes a living target with two slam attacks in

    save. The victim gains all of the penalties from this aging and none of the bonuses.
    A venerable victim targeted by this ability dies if it fails a DC 24 Fortitude
    save. This process is reversible with greater restoration, limited wish, miracle,
    or wish. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Confusion Gaze (Su): Confusion for 1d4 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 24 negates.
    The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Temporal Strike (Su): As a standard action, a bythos can touch a creature or object
    to displace it from time. If the target fails a DC 24 Fortitude save, it disappears
    from the present moment and reappears in the same location 1d4 rounds later as
    if no time had passed. If an object occupies that space, the creature appears
    in the closest available space to its original location-this displacement does
    not cause the creature any additional harm. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  The bythos are guardians of time and planar travel-indeed, to bythos, the act of aging is nothing more than a highly specialized method of travel. Although bythos themselves have no additional method of traveling through time, they scour the multiverse, hunting for creatures that do have the ability to time-travel and may have abused this ability. 

  Far more often, though, bythos seek out abuses of planar travel, such as tears in reality, regions where planes overlap, or creatures that abuse the use of planar travel. In some cases, such distortions are ignored, but in others, a bythos or even a full tribunal comes to assess and repair the damage. In most cases, “repair” is analogous to the death of the creature responsible for the distortions, but placing such creatures in temporal stasis can also solve the problem. 

  While a bythos's body may seem to be made of smoke and vapor, it is strangely solid to the touch, feeling not dissimilar to dry stone. A bythos is 13 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**Aging Strike (Su)** If a bythos strikes a living target with two slam attacks in a single round, the bythos ages the creature, causing it to advance to the next age category (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 169) if it fails a DC 24 Fortitude save. The victim gains all of the penalties from this aging and none of the bonuses. A venerable victim targeted by this ability dies if it fails a DC 24 Fortitude save. This process is reversible with greater _[[spells/Restoration|restoration]]_, _[[spells/Limited Wish|limited wish]]_, _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_, or _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**_Confusion_ _Gaze_ (Su)** _Confusion_ for 1d4 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 24 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Temporal Strike (Su)** As a standard action, a bythos can touch a creature or object to displace it from time. If the target fails a DC 24 Fortitude save, it disappears from the present moment and reappears in the same location 1d4 rounds later as if no time had passed. If an object occupies that space, the creature appears in the closest available space to its original location—this _[[spells/Displacement|displacement]]_ does not cause the creature any additional _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_. The save DC is Charisma-based.

##### Description

The bythos are guardians of time and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Planar|planar]]_ travel—indeed, to bythos, the act of aging is nothing more than a highly specialized method of travel. Although bythos themselves have no additional method of traveling through time, they scour the multiverse, hunting for creatures that do have the ability to time-travel and may have abused this ability.

Far more often, though, bythos seek out abuses of _planar_ travel, such as tears in reality, regions where planes overlap, or creatures that abuse the use of _planar_ travel. In some cases, such distortions are ignored, but in others, a bythos or even a full tribunal comes to assess and repair the damage. In most cases, “repair” is analogous to the death of the creature responsible for the distortions, but placing such creatures in _temporal stasis_ can also solve the problem.

While a bythos’s body may seem to be made of smoke and vapor, it is strangely solid to the touch, feeling not dissimilar to dry stone. A bythos is 13 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds.
