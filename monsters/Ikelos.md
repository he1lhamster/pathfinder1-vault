special_abilities:
  Dream-Phased (Su): An ikelos is typically invisible. Creatures that are fatigued
    or under the effects of see invisibility can see an ikelos, but its nature is
    partially obscured. An ikelos gains the benefit of partial concealment against
    such creatures. In addition, its claws deal 3d6 points of damage to such creatures,
    instead of 2d6. Creatures that are exhausted or under the effects of true seeing
    can see the ikelos clearly. They suffer no miss chance when striking the ikelos.
    However, an ikelos's claws deal 4d6 points of damage to such creatures, instead
    of 2d6.
  Fear Dependency (Ex): An ikelos is a creature of nightmares, and it depends completely
    on fear for its sustenance. An ikelos doesn't recover hit point damage naturally
    and cannot heal by any means other than its feed on fear ability.
  Feed on Fear (Su): Anytime an ikelos is within 15 feet of a dying creature or a
    creature subject to a fear effect, it gains fast healing 5.
  Frightful Gaze (Su): Creatures within 30 feet that meet an ikelos's gaze must succeed
    at a DC 17 Will save or be paralyzed with fear for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting
    fear effect and a paralysis effect. A creature that succeeds at this saving throw
    is immune to the frightful gaze of that ikelos for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Lethargy Aura (Su): An ikelos exudes an aura that makes nearby creatures increasingly
    lethargic. Creatures that fail a DC 17 Fortitude save become fatigued. Fatigued
    creatures that fail a DC 17 Fortitude save become exhausted. The effects of the
    aura end 10 rounds after an affected creature exits the aura. An ikelos can suppress
    or reactivate its aura as a free action. Ikeloses are immune to this ability.
    The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  Ikeloses are monsters that lurk just out of the sight of insomniacs; they are nightmares that freeze the body even as the mind recoils in horror.

  To those who are fully awake, an ikelos remains unseen, a silently invisible nightmare that can travel undetected wherever it pleases. Only supernatural vision or drowsy eyes perceive these creatures. Ikeloses are painted in the colors of dreams-constantly warping hues that cannot be reproduced with light or pigments, and as such are impossible to accurately remember.

  An ikelos is frightening in aspect, appearing as a distorted humanoid with large eyes and elongated limbs. Its flat, ovoid face has the barest hint of a nose, and its mouth is a barely noticeable seam until distended to reveal row upon row of sharp teeth. An ikelos's short wings are unnecessary for its flight, but when unfolded, they give the creature the illusion of size. Many a dream-addled victim has mistaken an ikelos for a sinister fiend or an avenging angel.

  Ikeloses are commonly the size of a human, though both larger and smaller members of their kind exist. As incorporeal beings, they are entirely weightless.

##### Description

Ikeloses are monsters that lurk just out of the sight of insomniacs; they are nightmares that _[[universal monster rules/Freeze|freeze]]_ the body even as the mind recoils in horror.

To those who are fully awake, an _ikelos_ remains _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Unseen|unseen]]_, a silently _invisible_ _[[spells/Nightmare|nightmare]]_ that can travel undetected wherever it pleases. Only supernatural _[[spells/Vision|vision]]_ or drowsy eyes perceive these creatures. Ikeloses are painted in the colors of dreams—constantly warping hues that cannot be reproduced with light or pigments, and as such are impossible to accurately remember.

An _ikelos_ is frightening in aspect, appearing as a distorted humanoid with large eyes and elongated limbs. Its flat, ovoid face has the barest hint of a nose, and its mouth is a barely noticeable seam until distended to reveal row upon row of sharp teeth. An _ikelos_’s short wings are unnecessary for its _[[universal monster rules/Flight|flight]]_, but when unfolded, they give the creature the illusion of size. Many a dream-addled victim has mistaken an _ikelos_ for a sinister fiend or an avenging angel.

Ikeloses are commonly the size of a human, though both larger and smaller members of their kind exist. As _incorporeal_ beings, they are entirely weightless.
