  Calming Fragrance (Su): A supernaturally sweet perfume that calms the nerves and
    blunts aggression constantly surrounds an alraune to a radius of 60 feet. Any
    creature in this area of effect must make a DC 24 Will save at the start of its
    turn to avoid falling under the effects of calm emotions for 1 round. Creatures
    that could be attracted to the alraune's current apparent gender take a -2 penalty
    on this Will save, while all other creatures gain a +2 bonus on the save. This
    is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Feed (Ex): An alraune's roots can feed on a helpless or willing target. At the end
    of an hour of feeding, the victim takes 1d6 points of both Constitution and Intelligence
    drain, and the alraune heals 3d6 points of damage.
desc_long: |-
  An alraune relies on its supernaturally soothing odor to render enemies incapable of making hostile acts against it-even if the alraune attacks a foe, its calming scent can wipe away any thoughts of violence from its prey. At rest, an alraune appears to be merely a large thorny plant with a single enormous and brightly colored flower at its center.

  When an alraune attacks, its thorny vines lash out and its flower blooms, revealing an attractive, green-skinned humanoid form within. An alraune's apparent gender can vary even from encounter to encounter, for the plant can reshape its humanoid portions as it desires to increase the likelihood of setting its victims at ease. Regardless of the plant's apparent gender, it is itself asexual and reproduces (typically once or twice per decade) by budding a single offspring over the course of a spring season.

  Despite their appearance, alraunes are quite mobile (capable of walking almost like a spider upon their numerous long roots and thorny vines). They hunt by using commune with nature to locate potential prey, preferring humanoid flesh over all others. When an alraune needs prey, it uses its mind-affecting abilities to convince foes to dig their own graves and bury themselves-once a foe is helplessly buried in the soil, the alraune can feed from it via its flesh-burrowing roots, converting the victim's blood and memories into the strange nutrients it so craves.

##### Description

An _alraune_ relies on its supernaturally soothing odor to render enemies incapable of making hostile acts against it—even if the _alraune_ attacks a foe, its _calming_ _[[universal monster rules/Scent|scent]]_ can wipe away any thoughts of violence from its prey. At rest, an _alraune_ appears to be merely a large thorny plant with a single enormous and brightly colored flower at its center.

When an _alraune_ attacks, its thorny vines lash out and its flower blooms, revealing an attractive, green-skinned humanoid form within. An _alraune_’s apparent gender can vary even from encounter to encounter, for the plant can reshape its humanoid portions as it desires to increase the likelihood of setting its victims at ease. Regardless of the plant’s apparent gender, it is itself asexual and reproduces (typically once or twice per decade) by budding a single offspring over the course of a spring season.

Despite their appearance, alraunes are quite mobile (capable of walking almost like a spider upon their numerous long roots and thorny vines).
