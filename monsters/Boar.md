  Much more ill-tempered and dangerous than their domesticated kin, boars are omnivorous creatures common to temperate forests, although they are not unknown in tropical climes. Other variants exist as well, such as the particularly ugly warthogs that dwell in tropical plains and savannahs. Boars are often hunted for their flesh, which is considered delicious by most humanoids. Those who hunt boars often do so with a special spear fitted with a cross beam to prevent an impaled boar from pushing forward along the spear shaft to gore its tormentor.

  The boar's stubborn nature and habit of eating even bones makes it well suited as a pet for certain folk. Many thieves' guilds keep boars for the disposal of bodies, while orc tribes let them run loose in their lairs, where they do a relatively good job at keeping these warrens clean of refuse.

  A boar is four feet long and weighs 200 pounds.

##### Description

Much more ill-tempered and dangerous than their domesticated kin, boars are omnivorous creatures common to temperate forests, although they are not _[[monsters/Unknown|unknown]]_ in tropical climes. Other variants exist as well, such as the particularly ugly warthogs that dwell in tropical plains and savannahs. Boars are often hunted for their flesh, which is considered delicious by most humanoids. Those who hunt boars often do so with a special _[[items/Weapon/Spear|spear]]_ fitted with a cross beam to prevent an impaled _[[monsters/Boar|boar]]_ from pushing forward along the _spear_ shaft to gore its tormentor.

The _boar_’s stubborn nature and habit of eating even bones makes it well suited as a pet for certain folk. Many thieves’ guilds keep boars for the disposal of bodies, while _[[monsters/Orc|orc]]_ tribes let them run loose in their lairs, where they do a relatively good job at keeping these warrens clean of refuse.

A _boar_ is four feet long and weighs 200 pounds.
