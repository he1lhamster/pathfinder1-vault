### Special Abilities

**Bloodthirst (Su)** A _[[monsters/Leechroot|leechroot]]_ can absorb blood

directly from its victims’ cuts and from the soil

on which that blood has dripped. The _leechroot_

gains _[[universal monster rules/Fast Healing|fast healing]]_ equal to the number of

creatures with the _bleed_ condition within its

reach (if any).

**Bloody _Sap_ (Su)** The viscous resin

that exudes from a _leechroot_’s

tentacles is infused

with negative energy,

preventing both natural

and magical healing.

The DC of the _[[spells/Heal|Heal]]_ check

to stop the bleeding from

a _leechroot_’s attacks

increases by 2. While the

_bleed_ damage persists,

any magical healing

requires a successful DC 15

caster level check or the

spell or ability has no effect

on the bleeding creature.

**Drag Under (Ex)** As part of an action to maintain a grapple,

a _leechroot_ can move the _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ creature up to 5 feet

(within the _leechroot_’s reach) and bury it partially into the

ground. The buried creature is _[[conditions/Pinned|pinned]]_ and can’t receive

help to break free from the grapple. A buried opponent that

escapes the grapple remains _pinned_ unless it digs itself

out with a successful DC 10 Strength check attempted as a

move action.

**Earth Barrier (Ex)** A _leechroot_ burrowing 5 feet below the

surface is partially visible, can make attacks using its

normal reach, and gains concealment and partial cover.

It can be uprooted with a successful drag combat

maneuver. It may _burrow_ back under the earth as a move

action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

##### Description

Leechroots emerge from the remains of plants poisoned

by the blood-drenched soils of war-torn forests. Chaotic

intertwinings of rotten roots, these monstrosities quickly

spread their curse, soaking other dead plants in their _sap_

to spawn horrid offspring. A _leechroot_ is driven solely by

an insatiable thirst for blood. It hides among undergrowth

and below the earth while waiting for unwary prey. With

its razor-sharp roots, a _leechroot_ slashes at anything that

comes its way, snatching victims and feeding directly from

their wounds. The absorbed blood mutates into a thick,

dark-red _sap_ that runs through the _leechroot_ and oozes

from its unhallowed body, helping to _heal_ and sustain

the predatory creature.

An adult _leechroot_ averages about 12 feet across

(not including its thick, lashing _[[spells/Root|root]]_ appendages)

and weighs 700 pounds. By consuming

enough blood, however, leechroots can grow

significantly larger.
