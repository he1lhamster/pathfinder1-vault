# Anisydaemon
This fiend has pitch-black, rubbery skin pulled taut over an

immense frame. Arms tipped with glistening claws hang past

the creature’s knees, and two constantly whispering mouths rest

on its eyeless face.

### Special Abilities

**Aura of Worry (Su)** Anisydaemons project a 30-foot aura of

anxiety and insecurity. Each creature within 30 feet of the

daemon must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be affected

by _crushing despair_ for as long as it remains within the

aura. Creatures that fail their save remain affected by

the aura for 1d4+1 rounds after leaving the radius. The

_anisydaemon_ gains _[[universal monster rules/Fast Healing|Fast Healing]]_ 5 for as long as at least

one creature is affected by its aura. Additionally, creatures

that fail their save cannot sleep or receive any benefits of

rest while under the effects of the aura. An _anisydaemon_

can activate or deactivate this ability as a free action. The

save DC is Charisma-based.

**Devour Soul (Ex)** Any creature that dies while affected by one

of the _anisydaemon_’s mind-affecting abilities—including its

aura of worry—has its soul devoured by the fiend’s second

mouth. That creature cannot be resurrected by any effect

short of _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_, _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_, or direct intervention from a deity

while the _anisydaemon_ lives. Creatures whose souls have

been devoured by an _anisydaemon_ can be resurrected

normally if the _anisydaemon_ is slain.

**Hide in Plain Sight (Ex)** An _anisydaemon_ can use the Stealth

skill even while being observed. As long as it’s standing in

an area of at least dim light or _shadow_, an _anisydaemon_

can hide itself from view without actually hiding behind

anything. This ability has no effect if the _anisydaemon_ is

not in an area of at least dim light or in an area of _shadow_

of at least Medium size.
**_Shadow_ _Possession_ (Ex)** As a standard action that provokes

an attack of opportunity if the target is aware of the

daemon, an _anisydaemon_ can enter the _shadow_ of any

creature to which it is currently adjacent. While within

a _shadow_, the _anisydaemon_ is considered to be sharing

its target’s space, though while the daemon is within

a _shadow_, neither creature takes any penalties from

squeezing. The _anisydaemon_ can still affect creatures

within 30 feet of itself with its aura of worry, though

the daemon can target only the _shadow_’s owner with

its _psychic magic_ or _spell-like abilities_. While within a

_shadow_, an _anisydaemon_ is considered _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ and

takes half damage from spells and magic weapons. _[[monsters/Ghost|Ghost]]_

touch weapons affect it normally. An _anisydaemon_ that

dies while possessing a creature’s _shadow_ is immediately

ejected to a random empty space adjacent to the creature.

An _anisydaemon_ can leave a _shadow_ it is possessing as a

move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

If it does so, it is ejected into a free space of its choice

adjacent to the creature whose _shadow_ it was possessing.

When an _anisydaemon_ is possessing a creature’s _shadow_,

that creature cannot benefit from morale bonuses of any

kind. An _anisydaemon_ can use its Stealth skill to hide while

within a _shadow_.
**Sunlight Weakness (Ex)** An _anisydaemon_ exposed to

natural sunlight is unable to use any of its _psychic magic_

or _spell-like abilities_ and cannot project its aura of worry.

An _anisydaemon_ possessing a creature’s _shadow_ does

not count as being in direct sunlight, even if the creature

whose _shadow_ it’s possessing is.

##### Description

Anisydaemons, or “worry daemons,” represent death by

stress and anxiety. Their work can be seen in the artisan

who drives herself to death because she fears her work

will never be good enough, or through the husband

making himself sick wondering if his partner secretly

has a lover and analyzing every detail of every interaction

until his mind can no longer take the strain.

Anisydaemons average around 14 feet tall and weigh

about 1 ton. Occasionally, some anisydaemons reach truly

monstrous sizes after coaxing countless victims to their

deaths. These fiends often grow additional mouths on

other parts of their bodies, such as their hands or torsos,

which magnify the power of their _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ whispers.

Despite their bulk, those attempting to escape an

_anisydaemon_ discover the fiends can _[[spells/Squeeze|squeeze]]_ into

impossibly small spaces in pursuit.
