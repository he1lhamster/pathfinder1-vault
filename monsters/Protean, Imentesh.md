    as a swift action, but if it does so, it is affected by the warpwave as well unless
    it resists the effects with its own Fortitude save. See page 213 for a list of
    possible effects caused by a warpwave. The save DC is Constitution-based.

  Missionaries of chaos and heralds of reality's eventual unraveling, imenteshes are the proteans most likely to be encountered outside of Limbo. Despite their sometimes loquacious and courtly manner, imenteshes' entropic agenda is ever at the front of their minds, and this inherent madness is evident in the soft, telepathic susurrus that constantly surrounds them, threatening to warp the minds of the weak-willed.

  An imentesh is 15 feet long and weighs 1,200 pounds.
