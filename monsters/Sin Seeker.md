##### Description

Believed to have been bred centuries ago by zealous priests and inquisitors, sin seekers are living creatures with a supernatural ability to detect the _scent_ of varying degrees of morality. Originally small forest swine known for their _[[spells/Acute Senses|acute senses]]_ of smell, these unfortunate creatures were subjected to a magical mutation similar in practice to fleshwarping. The priests’ goal was to use these new creations to sniff out the supporters of _[[feats/Rival|rival]]_ faiths, identifying them by their hidden sins.

In the centuries following their initial creation, various sects throughout Golarion maintained small _sin seeker_ breeding programs. Many of these were aimed at _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Culling|culling]]_ impious members from the ranks of the clergy, though many evil sects used sin seekers as torture and _[[spells/Interrogation|interrogation]]_ aids. Today, small populations of sin seekers still survive in monasteries throughout Golarion, and adventurers of all alignments continue to keep them as familiars. Sin seekers are usually about 12 to 18 inches long, with a 2-foot wingspan. They weigh between 3 and 5 pounds.
