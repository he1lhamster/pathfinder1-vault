##### Description

Born of tragedy and sorrow that have warped into hatred

and fury, tiyanaks are formed from the souls of infants

or young children that died near locales tainted with

strong necromantic energies or demonic presences. The

young soul blends with the corrupted energies, birthing a

stunted and mocking apparition of the deceased, obsessed

with devouring nearby sentient life. Humanoid in shape,

tiyanaks resemble gray-skinned children with shriveled

skin, deformed limbs, and patchy hair. A _tiyanak_’s arms

end in sharp claws and their mouths are lined with rows of

needlelike teeth. A _tiyanak_ typically reaches a height of only

2-1/2 feet, but weighs between 50 and 75 pounds. Tiyanaks

use _telepathy_ to communicate their own wretched anger to

all those that come close, and infuse their teeth and claws

with despair, making them sharper than any blade.

Tiyanaks hunger for the blood of humanoids, and use

their mimicry to emulate the sounds of crying children,

attempting to lure unsuspecting people to their side.

Once one of these helpful souls draw close, a _tiyanak_

either tries to dispatch its prey with _natural attacks_, or

uses its _suggestion_ ability to convince its target to bring

it closer to a humanoid settlement of any kind, where it

can torment the family that takes it in and find additional

victims. Against multiple enemies, a _tiyanak_ uses its

_crushing despair_ and _shout_ _spell-like abilities_ before picking

a specific target and attempting to gorge itself on its

victim’s blood. Despite their single-minded hatefulness,

tiyanaks will f lee if overpowered, but they typically do

not wander far from their point of origin. They have not

entirely forgotten the children they once were, and

though they loathe their former communities,

the sorrowful echoes of their lives make them

reticent to move far beyond the places they

once thought of as home.
