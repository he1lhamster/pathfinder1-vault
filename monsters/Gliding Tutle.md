  Glide (Ex): A gliding turtle can't use its fly speed to hover. When flying, a gliding
    turtle must end its movement at least 5 feet lower in elevation than where it
    started.
  Gliding Charge (Ex): While gliding, a gliding turtle can ram into a creature. When
    it does, it makes a charge attack against a creature it can reach with its speed.
    If the attack hits, it deals 2d6+3 points of bludgeoning damage and the turtle
    can immediately perform a bull rush combat maneuver as a free action against its
    target without provoking attacks of opportunity. The gliding turtle immediately
    stops gliding after this attack, landing on the ground and, if applicable, taking
    falling damage as if it deliberately jumped.
  Shell (Ex): As a move action, a gliding turtle can retract its limbs and head into
    its shell. It can't move or attack while in this state, but its armor bonus from
    natural armor increases by 2 as long as it does. Emerging from its shell is a
    move action.
desc_long: The gliding turtles of Azlant evolved thin layers of skin that connect
  their limbs to their shells and allow them to glide from ridges and drop onto unsuspecting
  prey. A gliding turtle is about 7 feet long and weighs over 1,000 pounds.
