  Bristles (Ex): A creature that attacks a caterpillar with a natural attack or non-reach
    melee weapon must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex save or take damage as if the caterpillar

    includes a +4 racial bonus.

desc_long: Blood caterpillars are among the largest of giant caterpillars. These massive
  vermin draw sustenance from rotting meat in the same way many butterflies eat rotting
  fruit. Behind their mandibles are spinnerets that allow them to manipulate silk,
  which the caterpillars can discharge to spin webs and immobilize their prey. Their
  venom weakens the muscles of creatures exposed to it, aiding the caterpillars in
  restraining and devouring even large, strong, and agile prey.
