# Urhag
This bat-like creature’s body is mostly a large, toothy maw, held

aloft by leathery wings. Its whip-thin tail ends in a slender stinger.

### Special Abilities

**Gnaw into Flesh (Ex)** When the _[[monsters/Urhag|urhag]]_ grapples a creature, it gnaws into that creature’s flesh, eventually hollowing it out to serve as a host. An _urhag_ that grapples a foe and chooses to damage the foe with an additional grapple check deals twice its normal bite damage (2d6+6 for most urhags) plus 2 points of Strength damage as it consumes the victim’s muscle and sinew.

**Infest Flesh (Su)** If the _urhag_ kills a _Medium_ or larger creature it is grappling, it slithers into the creature’s body as a free action, sliding its tendrils into the victim’s limbs and controlling the body like a puppet. This functions similarly to a greater _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_ spell, except that the creature uses the _urhag_’s Strength, Dexterity, and hit points instead of its own, and the _urhag_’s tail emerges from the host’s mouth like a blistered tongue, allowing it to make sting attacks. If the host body is slain, the _urhag_ emerges as a free action but is _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1 round. Otherwise, this effect lasts for 3 days or until the _urhag_ emerges as a standard action. When the effect ends or the _urhag_ emerges, the corpse collapses into rotten scraps of infected flesh. Anyone who touches these scraps is exposed to red plague. An _urhag_ can infest a recently dead body (one killed within an hour) with 3 full rounds of gnawing.

**Red Plague (Ex)** Whenever an _urhag_ hits with its sting attack, it inflicts a hideous infection. Creatures suffering from red plague quickly develop large, red, pus-leaking blisters across their bodies; when a creature dies of red plague, all of these blisters pop at once, each releasing a tadpole-sized larval _urhag_. Red plague is a disease effect.

Red Plague: Sting—injury; save Fort DC 15; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Con damage and 1d3 Int damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

Urhags are unnatural creatures that flop and _[[feats/Scuttle|scuttle]]_ through ancient ruins and barren canyon-lands. Originally native to the _[[spells/Nightmare|nightmare]]_ Plateau of Leng, they can slip into the waking world via an infected dreamer’s flesh.

Urhags crave the meat of sapient beings and enjoy infesting such hosts, even though urhags are barely capable of cohesive thought. Once an _urhag_’s victim dies, the _urhag_ wears it like armor for a time while slowly consuming its flesh. Strangely, urhags avoid eating creatures incapable of dreaming, as they find their taste repellent. An _urhag_ is about 4 feet long and weighs roughly 50 pounds.
