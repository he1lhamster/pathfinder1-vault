  Implant (Ex): Ground wasps grow their eggs inside of a living host. Implanting eggs
    in a host is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and the
    target must be helpless but alive. Once an egg is implanted, it exudes paralytic
    enzymes that not only keep the victim in a state of perpetual paralysis, but also
    keep it nourished and alive- and fully aware. This condition lasts until the egg
    hatches 1d6 days later, at which point the larvae consume most of the host, killing
    it. Any magical effect that removes paralysis or disease (such as remove paralysis,
    remove disease, or heal) destroys the eggs, but mere immunity to paralysis or
    disease does not offer protection.
  Poison (Ex): Sting-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect
    1d4 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: In areas of dense vegetation, ground wasps can destroy crops and ruin the
  land with their burrows, but in the rocky and sandy desert, living creatures are
  most at risk from these dangerous vermin. The blistering heat of the desert can
  damage delicate eggs laid in exposed locations, so ground wasps have evolved to
  lay their eggs safely in the bodies of their victims. They keep to their shallow
  burrows during the hottest parts of the day, but remain near the opening to ambush
  creatures that wander near. A fully-grown ground wasp is 2 feet long, with a wingspan
  of 5 feet, and weighs 22 pounds.

##### Description

In areas of dense vegetation, ground wasps can destroy crops and ruin the land with their burrows, but in the rocky and sandy desert, living creatures are most at risk from these dangerous vermin. The blistering _[[universal monster rules/Heat|heat]]_ of the desert can damage delicate eggs laid in exposed locations, so ground wasps have evolved to lay their eggs safely in the bodies of their victims. They keep to their shallow burrows during the hottest parts of the day, but remain near the opening to ambush creatures that wander near. A fully-grown ground wasp is 2 feet long, with a wingspan of 5 feet, and weighs 22 pounds.
