### Special Abilities

**Gale Breath (Su)** Every 1d4 rounds as a fullround

action, a _[[monsters/Ved|ved]]_ can draw in a mighty

breath and expel it outward in a 30-foot cone.

Targets within the first 10-foot segment of this

cone must succeed at a DC 18 Strength check or be

knocked _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_. Those who succeed at this check

and all other targets in the cone treat the effects

of the gale breath as a _[[spells/Gust Of Wind|gust of wind]]_ spell. The DC

is Constitution-based.

##### Description

Brutish and rather stupid, veds are clannish and

shun even lightly populated areas, preferring

cold hills and mountains. Occasionally, a gang of

veds (often an adult leading two or three

adolescents) carries out raids on remote

mining camps or other establishments

in the hills, claiming the lives of a half dozen

people or so and collecting whatever baubles,

food, and useful raw materials they

find. They rarely strike against larger

settlements, and don’t pursue sentient

creatures that f lee their attacks.

Clans of veds usually consist of a few mated pairs, their

offspring, and one or two aged specimens that are left to

die if they become unable to _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ their own weight. Veds

consider _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ their young a responsibility of every

adult member of the clan.

Veds enjoy simple sports that emphasize strength and

athleticism, particularly variations on tag or catch. The most

popular game veds play, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ simply “topple,” involves

stacking a pile of stones or logs and taking turns attempting

to blow it over. They make larger and larger stacks until one

of the competitors fails to blow it down. Even in sport, veds

are brutal, and tend to deliver a quick beating to the loser of

any game. They are pragmatic, however, and avoid injuries

that will _[[spells/Slow|slow]]_ the loser down.

Veds are omnivores; they prefer raw meat, but aren’t

averse to consuming tree bark for nourishment. Though

they have no compunctions about killing sentient

creatures, they rarely eat them. They simply leave the

bodies to rot or—for particularly sadistic or desperate

veds—use the corpses as bait for catching wild game.

Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the veds is their

enormous lung capacity, which they are able to use

aggressively. These giants can expel air from their lungs

in a mighty blast, extinguishing small fires and knocking

_prone_ any who stand before them. The veds then descend

on their victims, pummeling their prey viciously with

their simple but effective clubs.
