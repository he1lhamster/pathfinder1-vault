  Atavistic Fury (Ex): When a Liavaran dreamer is reduced to half of its total hit
    points or less, it angrily awakens from its normal somnambulant state. It gains
    a +2 bonus on attack rolls, melee damage rolls, and saving throws. In addition,
    its slam attack deals bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and its critical
    threat range becomes 18-20. While in this state of atavistic fury, a Liavaran
    dreamer cannot use its spell-like abilities. This state lasts for 1 minute, after
    which the dreamer is fatigued for 1 hour.
  Ley Line Dependency (Ex): A Liavaran dreamer takes 1 point of Wisdom damage for
    every day it spends more than a mile from a ley line. A dreamer whose Wisdom damage
    equals or exceeds its Wisdom score becomes permanently insane and enters a permanent
    state of atavistic fury.
  Lulling Thoughts (Su): The mind of a Liavaran dreamer echoes with the songs of a
    planet's ley lines, causing anyone who targets it with a thought-reading, mind
    control, or telepathic effect to become fascinated for 1d4+1 rounds (Will DC 17
    negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Sense Ley Line (Ex): A Liavaran dreamer can always sense the direction of and distance
    to the nearest ley line.
desc_long: According to the oral traditions of the jellyfish-like, spacefaring Brethedans
  (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 23), their kind sent a large convoy to colonize the gas
  giant Liavara ages ago. None of them ever returned or sent word of their success,
  and when a second flotilla of Brethedans set out to learn what had become of their
  kin, they found only the colonists' feral descendants. These “dreamers” had become
  intimately attuned to Liavara's dense network of ley lines, which lulled them into
  a persistent meditative trance. The few taken back to Bretheda, however, have proven
  that the dreamers can attune to any planet's ley lines. Anyone who attempts to make
  mental contact with them may find himself lulled into the same trance the dreamers
  experience. For the most part, the dreamers seem content merely to drift along the
  ley lines, but awakening them from the lines' peaceful melodies spurs most dreamers
  into violent furies. Brethedans as a whole have treated their cousins respectfully-almost
  reverently-granting them ample space in which to meander and feed.

##### Description

According to the oral traditions of the jellyfish-like, spacefaring Brethedans (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 23), their kind sent a large convoy to colonize the gas giant Liavara ages ago. None of them ever returned or sent word of their success, and when a second flotilla of Brethedans set out to learn what had become of their kin, they found only the colonists’ feral descendants. These “dreamers” had become intimately attuned to Liavara’s dense network of ley lines, which lulled them into a persistent meditative trance. The few taken back to Bretheda, however, have proven that the dreamers can attune to any planet’s ley lines. Anyone who attempts to make mental contact with them may find himself lulled into the same trance the dreamers experience. For the most part, the dreamers seem content merely to drift along the ley lines, but awakening them from the lines’ _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Peaceful|peaceful]]_ melodies spurs most dreamers into violent furies. Brethedans as a whole have treated their cousins respectfully—almost reverently—granting them ample space in which to meander and feed.
