  Energy Drain (Su): A succubus drains energy from a mortal she lures into an act
    of passion, such as a kiss. An unwilling victim must be grappled before the succubus
    can use this ability. The succubus's kiss bestows one negative level. The kiss
    also has the effect of a suggestion spell, asking the victim to accept another
    act of passion from the succubus. The victim must succeed on a DC 22 Will save
    to negate the suggestion. The DC is 22 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative
    level. These save DCs are Charisma-based.
  Profane Gift (Su): Once per day as a full-round action, a succubus may grant a profane
    gift to a willing humanoid creature by touching it for 1 full round. The target
    gains a +2 profane bonus to an ability score of his choice. A single creature
    may have no more than one profane gift from a succubus at a time. As long as the
    profane gift persists, the succubus can communicate telepathically with the target
    across any distance (and may use her suggestion spell-like ability through it).
    A profane gift is removed by dispel evil or dispel chaos. The succubus can remove
    it as well as a free action (causing 2d6 Charisma drain to the victim, no save).
desc_long: Among the demon hordes, a succubus can often rise to incredible heights
  of power through her manipulations and sensual charms, and many a demonic war has
  raged due to the subtle machinations of such creatures. A succubus is formed from
  the souls of particularly lustful and rapacious evil mortals.
