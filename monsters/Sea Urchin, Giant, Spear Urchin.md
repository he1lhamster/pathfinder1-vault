    Spear urchin venom causes horrific pain that weakens the muscles and causes intense nausea. The save DC is Constitution-based.

     Spines-injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str and nauseated for 1 round; cure 1 save.
  Spines (Ex): |-
    A spear urchin's spines can swivel and rotate to face any approaching creature that attacks it. Any creature that attacks a spear urchin with an unarmed strike or a natural attack, or any Large or smaller creature that attacks with a onehanded weapon or light weapon, is automatically attacked by the spear urchin's spines as an immediate action. If the spines hit, they can poison the target as well.

    In addition, a spear urchin can fire up to two spines each round as if they were javelins with a range increment of 30 feet. As long as its target is within range of its tremorsense (30 feet), a spear urchin ignores its Dexterity penalty on ranged attack rolls, but beyond this range the penalty functions normally, effectively increasing a spear urchin's penalty to hit by -4 over its standard penalty for range. A spear urchin's spines function equally well underwater as they do above water.
  Stability (Ex): |-
    All giant sea urchins receive a +8 bonus to CMD when resisting a bull rush or trip attempt.

    Much more dangerous than their smaller kin, giant sea urchins are dangerous predators of opportunity. With the exception of the hunter urchin, giant sea urchins lie in wait for food to come to them, typically carried within reach of their attacks via ocean currents or, more commonly, tides.
  Hunter Urchins: ': These urchins can adjust their spines to effect an awkward method
    of locomotion on land. They actively seek prey, and possess long, rasp-like tongues
    that can whip out and pull food to them.'
  Spear Urchins: ': These brightly colored creatures can fire spines like javelins,
    relying upon poison to slow down prey or eventually immobilize it so they can
    crawl over to feed.'
  Glass Urchins: ': So named for their transparency, these beautiful creatures shimmer
    like delicate crystals. Yet for all the damage their spines can inf lict, victims
    of glass urchins generally do more damage to themselves or their allies due to
    the potent hallucinatory effects of this urchin's venom.'

### Special Abilities

**_All-Around Vision_ (Ex)** All giant sea urchins can see in all directions. They gain a +4 racial bonus on Perception checks and cannot be flanked.

**Poison (Ex)** _[[poisons/Spear Urchin Venom|Spear urchin venom]]_ causes horrific pain that weakens the muscles and causes intense nausea. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Spines—injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str and _[[conditions/Nauseated|nauseated]]_ for 1 round; cure 1 save.
**Spines (Ex)** A _[[items/Weapon/Spear|spear]]_ urchin’s spines can swivel and rotate to face any approaching creature that attacks it. Any creature that attacks a _spear_ urchin with an unarmed strike or a natural attack, or any Large or smaller creature that attacks with a onehanded weapon or light weapon, is automatically attacked by the _spear_ urchin’s spines as an immediate action. If the spines hit, they can poison the target as well.

In addition, a _spear_ urchin can fire up to two spines each round as if they were javelins with a range increment of 30 feet. As long as its target is within range of its _tremorsense_ (30 feet), a _spear_ urchin ignores its Dexterity penalty on ranged attack rolls, but beyond this range the penalty functions normally, effectively increasing a _spear_ urchin’s penalty to hit by –4 over its standard penalty for range. A _spear_ urchin’s spines function equally well _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_ as they do above water.
**Stability (Ex)** All giant sea urchins receive a +8 bonus to CMD when resisting a bull rush or _trip_ attempt.

Much more dangerous than their smaller kin, giant sea urchins are dangerous predators of opportunity. With the exception of the _[[classes/Hunter|hunter]]_ urchin, giant sea urchins lie in wait for food to come to them, typically carried within reach of their attacks via ocean currents or, more commonly, tides.

**_Hunter_ Urchins**: These urchins can adjust their spines to effect an awkward method of locomotion on land. They actively seek prey, and possess long, rasp-like _[[spells/Tongues|tongues]]_ that can _[[items/Weapon/Whip|whip]]_ out and _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ food to them.
**_Spear_ Urchins**: These brightly colored creatures can fire spines like javelins, relying upon poison to _[[spells/Slow|slow]]_ down prey or eventually immobilize it so they can crawl over to feed.

**Glass Urchins**: So named for their transparency, these beautiful creatures shimmer like delicate crystals. Yet for all the damage their spines can inf lict, victims of glass urchins generally do more damage to themselves or their allies due to the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ hallucinatory effects of this urchin’s venom.
