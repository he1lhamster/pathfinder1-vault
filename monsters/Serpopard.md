  Dune Step (Su): Three times per day as part of a move action, a serpopard can instantaneously
    leap from one dune to any other dune within 1 mile as if by dimension door. The
    serpopard must begin and end this movement in an area of dunes. Using this ability
    does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
  Far Wanderer (Ex): Knowledge (geography) and Survival are class skills for serpopards.
  Limber Neck (Ex): A serpopard can use its long neck to make bite attacks as part
    of a rake attack against grappled opponents. In addition, a serpopard doesn't
    take the usual -2 penalty on attack rolls when it makes a bite attack while grappling.

  Avistani naturalists named this creature serpopard because they saw it as possessing features of both a leopard and a serpent, though this creature is also widely known by its Osiriani name sedja, meaning “one who travels from afar.” Serpopards earn this appellation because of their supernatural ability to leap from one dune to another, an ability they call “stepping between the dunes.”

  Some scholars speculate that the pharaohs of old bred this ability into the serpopards in order to create scouts and messengers able to cross the harsh terrain of their vast empires quickly and efficiently, but this creature is not one that has been created or influenced by humankind. Though rare, serpopards are naturally occurring beasts native to the deserts of northern Garund. Superstitious folk who believe that the gods' hands touch everything beneath the blistering Osirian sun see the serpopard as a cursed creature, marked with snakelike features by Apep and forced to wander eternally through the desert, never to find rest or sanctuary. On the other hand, carvings on ceremonial plates, on uncovered artifacts, and in ruined temples make it clear that the god-kings of Ancient Osirion once kept serpopards as pets or servants, as depictions of these creatures in the oldest of Osirion's ruins often show them chained or collared, bowing obediently to human masters.

  Serpopards stand approximately 3 feet tall at the shoulder; when their necks are fully extended, they can measure up to 20 feet long from nose to tail. Serpopards weigh anywhere from 150 to 200 lbs.

##### Description

Avistani naturalists named this creature _serpopard_ because they _[[items/Mundane/Saw|saw]]_ it as possessing features of both a leopard and a serpent, though this creature is also widely known by its Osiriani name sedja, meaning “one who travels from afar.” Serpopards earn this appellation because of their supernatural ability to leap from one dune to another, an ability they call “stepping between the dunes.”

Some scholars speculate that the pharaohs of old bred this ability into the serpopards in order to create scouts and messengers able to cross the harsh terrain of their vast empires quickly and efficiently, but this creature is not one that has been created or influenced by humankind. Though rare, serpopards are naturally occurring beasts native to the deserts of northern Garund. Superstitious folk who believe that the gods’ hands touch everything beneath the blistering Osirian sun see the _serpopard_ as a cursed creature, marked with snakelike features by Apep and forced to wander eternally through the desert, never to find rest or _[[spells/Sanctuary|sanctuary]]_. On the other hand, carvings on ceremonial plates, on uncovered artifacts, and in ruined temples make it clear that the god-kings of Ancient Osirion once kept serpopards as pets or servants, as depictions of these creatures in the oldest of Osirion’s ruins often show them chained or collared, bowing obediently to human masters.
