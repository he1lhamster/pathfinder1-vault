  Ferocious Rush (Ex): Once per day, a gurgist can push herself to act in a single,
    ferocious burst of energy. As a full-round action, the gurgist moves up to twice
    her speed and can make a single melee attack at the end of this movement. If the
    gurgist ends her movement adjacent to an enemy, that enemy is flat-footed against
    the gurgist until the beginning of the gurgist's next turn.
  Obsession Skill (Ex): 'Every gurgist has some hobby or activity or skill she uses
    to keep the hunger away, and which she swiftly masters. A gurgist selects one
    of the following skills: Appraise, Climb, Craft, Disable Device, Disguise, Handle
    Animal, Heal, Knowledge (any), Linguistics, Perform, Profession, Ride, Sleight
    of Hand, Spellcraft, Stealth, Survival, Swim, or Use Magic Device. That skill
    is a class skill for the gurgist. She gains Skill Focus and Signature Skill as
    bonus feats for this chosen skill, and she can reroll a failed check with her
    obsession skill once per day. This gurgist has chosen Craft (leatherworking) as
    her obsession skill.'
  Rotting Flesh (Su): Gurgists are forever slowly rotting, their flesh growing soft
    and discolored and eventually sloughing off in rancid slabs. The only way a gurgist
    can arrest this decay is to consume raw meat. A gurgist begins to rot if she goes
    more than 1 week without eating roughly 10% of her body weight in raw meat. After
    1 week, she takes 1 point of Constitution damage and 1 point of Charisma damage
    each day until she can feed. This damage cannot be healed until the gurgist has
    fed. A gentle repose spell extends the amount of time a gurgist can go without
    feeding for the duration of the spell.
desc_long: |-
  A gurgist mortic is a keen mind trapped within a rotting, hungering body. Gurgists can feel the decay of their flesh, just as they can feel the urgings of their gullet to rend and consume meat until they bloat with it. But unlike zombies and other carnivorous undead, mortics still have their wits about them and use their minds to find solutions to their nature. They hunt and herd to keep the rot at bay, they obsess over crafts or skills to distract from the hunger, and they wear extravagant masks and colorful garments to hide their hideousness.

   Gurgists are the same size as humans, averaging 5-1/2 to 6 feet tall, and weighing about 160 pounds.
