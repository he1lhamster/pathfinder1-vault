Thin tendrils trail from this misshapen ovoid. Its underside holds

a _[[monsters/Gray|gray]]_ orb that resembles a bulging, lidless eye.

### Special Abilities

**Pain Touch (Ex)** A _[[monsters/Rhu-chalik|rhu-chalik]]_ secretes an enzyme that

coats its tendrils. When this enzyme comes into

contact with a living creature, it causes excruciating

pain. Any creature that comes into contact with the

enzyme must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take a –2

penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and skill checks for 1d4

rounds. If a creature is affected by multiple pain touch attacks,

the duration stacks but the penalty doesn’t. This is a pain

effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Project Terror (Su)** As a standard action, a _rhu-chalik_ can harness

the fears of any creature on which it has successfully used

_detect thoughts_ within the last minute. This effect creates

terrible, nightmarish visions in the target’s mind; the target

must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_ and take

1d4 points of Wisdom damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Void Transmission (Su)** If a creature takes an amount of Wisdom

damage from the _rhu-chalik_’s project terror ability that equals

or exceeds the creature’s Wisdom score, the creature falls

_[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_ as normal. At that point, the _rhu-chalik_ can take 10

minutes to copy and absorb the creature’s entire consciousness

and send that consciousness through the void of space to its

waiting masters. If the creature’s Wisdom damage is healed

and the creature is revived prior to the end of this process, this

effect fails. If the creature’s Wisdom damage is healed after its

consciousness is successfully transmitted, the creature awakens

disoriented, and takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, ability

checks, and skill checks for 24 hours. This effect otherwise

doesn’t _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ the target, as the target’s consciousness isn’t

eliminated, only duplicated and transmitted.

##### Description

A _rhu-chalik_, also _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ a void wanderer, is an alien entity

that scouts through space on behalf of its conquering

masters. In addition, this aberration also collects the

memories of interesting creatures in the universe into

a vast repository of knowledge that their masters use to

slowly unravel all the secrets of existence.

Rhu-chaliks serve their masters tirelessly, and are

as patient as they are long-lived. They rarely make

an uncalculated move, and seek only the most prized

intellects to cast into the dark beyond for their masters’

delectations. When exploring distant worlds, rhu-chaliks

are not social beings, and they avoid other rhu-chaliks so

their predations won’t cause too much overlap in the mind

collections of their masters. However, back in their native

space, rhu-chaliks number in the billions, and

the creatures feed off a countless number of

disembodied minds.

A _rhu-chalik_ is approximately 3 feet

across and weighs only

30 pounds.
