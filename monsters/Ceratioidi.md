  Dual Mind (Ex): The fact that each ceratioidi is actually two creatures sharing
    the same body gives it a number of unique abilities. A ceratioidi can delegate
    various actions and physical processes to the individual minds, allowing it to
    fight with two weapons simultaneously without any penalties. It can also select
    two favored classes. The telepathic tangle between its twin consciousnesses makes
    a ceratioidi impervious to mind-affecting effects.
  Lure (Su): As a free action, a ceratioidi can light the dangling lure on its forehead,
    forcing all non-ceratioidi within a 20-foot radius to make a DC 15 Will save or
    become fascinated for 1 round. Regardless of the preceding interaction between
    the ceratioidi and its target, a creature affected by this ability does not view
    the ceratioidi who has fascinated it as a potential threat until that ceratioidi
    actually attacks-allowing it to approach without breaking the fascination. Once
    a creature successfully saves against this effect, it is immune to the same ceratioidi's
    lure ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Primitive Amphibian (Ex): Ceratioidi have rudimentary lungs capable of breathing
    air indefinitely, but their skin must be bathed in salt water regularly or it
    begins drying out painfully. They can go for a number of hours equal to twice
    their Constitution score (30 hours for most ceratioidi) before they need to be
    bathed in salt water-if they don't, they take 1 point of Constitution damage per
    hour. Any Constitution damage accrued is reversed after they spend at least 10
    minutes immersed in salt water.

### Special Abilities

**Dual Mind (Ex)** The fact that each _[[monsters/Ceratioidi|ceratioidi]]_ is actually two creatures sharing the same body gives it a number of unique abilities. A _ceratioidi_ can delegate various actions and physical processes to the individual minds, allowing it to fight with two weapons simultaneously without any penalties. It can also select two favored classes. The telepathic tangle between its twin consciousnesses makes a _ceratioidi_ _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Impervious|impervious]]_ to mind-affecting effects.

**Lure (Su)** As a free action, a _ceratioidi_ can light the dangling lure on its forehead, forcing all non-ceratioidi within a 20-foot radius to make a DC 15 Will save or become _[[conditions/Fascinated|fascinated]]_ for 1 round. Regardless of the preceding interaction between the _ceratioidi_ and its target, a creature affected by this ability does not view the _ceratioidi_ who has _fascinated_ it as a potential threat until that _ceratioidi_ actually attacks—allowing it to approach without _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Breaking|breaking]]_ the fascination. Once a creature successfully saves against this effect, it is immune to the same _ceratioidi_’s lure ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Primitive Amphibian (Ex)** _Ceratioidi_ have rudimentary lungs capable of breathing air indefinitely, but their skin must be bathed in salt water regularly or it begins drying out painfully. They can go for a number of hours equal to twice their Constitution score (30 hours for most _ceratioidi_) before they need to be bathed in salt water—if they don’t, they take 1 point of Constitution damage per hour. Any Constitution damage accrued is reversed after they spend at least 10 minutes immersed in salt water.

##### Description

Rulers of deep ocean trenches, _ceratioidi_ share several unusual traits with the aquatic predators of the ceratiidae family, also known as angler fish. From their strange, spired cities beneath the waves, _ceratioidi_ cast their nets of influence far and wide.

Perhaps the strangest aspect of the _ceratioidi_ is that each individual is in fact two entities—a powerful, imposing female, and a rat-sized parasitic male who spends most of his life attached to his mate’s neck. A female without a mate loses her dual mind ability, while a male unattached to a female retains his intelligence but otherwise has the same statistics as an electric eel (without the electricity special ability or electricity _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_).
