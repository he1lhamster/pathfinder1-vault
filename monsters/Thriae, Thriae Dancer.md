### Special Abilities

**Inspiring Dance (Su)** Three times per day as a

standard action, a thriae dancer can consume a

dose of merope and dance to create one of three effects. The

thriae dancer may maintain her dance as a free action, and

the effects persist as long as the thriae performs her dance.

A thriae dancer can dance for a number of rounds equal to

her Hit Dice before becoming _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_. After that, if she

continues _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Dancing|dancing]]_ for that same number of rounds,

she becomes _[[conditions/Exhausted|exhausted]]_. A thriae dancer may switch

between performances as a swift action. All dances

have a range of 60 feet. This is a mind-affecting effect.

Dance of Fervor: All non-thriae are affected by

_[[spells/Confusion|confusion]]_ and _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ (Will DC 17 negates). When this effect

ends, affected creatures are _fatigued_ for a number of rounds

equal to the time they were affected and are immune to

that thriae dancer’s dance of fervor effect for 24 hours. The

save DC is Charisma-based.

Dance of _[[spells/Grace|Grace]]_: All thriae gain a +1 insight bonus to AC and

on Reflex saves. This bonus increases to +2 if three or more

thriae dancers are performing a dance of _grace_ within range.

Dance of Passion: All thriae gain a +1 insight bonus on attack

and damage rolls. This bonus increases to +2 if three or more

thriae dancers are performing a dance of passion within range.

**Poison (Ex)** Sting—injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round

for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Str; cure 1 save.

##### Description

thriae dancers are among the most beautiful

of their kind. They are usually 6 feet tall and

weigh 180 pounds.

Only terpsichoreans, the most talented

and coveted thriae dancers, are permitted

to perform alone. Terpsichoreans

typically have levels in _[[classes/Bard|bard]]_, are at

least CR 9, and have access to the

following _spell-like abilities_.

3/day—_[[spells/Heroism|heroism]]_, _suggestion_
