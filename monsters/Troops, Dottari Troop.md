  Protect Ally (Ex): A dottari troop provides soft cover to any creature it recognizes
    as an ally who shares its space. Such protected allies treat squares occupied
    by the troop as difficult terrain and must succeed at a concentration check (DC
    = 15 + spell level) to cast spells while so protected, but do not take troop damage
    from being within the troop's space.
  Volley (Ex): A dottari troop can fire a volley of arrows as a standard action. This
    attack takes the form of up to four lines with a range of 100 feet. These lines
    can start from the corner of any square in the troop's space. All creatures in
    one of these lines take 4d6 points of piercing damage (Reflex DC 17 half). The
    save DC is Dexterity-based, and includes the bonus from the dottari troop's Ability
    Focus feat.
desc_long: House Thrune and the Church of Asmodeus can mobilize special groups of
  dottari and inquisitors known as troops. Typically, a troop is placed under the
  command of a captain or priest who does not function as part of the troop.
