Eager to rejoin her sisters, Yrldak might seek the aid of adventurers, to whom she may promise wealth, prophecy, and other boons if they assist her in her quest.

##### Description

The _norn_ known as _Yrldak_ and her sisters Surlda and
Hilde have served as handmaidens for Magdh, prophetess
and seer of the mysterious Eldest who have ruled the
First World since the gods were young. Serving as their
mistress’s agents, these norns protect her long-term
interests wherever possible, but especially on
the Material Plane, where Magdh lacks direct
influence. As one of the multiverse’s most
prescient beings, Magdh is capable of
seeing farther down the long lines of
probability and fate than the norns
themselves, and the triumvirate often
takes on dangerous and enigmatic
missions on Magdh’s behalf.

It was on one such venture that _Yrldak_
met her demise upon the Material
Plane, when facing a particularly
greedy white dragon who thought
the _norn_ trio’s treasure would make
a good addition to its hoard. As
happens to all norns who die
outside the First World, _Yrldak_
was reborn on her native plane,
and is quickly _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Growing|growing]]_ while
traversing Golarion looking for her
sisters. Exhibiting the dark features of
a reborn _norn_, whose hair and eyes lighten
as they age, _Yrldak_ is distinctive among her
kind, and though her ebon hair reveals her
still undeveloped power, _Yrldak_ is a force
to be reckoned with if any stand in her
way or tempt fate in her presence. Eager
to rejoin her sisters, _Yrldak_ might seek
the aid of adventurers, to whom she may
promise wealth, prophecy, and other
boons if they assist her in her quest.
