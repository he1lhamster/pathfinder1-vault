  Freeze (Ex): A scythe glass swarm can assemble itself into a large, stained-glass

  Resonant Flight (Su): The wings of a scythe glass swarm produces a resonant sound,
    creating a hypnotic effect to all who hear it. Every creature within 60 feet of
    a scythe glass swarm must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become fascinated for
    2d4 rounds. While the target is fascinated, the scythe glass swarm can approach
    the target without breaking the effect, but an attack from the scythe glass swarm
    immediately ends the effect. Creatures that successfully save against this effect
    can't be affected by the same scythe glass swarm's resonant flight ability for
    24 hours. This is a sonic, mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

  Serrated Wings (Ex): A scythe glass swarm's serrated wings leave severe, bleeding
    cuts on its victims. Its swarm attack deals an additional 2d6 points of bleed
    damage.

  Many would-be thieves have found themselves spellbound by the sound of a beautiful, stained glass window breaking apart and taking flight. This is followed by their screams of terror as thousands of tiny wings cut them to shreds. Scythe glass swarms are used to safeguard shrines and inner sanctums from unwanted attention while also providing beautiful facades when the creatures are inactive. Different religions and sects add their own twists on the constructs to express some aspect of their gods or masters. A scythe glass swarm remains within the confines of the area it is guarding, but even if intruders manage to escape, the blood from pouring from their wounds can be used to track down the interlopers.

  Scythe glass swarms consist of thousands of winged glass insects. An individual insect is 9 inches in height and weighs under a pound.

This is followed by their screams of terror as thousands of tiny wings cut them to shreds. _[[items/Weapon/Scythe|Scythe]]_ glass swarms are used to safeguard shrines and inner sanctums from unwanted attention while also providing beautiful facades when the creatures are inactive. Different religions and sects add their own twists on the constructs to express some aspect of their gods or masters. A _scythe glass swarm_ remains within the confines of the area it is _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Guarding|guarding]]_, but even if intruders manage to escape, the blood from pouring from their wounds can be used to track down the interlopers.

_Scythe_ glass swarms consist of thousands of winged glass insects. An individual insect is 9 inches in height and weighs under a pound.
