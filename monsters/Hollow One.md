  Dread (Su): As a standard action, a hollow one can cause all creatures within 30
    feet to become shaken for 1 minute. On a successful DC 19 Will save, affected
    creatures are instead shaken for 1 round. This effect doesn't cause a shaken creature
    to become frightened or a frightened creature to become panicked. This is a mind-affecting
    fear effect and the save DC is Charisma-based.
  Rage (Su): As a free action after taking damage in combat, a hollow one can fly
    into a rage. While raging, the hollow one gains a +2 bonus to Strength and 30
    temporary hit points, but takes a -2 penalty to AC. The rage lasts until the end
    of the battle or for 1 minute, whichever is shorter. A hollow one can voluntarily
    end this rage at any point.

  Hollow ones are complex creations designed to fulfill a variety of purposes, most often acting as servants, guardians, or assistants. Each hollow one is bound by a physical similarity to a certain humanoid, who sacrifices a portion of himself in the formation process.

  Unlike many constructs, however, the hollow one has a spark of intelligent life-the essence of its creator or the creator's victim. While this enlivening energy is little more than a shallow imitation of the original's true being, sometimes the hollow one can become more than an automaton and seek out its own life and motivations. These hollow ones are the most dangerous because they are most prone to madness (especially violent madness). Such a hollow one is the exception to the rule, however, and most are destined to become little more than slaves and playthings, obedient mockeries of those they were created to look like.

  When encountered, hollow ones are often mistaken for undead creatures instead of constructs, mainly due to the unconventional building material required to create these creatures.

  A hollow one is the same size as the humanoid it was fashion to resemble, but weighs a mere fraction of his weight due to being only chemically treated skin.

##### Description

Hollow ones are complex creations designed to fulfill a variety of purposes, most often acting as servants, guardians, or assistants. Each _hollow one_ is bound by a physical similarity to a certain humanoid, who sacrifices a portion of himself in the formation process.

Unlike many constructs, however, the _hollow one_ has a _[[spells/Spark|spark]]_ of intelligent life—the essence of its creator or the creator’s victim. While this enlivening energy is little more than a shallow imitation of the original’s true being, sometimes the _hollow one_ can become more than an automaton and seek out its own life and motivations. These hollow ones are the most dangerous because they are most _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ to madness (especially violent madness). Such a _hollow one_ is the exception to the rule, however, and most are destined to become little more than slaves and playthings, obedient mockeries of those they were created to look like.

When encountered, hollow ones are often mistaken for undead creatures instead of constructs, mainly due to the unconventional building material required to create these creatures.

A _hollow one_ is the same size as the humanoid it was fashion to resemble, but weighs a mere fraction of his weight due to being only chemically treated skin.
