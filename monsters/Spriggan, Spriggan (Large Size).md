  Size Alteration (Su): At will as a standard action, a spriggan can change his size
    between Small and Large. Weapons, armor, and other objects on the spriggan's person
    grow proportionally when he changes size (objects revert to normal size 1 round
    after a spriggan releases them). When a spriggan becomes Large, his speed increases
    to 30 feet, he gains +12 Strength, -2 Dexterity, and +6 Constitution, and he takes
    a -2 size penalty to his AC. While Large, a spriggan cannot use his sneak attack
    or his racial spell-like abilities (although if he possesses either from class
    levels or templates, he retains their use in both sizes).
  Spriggan Magic (Ex): A spriggan gains a +1 racial bonus on concentration checks
    and to save DCs for all of its racial spell-like abilities.
  Spriggan Skills (Ex): |-
    Climb, Disable Device, Perception, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth are class skills for spriggans.

    When the gnomes first traveled to the mortal realm from the distant land of the fey, some found the Material Plane so strange and terrifying that they lost their sense of joy. Seeing only the threats of the new world but none of its wonders, they grimly resolved to survive no matter the cost. Their innate magic responded to this twisted goal by reshaping them in mind and body over the course of many generations, transforming them into the creatures known as spriggans. Love, happiness, and beauty have no meaning for these poor souls, so they lead lives of violence and malice. The best they can manage in place of positive emotions is a muted satisfaction when they make another suffer.

    Spriggans resemble ugly gnomes with an alien, feral appearance. Many are gaunt and haggard. When magically enlarged, they look the same except much more hale and muscular.
