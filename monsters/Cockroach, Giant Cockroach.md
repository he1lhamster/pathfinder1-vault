  Much like their smaller kin, giant cockroaches are extremely adaptive and exist in any place they can find a ready source of food. Giant cockroaches are not normally very violent, but readily attack if threatened or if food becomes scarce. 

  A number of species of giant cockroach exist, as summarized on the table above. Most of these variants have additional abilities, such as poison stings.
