  Ambush Strike (Ex): During the surprise round, the scrapshell can use its razor-sharp
    tongue to gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls, threaten a critical hit on a natural
    roll of 15-20, and automatically confirm any critical hit against a flat-footed
    creature.
  Sticky Shell (Ex): A scrapshell exudes a sticky mucus that causes items that come
    into contact with its shell to become affixed. The items stuck to a scrapshell
    grant it a +4 armor bonus to AC. A weapon that strikes a scrapshell becomes stuck
    fast unless the wielder succeeds at a DC 17 Reflex save. A creature adjacent to
    the scrapshell can pry off a stuck weapon with a successful DC 17 Strength check,
    but doing so provokes attacks of opportunity. A creature that becomes stuck to
    a scrapshell via a natural attack gains the grappled condition, but the scrapshell
    does not. A successful critical hit on a scrapshell not only avoids this defensive
    mechanism (and thus the attacker has no chance of becoming stuck to the shell)
    but also bypasses its damage reduction. If a scrapshell takes more than 10 points
    of damage from a single fire attack, its sticky mucus is burned away. A dose of
    universal solvent or similar fluid automatically removes a scrapshell's sticky
    shell ability. It takes a scrapshell 24 hours to secrete more sticky mucus, and
    during this time, it does not gain the advantages of this ability, and it loses
    its armor bonus to AC. The shell loses its sticky quality 1 hour after the scrapshell
    dies. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Tongue (Ex): A scrapshell attacks with a thin, elongated tongue tipped with a long,
    curved blade of shell, similar in size to a large falchion. This is a primary
    attack.
desc_long: Fiercely territorial, the scrapshell is commonly found in the waters around
  the Eye of Abendego and the trade routes of the Inner Sea, as well as other areas
  laced with sunken ships or underwater ruins. The scrapshell's penchant for lairing
  in or near submerged shipwrecks and other coastal detritus and for adorning its
  shell with interesting (and often highly valuable) debris makes it a tempting target
  for scavengers of all sorts. Any treasure found in or near a scrapshell generally
  consists of weapons stuck to its shell or the large and uniquely colored pearls
  the creature produces-these dazzling and iridescent pearls are highly prized. Scrapshell
  mucus loses its sticky quality soon after the creature's death. A scrapshell measures
  about 10 feet across and weighs 800 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**Ambush Strike (Ex)** During the surprise round, the _[[monsters/Scrapshell|scrapshell]]_ can use its razor-sharp tongue to gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls, threaten a critical hit on a natural roll of 15–20, and automatically confirm any critical hit against a _flat-footed_ creature.
**_Sticky_ Shell (Ex)** A _scrapshell_ exudes a _sticky_ mucus that causes items that come into contact with its shell to become affixed. The items stuck to a _scrapshell_ grant it a +4 armor bonus to AC. A weapon that strikes a _scrapshell_ becomes stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds at a DC 17 Reflex save. A creature adjacent to the _scrapshell_ can pry off a stuck weapon with a successful DC 17 Strength check, but doing so provokes attacks of opportunity. A creature that becomes stuck to a _scrapshell_ via a natural attack gains the _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ condition, but the _scrapshell_ does not. A successful critical hit on a _scrapshell_ not only avoids this defensive mechanism (and thus the attacker has no chance of becoming stuck to the shell) but also bypasses its _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_. If a _scrapshell_ takes more than 10 points of damage from a single fire attack, its _sticky_ mucus is burned away. A dose of _[[items/Wondrous Item/Universal Solvent|universal solvent]]_ or similar fluid automatically removes a _scrapshell_’s _sticky_ shell ability. It takes a _scrapshell_ 24 hours to secrete more _sticky_ mucus, and during this time, it does not gain the advantages of this ability, and it loses its armor bonus to AC. The shell loses its _sticky_ quality 1 hour after the _scrapshell_ dies. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Tongue (Ex)** A _scrapshell_ attacks with a thin, elongated tongue tipped with a long, curved blade of shell, similar in size to a large _[[items/Weapon/Falchion|falchion]]_. This is a primary attack.

##### Description

Fiercely territorial, the _scrapshell_ is commonly found in the waters around the Eye of Abendego and the trade routes of the Inner Sea, as well as other areas laced with sunken ships or _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_ ruins. The _scrapshell_’s penchant for lairing in or near submerged shipwrecks and other coastal detritus and for adorning its shell with interesting (and often highly valuable) debris makes it a tempting target for scavengers of all sorts. Any treasure found in or near a _scrapshell_ generally consists of weapons stuck to its shell or the large and uniquely colored pearls the creature produces—these dazzling and iridescent pearls are highly prized. _Scrapshell_ mucus loses its _sticky_ quality soon after the creature’s death. A _scrapshell_ measures about 10 feet across and weighs 800 pounds.
