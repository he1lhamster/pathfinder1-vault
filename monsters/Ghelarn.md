special_abilities:
  Carapace (Ex): A ghelarn typically shelters within a hardened, rocklike shell that
    houses all of its vital organs. By withdrawing its tentacles and sensory stalks
    into its shell, the ghelarn gains total cover until the beginning of its next
    turn. The shell doesn't provide cover against targeted spells, and the ghelarn's
    movement is limited to downward burrowing during this time. The benefits of the
    shell can be lost if sundered (hardness 5, 8 hit points, regenerates in 2d6 days),
    and a ghelarn caught without its carapace loses its natural armor bonus.
  Entrap (Ex): A ghelarn secretes a quagmire of sticky fluid a few feet below the
    sand where it lives. This fluid extends in a 10-foot radius around the creature
    and acts to trap victims, making it easier for the ghelarn to attack prey with
    its tentacles or feed upon it with its leeching tendrils. This otherwise acts
    as the entrap universal monster rule.
  Hibernate (Ex): When food is scarce, a ghelarn can enter a state of hibernation
    for an indefinite period of time. When it enters hibernation, the ghelarn nestles
    itself in the sand and fills in its porous carapace with sticky excretions that
    quickly harden to seal the creature from the elements. When hibernating, the ghelarn
    doesn't have to eat or drink. A ghelarn remains in a state of hibernation until
    it senses another living creature within 10 feet, at which point it dissolves
    the seals on its carapace over the course of 1d4 minutes.
  Leeching Tendrils (Ex): A living creature that spends more than a single round ensnared
    within a ghelarn's entrapping fluid becomes targeted by invasive tendrils from
    the ghelarn's lower body. These feeding stalks deal 1 point of bleed damage each
    round, and continue to do so for as long as a victim remains within the area of
    the ghelarn's entrapping fluid.
desc_long: |-
  Born on the desert plain of an alien world, the softbodied ghelarn is a non-aquatic arthropod living within a shell-like exoskeleton manufactured from its own hardened secretions. This outer carapace contains many perforations, similar to dry coral or air-blasted stone, providing ample room from which the ghelarn can extend its outer extremities and explore the world. Chief among these appendages are two main tentacles that it uses to pull itself through the upper layers of sand within its native home, burrowing just below the surface while its hardened carapace remains above ground. As a result, ghelarns give the impression of ambulatory stone formations when traveling, but they can also abandon their shells entirely and delve deeper into the sand to avoid predators.

  Patient, quiet creatures, ghelarns prefer to ambush prey, waiting until suitable meals wander within reach of their tentacles or into the sticky quagmires they create just below the surface around their nesting grounds. Helpless victims soon find themselves pulled into the sand as the ghelarn extends invasive tendrils from its lower body. These lesser tentacles slowly bleed away moisture from anyone trapped in the ooze, leaving behind little more than dried husks and bones for scavengers to find, along with whatever equipment such victims may have carried.

The shell doesn’t provide cover against targeted spells, and the _ghelarn_’s movement is limited to downward burrowing during this time. The benefits of the shell can be lost if sundered (hardness 5, 8 hit points, regenerates in 2d6 days), and a _ghelarn_ caught without its carapace loses its natural armor bonus.

##### Description

Born on the desert plain of an alien world, the softbodied _ghelarn_ is a non-aquatic arthropod living within a shell-like exoskeleton manufactured from its own hardened secretions. This outer carapace contains many perforations, similar to dry coral or air-blasted stone, providing ample room from which the _ghelarn_ can extend its outer extremities and explore the world. Chief among these appendages are two main tentacles that it uses to _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ itself through the upper layers of sand within its native home, burrowing just below the surface while its hardened carapace remains above ground. As a result, ghelarns give the impression of ambulatory stone formations when traveling, but they can also abandon their shells entirely and delve deeper into the sand to avoid predators.

Patient, quiet creatures, ghelarns prefer to ambush prey, waiting until suitable meals wander within reach of their tentacles or into the _sticky_ quagmires they create just below the surface around their nesting grounds. _[[conditions/Helpless|Helpless]]_ victims soon find themselves pulled into the sand as the _ghelarn_ extends invasive tendrils from its lower body. These lesser tentacles slowly _bleed_ away moisture from anyone trapped in the ooze, leaving behind little more than dried husks and bones for scavengers to find, along with whatever equipment such victims may have carried.
