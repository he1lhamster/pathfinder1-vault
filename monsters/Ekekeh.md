  Bioelectric Shield (Ex): At will, an ekekeh can activate an electrical field generated
    by its body as a swift action. While the bioelectric shield is active, any creature
    attacking the ekekeh with a melee or natural weapon takes 3d6 points of electricity
    damage (Reflex DC 15 half). This ability can remain active indefinitely, but most
    ekekehs employ it only when they feel endangered; deactivating the field is a
    free action. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Telekinetic Levitation (Su): An ekekeh has the ability to float in the air, moving
    itself along with pure thought. This functions as air walk, but the ekekeh can
    move at only a quarter of its swim speed (normally 20 feet), and can never rise
    more than 10 feet above the ground or a structure capable of supporting its weight.
    It cannot climb vertical surfaces or float over water.

  Ekekehs are intelligent aquatic creatures similar to dolphins, with a row of horns that runs down their backs. Filled with organic metal deposits, these horns both sense the electrical fields of living creatures and channel the ekekehs' own energy into devastating attacks. Contemplative and fun-loving, ekekehs hold themselves up as proof that humanoids don't have a monopoly on civilization. While at home in the open ocean, ekekehs also build grand underwater cities, working magic and employing tools via the same limited telekinetic abilities that allow them to float over dry land, where their gills process air as well as water. The slow speed and limited maneuverability of this flight strikes most ekekehs as terribly boring, if not downright embarrassing, yet it is still common for residents of coastal cities to see ekekehs floating slowly through the marketplace, their belongings stuffed into specially fitted packs or dangling from broad leather utility belts. 

  An average ekekeh is 10 feet long and weighs 1,000 pounds.

While the bioelectric _shield_ is active, any creature attacking the _ekekeh_ with a melee or natural weapon takes 3d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 15 half). This ability can remain active indefinitely, but most ekekehs employ it only when they feel endangered; deactivating the field is a free action. The save DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

Ekekehs are intelligent aquatic creatures similar to dolphins, with a row of horns that runs down their backs. Filled with organic metal deposits, these horns both sense the electrical fields of living creatures and channel the ekekehs’ own energy into devastating attacks. _[[monsters/Contemplative|Contemplative]]_ and fun-loving, ekekehs hold themselves up as proof that humanoids don’t have a monopoly on civilization. While at home in the open ocean, ekekehs also build grand _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_ cities, working magic and employing tools via the same limited telekinetic abilities that allow them to float over dry land, where their gills process air as well as water. The _[[spells/Slow|slow]]_ speed and limited maneuverability of this _[[universal monster rules/Flight|flight]]_ strikes most ekekehs as terribly boring, if not downright embarrassing, yet it is still common for residents of coastal cities to see ekekehs floating slowly through the marketplace, their belongings stuffed into specially fitted packs or dangling from broad leather utility belts.

An average _ekekeh_ is 10 feet long and weighs 1,000 pounds.
