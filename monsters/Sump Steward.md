##### Description

Hidden away in deep caverns or under the shade of

mangroves in isolated swamps, sump stewards hum

songs while they dutifully tend to verdant colonies of

mushrooms and fungi. Vaguely humanoid in form, sump

stewards carry old tree trunks, rotting logs, or other large

tools to help them tend and protect these colonies while

they make their rounds. As they work, they sing low,

thrumming tunes that _[[spells/Echo|echo]]_ throughout their domain.

Sump stewards—who, despite their intelligence, have no

name for themselves and only indifferently acknowledge

the names given by other races—have long, spindly limbs

that possess great strength. Their form consists of mosses

and lichens, with vines wrapping their bodies and holding

them together. Mushrooms sprout all over the sump

steward’s form, although two red mushrooms glow where

eyes would be. Some sump stewards grow long beards

made of interwoven moss or grass.

A _sump steward_ stands almost 15 feet tall, though they

are frequently hunched over and seem shorter. They

weigh approximately 1,400 pounds.
