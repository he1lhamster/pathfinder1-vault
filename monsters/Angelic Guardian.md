  Deflective Wings (Ex): As a standard action, an angelic guardian can spread its
    wings and protect a single adjacent creature from the next ranged attack. The
    next time the protected creature would normally be hit with an attack from a ranged
    attack, the attack is instead deflected and the protected creature takes no damage.
    An angelic guardian can only deflect one ranged attack per turn in this way. This
    effect lasts until the angelic guardian's next turn or until the protected creature
    leaves its square, whichever comes first.
  Metallic Feathers (Ex): An angelic guardian's wings are honed to razor-sharp edges,
    and attacks with them deal slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage.
desc_long: |-
  Those toiling in the Golemworks of Magnimar provide myriad goods to their buyers, but perhaps none are so popular as the highly sought-after angelic guardian. Nobles, entrepreneurs, and wealthy paranoiacs alike purchase angelic guardians to serve as their personal protectors. Though inspired by Varisian depictions of angelic beings, these metallic beings are not truly from another plane, but are instead merely stylized automatons designed to watch over and protect their masters. They can be found throughout much of the Summit, where they line aristocrats' gardens and stand stoically for days or even weeks without moving, their burning halos the only feature suggestive of animation.

  Angelic guardians can be forged from various substances, though their bodies are typically made from brass and their wings from steel. Angelic guardians stand nearly 7 feet tall and weigh 2,000 pounds.

##### Description

Those toiling in the Golemworks of Magnimar provide myriad goods to their buyers, but perhaps none are so popular as the highly sought-after _angelic guardian_. Nobles, entrepreneurs, and wealthy paranoiacs alike purchase angelic guardians to serve as their personal protectors. Though _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Inspired|inspired]]_ by Varisian depictions of angelic beings, these metallic beings are not truly from another plane, but are instead merely stylized automatons designed to watch over and protect their masters. They can be found throughout much of the Summit, where they line aristocrats’ gardens and stand stoically for days or even weeks without moving, their _burning_ halos the only feature suggestive of animation.

Angelic guardians can be forged from various substances, though their bodies are typically made from brass and their wings from steel. Angelic guardians stand nearly 7 feet tall and weigh 2,000 pounds.
