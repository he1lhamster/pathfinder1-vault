special_abilities:
  Frustrating Touch (Su): A soulpierced's touch transfers some of its overwhelming
    frustration to its target. A creature damaged by a soulpierced's incorporeal touch
    attack must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round. This
    is an emotion and mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Wisdom-based.
  Livid Outburst (Su): Three times per day as a standard action, the soulpierced can
    release a burst of deepseated rage to overwhelm the emotions of surrounding creatures.
    All creatures within 30 feet of the soulpierced take 20d6 points of damage and
    become livid with anger. Livid creatures take a -2 penalty to AC and can't cast
    spells, use Charisma- or Intelligence-based skills other than Intimidate, or use
    any ability that requires patience or concentration. A successful DC 25 Will save
    halves the damage and negates the livid effect. A livid creature can attempt a
    new save at the end of each of its turn to end the livid effect, but it is fatigued
    for 1 round after the livid effect ends. This is an emotion and mind-affecting
    effect. The save DC is Wisdom-based.
  Rejuvenation (Su): A soulpierced can be permanently destroyed only if the blade
    is first removed from its heart. Otherwise, A soulpierced that is destroyed reappears
    in the same location 2d4 days later.
  Site Bound (Ex): A soulpierced cannot travel more than 100 feet from where it was
    created.
  Soulpiercing Blade (Su): A soulpierced's spirit is anchored in place by the blade
    through its heart. While this blade is in place, the soulpierced cannot be restored
    to life by any means other than direct intervention of a deity. This blade is
    also the source of the soulpierced's rejuvenation ability. Although a soulpierced
    is incorporeal, a corporeal creature can remove the blade as though it had the
    ghost touch magic weapon special ability. Removing the blade requires a successful
    disarm or steal combat maneuver made as a full-round action. As a free action,
    a creature removing the blade must succeed at a DC 35 Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge
    (religion) check to recite an appropriate prayer; otherwise, the blade isn't removed,
    even if the combat maneuver was successful. The blade disintegrates once removed,
    and the creature that removed it must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save or incur
    2d4 negative levels. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  A soulpierced is created from the tormented spirit of a victim of ritualistic murder. Each soulpierced is bound to the site of its death by a magical blade thrust through its chest. Even as a spirit, the soulpierced's still-beating heart is gruesomely visible, as is the blade stabbed through it. Although a soulpierced resembles a ghostly version of its living form, its features are so twisted by rage and grief that it is difficult to recognize. Prevented from moving on and receiving Pharasma's judgment but also unable to be returned to life, these tormented creatures grow increasingly bitter and angry, magically inflicting its frustration and rage onto nearby creatures.

   Even those who destroy a soulpierced find their work incomplete, as the blade through the creature's heart causes it to rejuvenate in the same location within days. Only by removing the soulpiercing blade can anyone free the creature and permanently eliminate it as a threat. But the attempt itself poses grave danger, as close proximity to the soulpierced exposes the opponent to the creature's wrathful attack and the blade itself can harm those who remove it.

##### Description

A _soulpierced_ is created from the tormented spirit of a victim of ritualistic murder. Each _soulpierced_ is bound to the site of its death by a magical blade thrust through its chest. Even as a spirit, the _soulpierced_’s still-beating heart is gruesomely visible, as is the blade stabbed through it.

Only by removing the soulpiercing blade can anyone free the creature and permanently eliminate it as a threat. But the attempt itself poses grave danger, as close proximity to the _soulpierced_ exposes the opponent to the creature’s wrathful attack and the blade itself can _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ those who remove it.
