  Curse of Stone (Su): Curse-touch; save Fort DC 17; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day;
    effect 1d6 Dex. A creature afflicted by the curse of stone slowly turns to stone,
    its skin turning an ashen gray and hardening into a stony texture. For every 3
    points of Dexterity damage taken, the victim gains a +1 natural armor bonus. The
    curse of stone can only be cured by removing the curse followed by a stone to
    flesh spell to undo the damage it has done. If the curse is not removed first,
    stone to flesh only restores 1d3 points of Dexterity, though these can be lost
    again as the curse continues to spread. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Petrified Body (Ex): The stony flesh of a petrified maiden reacts to certain spells
    and effects as noted below. A transmute rock to mud spell deals 1d6 points of
    damage per caster level to a petrified maiden, with no saving throw.Transmute
    mud to rock immediately heals any and all damage taken by a petrified maiden.A
    stone to flesh spell does not actually change the petrified maiden's structure,
    but negates its damage reduction and spell resistance for 1 round.
  Reconstitution (Su): As long as Geb's original curse that first afflicted the petrified
    maidens remains unbroken, any petrified maiden (animate or not) that is damaged
    or destroyed slowly returns to its undamaged form, even if parts of it were utterly
    destroyed or carried away. For a relatively undamaged petrified maiden, this slow
    process can be completed in a week or so. For a petrified maiden reduced to rubble,
    it might take years. If a petrified maiden is destroyed while under the effects
    of a stone to flesh spell, it cannot reconstitute and is permanently destroyed.
  Weapon Expertise (Ex): A petrified maiden is proficient with any one martial weapon.
    It gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with this weapon.
desc_long: |-
  Petrified maidens are the remains of the army of warrior women led by the pirate queen Mastrien Slash in her failed invasion of southern Geb. The wizard king Geb himself cursed the warriors, turning them to stone and creating what is now known as the Field of Maidens. While a petrified maiden appears at first glance to be a construct, it has in fact been animated by the restless undead spirit of the warrior maiden it once was. The nature of Geb's curse remains mysterious even today-it is simply known that occasionally the spirits of the slain inhabit their stony corpses and lurch to vengeful unlife. When this occurs, the maiden's stone weapon changes to steel (though it remains fused within the maiden's grasp). The weapon can be recovered when the maiden is destroyed.

  Connected to one another by some unknown force-perhaps a side effect of Geb's curse-those petrified maidens whose remains have been removed from the Field of Maidens do everything in their power to rejoin their sisters.

##### Description

_Petrified_ maidens are the remains of the army of warrior women led by the _[[npcs/Pirate Queen|pirate queen]]_ Mastrien Slash in her failed invasion of southern Geb. The _[[classes/Wizard|wizard]]_ _[[npcs/King|king]]_ Geb himself cursed the warriors, turning them to stone and creating what is now known as the Field of Maidens. While a _petrified maiden_ appears at first glance to be a construct, it has in fact been _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Animated|animated]]_ by the restless undead spirit of the warrior maiden it once was. The nature of Geb’s curse remains mysterious even today—it is simply known that occasionally the spirits of the slain inhabit their stony corpses and lurch to vengeful unlife. When this occurs, the maiden’s stone weapon changes to steel (though it remains fused within the maiden’s _[[spells/Grasp|grasp]]_). The weapon can be recovered when the maiden is destroyed.

Connected to one another by some _[[monsters/Unknown|unknown]]_ force—perhaps a side effect of Geb’s curse—those _petrified_ maidens whose remains have been removed from the Field of Maidens do everything in their power to rejoin their sisters.
