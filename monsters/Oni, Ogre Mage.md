##### Description

The _[[monsters/Ogre|ogre]]_ mage, like all oni, is an evil spirit come to the Material Plane and clad in living flesh—in this case, that of a brutish _ogre_. _Ogre_ mages are often found serving as leaders of _ogre_ tribes, yet not all of them seek to link their destinies to their less-intelligent kin. Some become lone marauders who hold villages hostage, demanding regular tribute in the form of gold, food, or maidens, lest they take more than they ask.
