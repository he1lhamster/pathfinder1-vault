  Collapse (Ex): An atuikakura can collapse the collagen that forms its body wall
    as an immediate action, essentially liquefying itself. If it does so, it ignores
    its size penalty on Stealth checks (-12 for a typical atuikakura) and gains the
    amorphous and compression abilities, and immunity to bludgeoning attacks. While
    collapsed, an atuikakura cannot use its natural attacks-often, an atuikakura will
    collapse after swallowing a victim whole so it can digest its meal. A collapsed
    atuikakura can reconstitute its body wall as a free action at the beginning of
    its turn.
  Poison (Su): Bite, slam, or tentacles-injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round
    for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Con and assaulted by visions of the past and blinded
    for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves. The blindness side effect is a mind affecting
    effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Self-Evisceration (Ex): When an atuikakura takes damage, it can reflexively expel
    extraneous respiratory organs from its body as an immediate action, poisoning
    and entangling a nearby foe. A creature up to 20 feet away (or up to 10 feet away
    if the atuikakura or the other creature is not underwater) becomes entangled for
    1d4 rounds (Reflex DC 25 negates). Whether or not it becomes entangled, the creature
    is also exposed to the atuikakura's poison unless it has the evasion ability.
    The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Spiny Slam (Ex): An atuikakura's slam attack deals bludgeoning and piercing damage.
  Tentacle Grip (Ex): An atuikakura that grabs a Large or smaller creature with its
    tentacles does not gain the grappled condition, can maintain its grapple as a
    free action (though if it does, it can't attempt any additional checks to maintain
    the grapple that round), and can move itself and its target at full speed without
    attempting additional grapple checks
desc_long: Atuikakuras are typically content to dwell placidly at the bottom of deep
  bays or oceans. They are easily startled by large objects and creatures, and enjoy
  entwining themselves around driftwood and other solid objects and resting there
  beneath the waterline, which can lead to rare attacks on ships or other surface
  dwellers.
