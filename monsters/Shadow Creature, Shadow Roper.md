Stranger still, a burgeoning ecology of shadow creatures that forms a colony on the Material Plane seems to create a small blighted realm of shadow where they dwell.

##### Description

When a Material Plane creature is trapped on or chooses to remain on the _Shadow_ Plane, it often finds that its offspring take on some of the eerie qualities of its new home dimension. Those who are born in that place become _[[spells/Weird|weird]]_ mockeries of their kin on the Material Plane.

Their colorings become jet-black (or at best a hazy _[[monsters/Gray|gray]]_), their features become more _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Menacing|menacing]]_, and their eyes glow white, a dulled crimson, a dark green, or a strange violet. The variety of _shadow_ creatures is as vast as that on the Material Plane, creating dangers that are similar but have additional defenses and abilities characteristic of creatures truly native to the _Shadow_ Plane’s perpetual gloom.

_Shadow_ creatures on the Material Plane will produce offspring, giving rise to _shadow_ creature enclaves in dark corners of the world. Stranger still, a burgeoning ecology of _shadow_ creatures that forms a colony on the Material Plane seems to create a small blighted realm of _shadow_ where they dwell. As such, areas grow more and more overcast. Shadows become unnaturally deeper, darker, and more cloying until the land itself seems to assume the landscape and terrain of the _Shadow_ Plane. As part of this _[[spells/Transformation|transformation]]_ process, one of the more intelligent _shadow_ creatures in the area becomes a _shadow_ lord—a dread agent of _shadow_ that controls powerful _shadow_ abilities and works to expand its alien domain.
