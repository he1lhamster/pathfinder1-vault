  Anchor (Ex): As a move action, a seahorse can wrap its tail around a stationary
    object. The seahorse remains anchored to the object until it releases its grip
    (a free action) or is forcibly moved. An anchored seahorse gains a +4 bonus to
    its combat maneuver defense and on checks and saving throws against effects that
    would move it against its will.
desc_long: |-
  Giant seahorses are bear-sized versions of the common, harmless seahorse. Naturally docile and skittish, seahorses are easily trained to be mounts but are difficult to train for combat. They provide a smoother but slower ride than sharks or hippocampi.

  A giant seahorse is considered a quadruped for the purpose of carrying capacity. A light load for a giant seahorse is up to 500 pounds, a medium load is 1,000 pounds, and a heavy load is 1,600 pounds. It can drag 8,000 pounds.
