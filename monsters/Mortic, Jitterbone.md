special_abilities:
  Bone Spikes (Su): A jitterbone can elongate or retract its bones through the skin
    of its arms and hands as a standard action. Doing so doesn't harm the jitterbone.
    Elongated bones are treated as masterwork armor spikes that deal damage as a weapon
    two size categories larger than the jitterbone. The jitterbone is considered proficient
    with these bone spikes and can make a bone spike attack with each hand.
  Loose Bones (Ex): A jitterbone can wriggle its own loose skeleton into a tight,
    sinuous frame as a full-round action. It loses its damage reduction but gains
    the compression universal monster ability, allowing it to squeeze through smaller
    spaces. It can reverse this change as a swift action.
  Skeleton Scraper (Ex): A jitterbone's spikes can scar a target's skeleton. A creature
    damaged by a jitterbone's bone spike attack must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude
    save or take 1 point of Strength or Dexterity damage (the jitterbone's choice).
    On a critical hit, this damage is instead 1d4 points of Strength or Dexterity
    damage. This ability damage has no effect against a creature without a skeleton.
    Bone scars from this ability cannot cause more than 4 points of ability damage
    in total to a single creature. The save DC is Strength-based.
desc_long: |-
  Jitterbone mortics are halfling-like creatures with abnormally loose skeletons. With sufficient exertion of muscle control, jitterbones can control their skeletal structure, allowing them to shrug off crushing blows and slip through narrow spaces. They enjoy the taste of marrow- humanoid marrow in particular- and are adept at cracking and pulling their victim's bones. Jitterbones can be identified by their abnormally large heads. Their distinctive appearance and unusual appetites make jitterbones unwelcome in most halfling communities, so they form societies of their own in remote fields or forests. Among these communities of jitterbones, the most respected members are those that can contort themselves into the smallest or most awkward shapes; competitions to display this prowess and move up or down in the community's hierarchy are common. A traveler coming across one of these “bone churning contests” is likely to be plagued for years to come by the gruesome images of halflings twisting themselves into knots or shoving themselves through small pipes.

   Jitterbones in human communities live as many halflings do: they carefully keep themselves out of the public eye but try to make themselves valuable to larger races. Unlike halflings, jitterbones don't have a particularly strong work ethic, and they therefore tend to fall into roles that require little effort, such as vagrants or ragpickers.

   A typical jitterbone is 3 feet tall and weighs 35 pounds.

##### Description

Jitterbone mortics are halfling-like creatures with abnormally loose skeletons. With sufficient exertion of muscle control, jitterbones can control their skeletal structure, allowing them to shrug off crushing blows and slip through narrow spaces. They enjoy the taste of marrow— humanoid marrow in particular— and are adept at cracking and pulling their victim's bones. Jitterbones can be identified by their abnormally large heads. Their distinctive appearance and unusual appetites make jitterbones unwelcome in most halfling communities, so they form societies of their own in remote fields or forests. Among these communities of jitterbones, the most respected members are those that can contort themselves into the smallest or most awkward shapes; competitions to display this prowess and move up or down in the community's hierarchy are common. A traveler coming across one of these “bone churning contests” is likely to be plagued for years to come by the gruesome images of halflings twisting themselves into knots or shoving themselves through small pipes.

Jitterbones in human communities live as many halflings do: they carefully keep themselves out of the public eye but try to make themselves valuable to larger races.
