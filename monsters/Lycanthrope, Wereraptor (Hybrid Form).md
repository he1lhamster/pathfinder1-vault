  animal kin, wereraptors are calculating and insightful, making them particularly
  adept hunters. Their aesthetic traits vary based on their avian lineage, but wereraptors
  share a common array of physical properties. Natural wereraptors appear to be normal
  members of their humanoid race, though they have light hair, thin frames, and sharp
  facial features. They typically stand taller than other members of their race and
  have lithe bodies.

##### Description

Wereraptors fuse the senses of a predatory bird and the unique skills and traits of a humanoid, and thus enjoy _[[spells/Heightened Awareness|heightened awareness]]_ and nimbleness. Like their animal kin, wereraptors are calculating and insightful, making them particularly adept hunters. Their aesthetic traits vary based on their avian lineage, but wereraptors share a common array of physical properties. Natural wereraptors appear to be normal members of their humanoid race, though they have light hair, thin frames, and sharp facial features. They typically stand taller than other members of their race and have lithe bodies.
