Tieflings are humans with demonic, devilish, or other evil outsider blood in their ancestry. Often persecuted for their strange appearance and unnatural mannerisms, most tieflings disguise their nature or are forced to live on the fringes or underbelly of civilized society. Though they are not born evil, it is an easy path for them to find, especially as most suffer at the hands of “normal” folks while _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Growing|growing]]_ up. Tieflings look mostly human except for some physical traits that reveal their strange heritage.
