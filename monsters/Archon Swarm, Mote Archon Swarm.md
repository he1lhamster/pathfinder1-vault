    aid, treat a wound, or treat poison as a swift action; to treat a disease as a
    move action; and to treat a deadly wound as a full-round action. Creatures to
    be treated must share the mote archon swarm's space, but the mote archon swarm
    can treat any number of creatures within its space with the same action. A mote
    archon swarm does not require a healer's kit to treat deadly wounds.
  Vibrating Combustion (Ex): As a swift action, a mote archon swarm can vibrate rapidly
    for 1 round, heating the air and dealing 3d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC
    26 half) in addition to swarm damage at the end of its turn. Creatures that begin
    their turns in the swarm's area risk catching on fire (see page 444 of the Pathfinder
    RPG Core Rulebook). A creature that succeeds at its save against this ability
    is immune to catching on fire at the start of its next turn. A burning creature
    can't attempt to extinguish itself as long as it is in the mote archon swarm's
    space. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
  Mote archons are tiny, floating runes less than an inch across. Individually, they are benign and nearly mindless creatures, but mote archons are virtually never found alone, congregating naturally in groups of hundreds or thousands of their kind. Together, these swarms of mote archons have a unified personality and an overwhelming drive to comfort the sick and heal the injured. They are most often found on the battlefields of Heaven tending to injured angels and other archons, and never hesitating to defend creatures under their care. Angry mote archons oscillate rapidly until they ignite and swarm over enemies with fiery retribution.

  A mote archon swarm has no appreciable weight.

##### Description

Mote archons are tiny, floating runes less than an inch across. Individually, they are benign and nearly mindless creatures, but mote archons are virtually never found alone, congregating naturally in groups of hundreds or thousands of their kind. Together, these swarms of mote archons have a unified personality and an overwhelming drive to _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Comfort|comfort]]_ the sick and _heal_ the injured. They are most often found on the battlefields of Heaven tending to injured angels and other archons, and never hesitating to defend creatures under their care. Angry mote archons oscillate rapidly until they ignite and swarm over enemies with fiery _[[spells/Retribution|retribution]]_.

A mote archon swarm has no appreciable weight.
