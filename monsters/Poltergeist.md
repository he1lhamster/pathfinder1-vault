special_abilities:
  Frightener (Su): Once per minute as a standard action, a poltergeist can temporarily
    drop its natural invisibility, revealing itself to be a skeletal, ghost-like humanoid.
    All creatures within 30 feet when a poltergeist uses this ability must make a
    DC 14 Will save to avoid becoming frightened for 1d4 rounds. The poltergeist then
    resumes its invisibility at the end of its turn as a free action. A creature that
    successfully saves is immune to the fear effect of that poltergeist for 24 hours.
    If the poltergeist's natural invisibility is negated via other methods, it cannot
    use this ability. Likewise, those that can see invisible creatures are immune
    to this special attack. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Rejuvenation (Su): When a poltergeist is destroyed, it only remains destroyed for
    2d4 days. After this time, the undead spirit reforms where it was destroyed, fully
    healed. The only way to permanently destroy a poltergeist is to determine the
    reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace.
    The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research,
    and should be created specifically for each different poltergeist or group of
    poltergeists by the GM.
  Site Bound (Ex): A poltergeist cannot travel more than 120 feet from the point at
    which it was created or formed.
  Telekinesis (Su): A poltergeist has no method of attacking apart from telekinesis.
    This ability functions as the spell telekinesis, with a CL equal to the poltergeist's
    Hit Dice (CL 3rd for most poltergeists). A typical poltergeist has a ranged attack
    roll of +3 when using telekinesis to hurl objects or creatures, and can use the
    ability on objects or creatures of up to 75 pounds. If a poltergeist attempts
    to hurl a creature with this ability, that creature can resist the effect with
    a successful DC 12 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: A poltergeist is an angry spirit that forms from the soul of a creature
  that, for whatever reason, becomes unable to leave the site of its death. Sometimes,
  this might be due to an unfinished task-other times, it might be due to a powerful
  necromantic effect. Desecrating a grave site by building a structure over the body
  below is the most common method of accidentally creating a poltergeist. The poltergeist
  experiences great trauma over its condition; this trauma twists its psyche to evil
  and fosters an overall hatred of the living expressed in outbursts of rage. A poltergeist
  is bound to a specific place, usually a building, room, or recognizable area (a
  section of a cemetery, a stretch of lonely road, and so on). This place typically
  corresponds to its place of death or the resting place of its mortal remains.

Desecrating a grave site by building a structure over the body below is the most common method of accidentally creating a _poltergeist_.
