  Alert (Su): A bronze sentinel can take simple orders and identify intruders, and
    it possesses the ability to alert its creator or another creature to which it's
    keyed. When a bronze sentinel detects a trespasser, it can choose to alert the
    creature to which it's keyed in one of two ways. The sentinel can create a loud
    sound like that of a bell, chime, or gong that can be clearly heard at a range
    of 500 feet. Alternatively, a bronze sentinel can send a mental alert to the creature
    to which it is keyed as long as that creature is within 1 mile of the sentinel.
    The mental alert wakes the keyed creature from sleep, but doesn't affect normal
    concentration. A bronze sentinel's creator is the first creature to which it is
    keyed, and the creator can pass its link to another creature as part of a 4-hour
    ritual that uses materials costing 500 gp.
  Fiery Bolt (Su): As a standard action, a bronze sentinel can fire a bolt of flame
    as a ranged touch attack out to a maximum range of 30 feet. This bolt deals 1d6
    points of fire damage.
  Immunity to Magic (Ex): A bronze sentinel is immune to spells or spell-like abilities
    that allow spell resistance, save for spells with the electricity descriptor.
desc_long: Bronze sentinels were among the most common of Thassilonian sentinels,
  and saw widespread use in ancient Bakrakhan and Eurythnia. Thassilonian nobles and
  wizards used these creatures to protect their goods, magical laboratories, and libraries.
  A bronze sentinel's fiery bolt burns hot, but its f lames are short lived. This
  construction is in place to minimize the risk of the sentinel setting fire to the
  very things it is set to protect.

Thassilonian nobles and wizards used these creatures to protect their goods, magical laboratories, and libraries. A _bronze sentinel_’s fiery bolt burns hot, but its f lames are short lived.
