  Immunity to Magic (Ex): A robot golem is immune to spells or spell-like abilities
    that allow spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
    differently against it, as noted below. A magical attack that deals electricity
    damage deals half damage to the golem. Additionally, for 1d4+1 rounds the golem
    gains the benefits of haste and goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a
    rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing an object smaller than
    itself if no creature is within reach; it then moves on to spread more destruction.
    The golem comes back under the control of its creator when the duration ends.A
    transmute metal to wood spell reduces the robot golem's damage reduction by 5
    and its natural armor bonus by 9 for 1d4 rounds.A robot golem is affected normally
    by rust attacks, such as those of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.
  Rend Construct (Ex): This functions as the rend special ability, except the robot
    golem can rend only other constructs.
  Shockwave (Ex): A robot golem can release a pulse of electrical energy held within
    its nonfunctioning batteries as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds. This
    pulse is a 30-foot-radius spread that deals 8d6 points of electricity damage to
    all creatures in its area of effect (Reflex DC 19 half). The save DC is Constitution-based
    and includes a +2 racial bonus.
desc_long: When robots are damaged beyond the abilities of Numerian technologists
  to repair, salvages sometimes animate their frames via magic rather than science.
  What results is more of a walking mechanical corpse that lacks the intelligence
  and vulnerabilities of a true robot. The arcanists of the Technic League often employ
  these magically animated constructs to combat rogue robots or those under the control
  of their enemies.
