  Bardic Performance (Su): A dark dancer can use its dancing to help its allies. A
    dark dancer can use bardic performance as a 2nd-level bard, but only for distraction
    and inspire courage effects.
  Dark Curse (Su): As a standard action, a dark dancer can make a touch attack against
    a foe and curse it. The foe must succeed at a DC 12 Will saving throw to resist
    the effects. Creatures that fail the saving throw take a -2 penalty on all Dexterity
    and Charisma-based skill checks. This curse is permanent, but the victim of this
    curse can attempt a new saving throw each day.
  Death Throes (Su): When a dark dancer is slain, its body combusts in a flash of
    bright white light, leaving its gear in a heap on the ground. All creatures within
    a 10-foot burst must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1d6 rounds.
    Other dark folk within 20 feet must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be shaken
    for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
  Though still clad in the tattered dark clothing worn by other dark folk, dark dancers appear to be the most decorated and festive of these strange humanoids. They are intermediaries between clans and factions, and thus clans can't restrict the actions of dark dancers in their realms. Dark dancers answer only to dark stalkers and dark callers.

  Though fickle and erratic, dark dancers are well liked and usually welcome among clans for as long as they wish to stay. Yet they rarely stay long, instead insinuating themselves into dozens of underground communities over the course of a year. They serve as storytellers, entertainers, and messengers. One of their favorite stories to share is about the relationship between their kind and the owbs. Though dark dancers are rare and weak, they are highly appreciated by dark folk society. Dark folk consider it a bad omen when a dark dancer dies. Dark dancers stand just under 4 feet tall and weigh 60 pounds.

##### Description

Though still clad in the tattered dark clothing worn by other dark folk, dark dancers appear to be the most decorated and festive of these strange humanoids. They are intermediaries between clans and factions, and thus clans can’t restrict the actions of dark dancers in their realms. Dark dancers answer only to dark stalkers and dark callers.

Though fickle and erratic, dark dancers are well liked and usually welcome among clans for as long as they _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ to stay. Yet they rarely stay long, instead insinuating themselves into dozens of underground communities over the course of a year. They serve as storytellers, entertainers, and messengers. One of their favorite stories to share is about the relationship between their kind and the owbs. Though dark dancers are rare and weak, they are highly appreciated by dark folk society. Dark folk consider it a bad omen when a dark dancer dies. Dark dancers stand just under 4 feet tall and weigh 60 pounds.
