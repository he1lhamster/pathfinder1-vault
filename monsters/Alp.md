special_abilities:
  Crushing Leap (Su): An alp can perform a special leaping attack by jumping on top
    of an adjacent target of its size category or smaller. The target must succeed
    at a DC 22 Reflex save or take 2d6+3 points of damage and be knocked prone. The
    alp can immediately attempt to grapple this foe without provoking an attack of
    opportunity. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Nightmare Rider (Su): An alp controls the dreams of a sleeping target by sitting
    atop its torso. Once it does so, the alp becomes heavier and heavier, restricting
    the victim's breathing while inducing terrible nightmares and draining its blood.
    The victim can attempt a Perception check to waken, opposed by the alp's Stealth
    check (the Perception check modifier for the character being asleep is only +5,
    due to the alp's weight). If the sleeper fails to waken, the alp can use its blood
    drain ability against the victim and gains a +4 circumstance bonus to the save
    DC of its nightmare spell-like ability against that creature. If the creature
    fails the saving throw, it takes 1d6 points of Charisma damage in addition to
    the normal effects of nightmare.
desc_long: Alps are troublesome fey who disturb the dreams and drink the blood of
  sleeping victims. Unlike other dream-haunting monsters, alps are driven more by
  their capricious whims than any desire to do harm; when an alp drinks a victim's
  blood, it always takes care to leave him alive-if only so it can return at a later
  date to feed again. Alps despise bright light and avoid well-lit rooms, if they
  can. They enjoy playing pranks and causing minor mishaps. A typical alp stands about
  5 feet tall and weighs about 90 pounds.

##### Description

Alps are troublesome fey who disturb the dreams and drink the blood of sleeping victims. Unlike other dream-haunting monsters, alps are driven more by their capricious whims than any desire to do _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_; when an alp drinks a victim’s blood, it always takes care to leave him alive—if only so it can return at a later date to feed again. Alps despise bright light and avoid well-lit rooms, if they can. They enjoy playing pranks and causing minor mishaps. A typical alp stands about 5 feet tall and weighs about 90 pounds.
