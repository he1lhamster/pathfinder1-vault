   Equine bone golems are typically created to guard tombs or cairns of horselords or other people of high station in equestrian societies. A wealthy knight might pay to have the bones of a fallen steed fashioned into a golem to protect her crypt.particularly if the knight prefers guardians created by non.necromantic magic.or a decadent noble might choose to have his favorite racing horse entombed with him.

   Construction of an equine bone golem is the same as normal for a bone golem, except that at least one large horse skeleton must be included.

##### Description

Although bone golems are usually constructed in a humanoid shape, they can be fashioned into other forms. Among cultures that revere horses, equine bone golems are often a prized variant. Equine bone golems are constructed from the skeleton of a large _horse_, reinforced with bones from smaller creatures and sealed with sinew and resin. The hooves are weighted with stone or metal to deliver devastating stomp attacks.

Equine bone golems are typically created to _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_ tombs or cairns of horselords or other people of high station in equestrian societies. A wealthy _[[npcs/Knight|knight]]_ might pay to have the bones of a _[[monsters/Fallen|fallen]]_ steed fashioned into a golem to protect her crypt.particularly if the _knight_ prefers guardians created by non.necromantic magic.or a decadent noble might choose to have his favorite racing _horse_ entombed with him.

Construction of an equine bone golem is the same as normal for a bone golem, except that at least one large _horse_ skeleton must be included.
