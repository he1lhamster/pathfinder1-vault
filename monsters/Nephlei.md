  Crackling Whip (Su): A nephlei uses a magical whip fashioned from the essence of
    the air around her. This functions as a +1 shocking burst scorpion whip, but if
    it ever leaves the nephlei's possession, it immediately dissipates back into the
    air. A nephlei can make a new crackling whip with 10 minutes of work.
  Lifeburst (Sp): When a nephlei dies, she releases the electrical energies that she
    has built up in her body in the form of a lightning bolt. As soon as a nephlei's
    hit points are reduced to a negative amount equal to her Constitution score, her
    Constitution drops to 0, or she is killed outright by a spell or effect, she releases
    a lightning bolt that deals 9d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 20 half). The nephlei
    can choose where to aim the bolt as her final act. The bolt disintegrates the
    nephlei's body, leaving behind a trace of fine dust. The saving throw DC is Charisma-based.
  Unearthly Grace (Su): A nephlei adds her Charisma modifier as a racial bonus on
    saving throws, and as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.
desc_long: Often referred to as cloud nymphs, nephleis are outsiders who resemble
  those fey, but are formidable and inscrutable in their own right. Nephleis are solitary
  beings who build complex lairs within towering cloud formations on the Plane of
  Air. A typical nephlei stands 10 feet tall and weighs approximately 1,000 pounds.
