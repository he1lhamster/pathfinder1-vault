  Confusing Critical (Sp): If an abrakarn viper confirms a critical hit against an
    opponent with its bite attack, the opponent must succeed at a DC 23 Will save
    or be confused for 1 round (as lesser confusion). The save DC is Charisma-based
    and includes a +9 racial bonus.
  Demon-Souled (Ex): Bound demonic life force animates the viper, giving it the chaotic
    and evil subtypes.
  Find Master (Su): As long as an abrakarn viper and its diadem are on the same plane,
    the viper can unerringly find the diadem's wearer (or just the diadem, if it is
    removed).
  Guard (Ex): If so ordered, an abrakarn viper defends the wearer of the diadem. All
    attacks against the diadem's wearer take a -2 penalty when the wearer is within
    the viper's melee reach.
  Poison (Ex): An abrakarn viper's bite injects poison from a hidden reservoir within
    its body. The creator must refill this reservoir manually. The reservoir holds
    enough poison for three successful bite attacks, after which the creature merely
    deals bite damage. Refilling the reservoir takes 5 rounds and provokes attacks
    of opportunity. The creator can fill the reservoir with any injury poison (typically
    drow poison).
  Shield Other (Sp): The wearer of an abrakarn viper's diadem can activate this ability
    as a standard action when within 100 feet of the viper. This ability transfers
    half the damage that would be dealt to the diadem's wearer to the viper (this
    ability does not provide the bonuses to AC or on saving throws granted by the
    spell of the same name). Damage transferred in this way bypasses any defensive
    abilities the viper possesses (such as immunity or damage reduction).
desc_long: Demonic spirits imbue this serpentine construct with the unnatural power
  to protect anyone who wears its diadem of control.
