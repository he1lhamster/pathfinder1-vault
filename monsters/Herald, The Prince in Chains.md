title1: Herald, The Prince in Chains
is_3.5: true
desc_short: This horrid thing looks like a skinless wolf and stands taller than a
  house. Its oozing muscle and tissues twitch and quiver as terrible lupine maws form
  and melt away into its fleshless body. These fanged gashes struggle forth from the
  beast's gigantic mass, but are restrained by layers of heavy, rusted chains that
  dangle and lash, constrict and loosen seemingly of their own insidious accord. Around
  the hellish wolf, the world is flogged by chains and barbed tendrils, flensing all
  things that come near.

  Chainstorm (Ex): The area within 15 feet of the Prince in Chains is constantly assaulted
    with lashing chains and tendrils spontaneously grown from its tormented form.
    This area is treated as if constantly under the effects of the spell entangle,
    forcing any creature that enters the area to make a DC 25 Reflex save or be restrained.
    This save is Constitution-based. In addition, any creature in this area takes
    1d12 points of damage upon entering and every round thereafter, regardless of
    whether or not they make their save. If the Prince in Chains moves more than 10
    feet away from an entangled creature, it is released.
  Exaction (Su): The Prince in Chains is treated as having fast healing 10 any round
    it deals damage, regardless of how much damage it deals in that round after. It
    recovers no hit points on rounds it does not deal damage.
  Howl of Despair (Su): The Prince in Chains can loose a howl of immortal agony once
    every 1d4 rounds. All non-evil creatures within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 22
    Will save or take 6d6 points of sonic damage. In addition, all within 10 feet
    who fail their saves are affected as per the spell insanity. This is a sonic,
    mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  No Breath (Ex): The Prince in Chains does not breathe and is immune to inhaled toxins
    and diseases.
  Pass Without Trace (Su): The Prince in Chains is constantly affected by the spell
    pass without trace.
  Trip (Ex): If the Prince in Chains hits with its bite attack it can attempt to trip
    the opponent (+5 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack
    or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the trip attempt fails, the opponent
    cannot react to trip the Prince in Chains.
  Vicious (Ex): Any time the Prince in Chains confirms a critical hit, in addition
    to increased damage it also deals 2 points of Constitution damage.
desc_long: |-
  The Prince in Chains is the herald of Zon-Kuthon, a living embodiment of the suffering and loss the Midnight Lord seeks to sow across the world. If the Dark Prince is an artist on the canvas of f lesh and the f ine gradations of pain are his pigments, the Prince in Chains is his dark masterpiece. The favor of the Midnight Lord has stripped the f lesh from the spiritwolf 's body and replaced it with haphazard layers of metal, leather, and the necrotic f lesh of other beings. Its tongue has been embedded with dozens of barbed hooks and razors to make its bite far more terrible and damaging. Zon-Kuthon himself gouged out the Prince in Chains's eyes to make them receptacles of his own dark will, in which it's said mortals can see the fathomless dark dreams of the god of pain himself.

  The Prince in Chains stands 18 feet tall and-bound in irons forged in the depths of Xovaikain-weighs nearly 3 tons. None have ever seen the beast without his shroud of chains, the torturous bonds having become impossibly knotted with his grotesque tendrils and a fundamental part of his body.

##### Description

The Prince in Chains is the herald of Zon-Kuthon, a living embodiment of the suffering and loss the Midnight Lord seeks to sow across the world. If the Dark Prince is an artist on the canvas of f lesh and the f ine gradations of pain are his pigments, the Prince in Chains is his dark masterpiece. The favor of the Midnight Lord has stripped the f lesh from the spiritwolf ’s body and replaced it with haphazard layers of metal, leather, and the necrotic f lesh of other beings. Its tongue has been embedded with dozens of barbed hooks and razors to make its bite far more terrible and damaging. Zon-Kuthon himself gouged out the Prince in Chains’s eyes to make them receptacles of his own dark will, in which it’s said mortals can see the fathomless dark dreams of the god of pain himself.

The Prince in Chains stands 18 feet tall and—bound in irons forged in the depths of Xovaikain—weighs nearly 3 tons. None have ever seen the beast without his shroud of chains, the torturous bonds having become impossibly knotted with his grotesque tendrils and a fundamental part of his body.
