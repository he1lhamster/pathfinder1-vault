special_abilities:
  Amphibious (Ex): Although gandarevas are aquatic, they can survive indefinitely
    on land.
  Breath Weapon (Su): A gandareva can spew forth a wave of thick, acidic ooze (60-foot
    cone, once every 1d4 rounds, damage 14d8 acid, Reflex 26 DC half ). In addition,
    every square affected by a gandareva's breath is covered in this vicious slurry
    for 1 minute. If a creature in the area succeeded at its save, it is entangled
    within the sticky muck, but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult
    than normal. If a creature failed its save, it is entangled and can't move from
    its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 26 Strength
    check or a DC 26 Escape Artist check. Once loose (either by making the initial
    Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains
    entangled, but may move through the muck very slowly. Each round devoted to moving
    allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The creature
    moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10. The
    muck retains its acidic quality until it dissolves. Thus, any creature that ends
    its turn in a square affected by the slime takes 3d8 points of acid damage (one-fourth
    of the breath weapon's initial damage). This ooze is as equally effective underwater
    as it is on land. The save and check DCs are Constitution-based.
  Cursed to the Depths (Su): Once every minute, a gandareva can hiss a deadly curse
    that causes any single creature currently swimming to become much heavier and
    potentially begin sinking. The target must make a DC 23 Will save or instantly
    take a -10 penalty on all Swim checks as it feels unnaturally heavy for the next
    5 minutes. During this time, a victim, even one with a Swim speed, must make a
    Swim check every round to move. Every Swim check that fails by 4 or less means
    the target makes no progress swimming, while failure by 5 or more means the target
    sinks by 10 feet. Remove curse ends this effect immediately. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Swim-By Attack (Ex): Nimble in the water despite its size, a gandareva can attack
    while swimming and continue its movement. When using the attack action with one
    of its natural weapons, a gandareva can move both before and after the attack.
    The distance moved cannot be longer than a gandareva's swim speed. When a gandareva
    performs this action, it does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the creature
    attacked, but may draw attacks of opportunity from other creatures in the combat.
    A gandareva must move at least 5 feet both before and after the attack.
desc_long: A menace to the open waters, gandarevas terrorize ships that dare to sail
  through their domain. Frequently identified as sea serpents by superstitious sailors,
  gandarevas possess four mighty arms, capable of plucking travelers from the decks
  of their ships and flinging them into stormy seas. Their mighty wings serve them
  almost as well above the waves as beneath, allowing them to sail over the waves
  nearly as swiftly as they swim below them. An adult gandareva measures almost 30
  feet long and weighs upward of 15 tons.

### Special Abilities

**_Amphibious_ (Ex)** Although gandarevas are aquatic, they can survive indefinitely on land.

**_Breath Weapon_ (Su)** A gandareva can spew forth a wave of thick, acidic ooze (60-foot cone, once every 1d4 rounds, damage 14d8 acid, Reflex 26 DC half ). In addition, every square affected by a gandareva’s breath is covered in this _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_ slurry for 1 minute. If a creature in the area succeeded at its save, it is _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_ within the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sticky|sticky]]_ muck, but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal. If a creature failed its save, it is _entangled_ and can’t move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 26 Strength check or a DC 26 Escape Artist check. Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains _entangled_, but may move through the muck very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10. The muck retains its acidic quality until it dissolves. Thus, any creature that ends its turn in a square affected by the slime takes 3d8 points of acid damage (one-fourth of the _breath weapon_’s initial damage). This ooze is as equally effective _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_ as it is on land. The save and check DCs are Constitution-based.

**Cursed to the Depths (Su)** Once every minute, a gandareva can hiss a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ curse that causes any single creature currently swimming to become much heavier and potentially begin sinking. The target must make a DC 23 Will save or instantly take a –10 penalty on all Swim checks as it feels unnaturally heavy for the next 5 minutes. During this time, a victim, even one with a Swim speed, must make a Swim check every round to move. Every Swim check that fails by 4 or less means the target makes no progress swimming, while failure by 5 or more means the target sinks by 10 feet. _[[spells/Remove Curse|Remove curse]]_ ends this effect immediately. The save DC is Charisma-based.
**_Swim-By Attack_ (Ex)** Nimble in the water despite its size, a gandareva can attack while swimming and continue its movement. When using the attack action with one of its natural weapons, a gandareva can move both before and after the attack. The distance moved cannot be longer than a gandareva’s swim speed. When a gandareva performs this action, it does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the creature attacked, but may draw attacks of opportunity from other creatures in the combat.
