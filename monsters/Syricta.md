**Poison Cloud (Ex)** Once per day as a swift action,

mind-affecting effects).
**Snake Overrun (Ex)** The numerous snake heads and tails

of a _syricta_’s lower torso deal 6d6 points of bludgeoning,

piercing, and slashing damage to creatures when it succeeds

on an overrun combat maneuver against them. Creatures

that take damage from a _syricta_’s snake overrun are also

subjected to the _syricta_’s poison.

##### Description

_Serpentfolk_ breed syrictas by performing a ritual to

infuse a deformed _serpentfolk_ egg with the vital essence

from a clutch of snake eggs. The resulting amalgamation

is a nightmarish cross between a _serpentfolk_ and a mass

of writhing ophidian tails and heads.

Numerous snakes make up these abominations’ lower

halves, granting them a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Slithering|slithering]]_ form of locomotion.

Each _syricta_ also has a thick, muscled snake tail forming

one of its arms, allowing it to wrap around prey and

_[[spells/Squeeze|squeeze]]_ the life from them, while its other arm splits at

the elbow into two venomous snake heads, granting the

_syricta_ a total of three _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ bites. Despite being

much smaller than its main head, the arm heads

are possessed of unexpected strength for their

size, making them equally _deadly_. These heads

are also adept at manipulating objects, allowing

the _syricta_ to perform any action that would

require a hand—

such

as holding a weapon—

at

the expense of those bite

attacks.

These hideous monstrosities

serve the _serpentfolk_ as

bodyguards and enforcers, their

primitive minds conditioned to

obey their _serpentfolk_ masters. They

f ight to the death if so commanded,

though when they lack commands from

a _serpentfolk_, they act as brutish bullies

and cowards, viciously and sadistically

harming those weaker than themselves

but f leeing from foes that prove stronger.

_Syricta_ societies are harsh, ruled absolutely

by the strongest individuals, and rarely last

long due to syrictas’ inability to reproduce.

Most syrictas instead spend their lives serving

their _serpentfolk_ creators, rarely forming

relationships with other syrictas.

Syrictas are entirely

carnivorous. A typical adult

_syricta_ stands around 9 feet

tall and weighs 550 pounds.
