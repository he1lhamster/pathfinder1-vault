special_abilities:
  Capsize (Ex): An oma can attempt to capsize a ship or other vehicle by ramming it
    as a charge attack and attempting a combat maneuver check. The DC of this check
    is 25, or the result of the captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is
    higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the oma, the oma takes
    a cumulative -10 penalty on this combat maneuver check.
  Carrier (Ex): 'A creature swallowed whole by an oma can forgo attempts to cut itself
    out and instead attempt a DC 20 Reflex save on its turn. Success allows the creature
    to move into the creature's larger second stomach, where it can ride safely for
    an indefinite period without taking damage. When a passenger wishes to leave,
    it can cut its way free using the normal rules, or attempt an additional DC 20
    Reflex save to be safely excreted in a square adjacent to the oma. An oma's carrier
    stomach can hold up to one Gargantuan creature (or twice as many creatures of
    the next smallest size: two Huge creatures, four Large, and so on). At its option,
    an oma can choose to forgo the normal bite damage of swallowing whole, but not
    the acid damage of the first stomach.'
  Starflight (Ex): An oma can survive in the void of outer space, and soars through
    vacuum at incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip between two
    planets within a solar system should take 3d20 days, while one to another system
    should take 3d20 weeks (or more, at the GM's discretion), provided the oma knows
    the way to its destination.
desc_long: |-
  Oma soar through gas giants and the vast gulfs between planets on magical electromagnetic fields, feeding on cosmic materials strained from planetary rings and atmospheres with their energy baleen. Anything ingested by an oma is eventually sequestered in a surprisingly habitable second stomach before being excreted, and some alien creatures use oma as living starships, using telepathy to guide the colossi through the void.

  A typical oma is 150 feet long and weighs 250 tons.

##### Description

_Oma_ soar through gas giants and the vast gulfs between planets on magical electromagnetic fields, feeding on cosmic materials strained from planetary rings and atmospheres with their energy baleen. Anything ingested by an _oma_ is eventually sequestered in a surprisingly habitable second stomach before being excreted, and some alien creatures use _oma_ as living starships, using _[[universal monster rules/Telepathy|telepathy]]_ to guide the colossi through the void.

A typical _oma_ is 150 feet long and weighs 250 tons.
