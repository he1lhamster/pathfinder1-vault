special_abilities:
  Death Throes (Su): When a tooth fairy monarch is slain, it explodes into a cloud
    of chattering, biting motes that deals 3d6 points of piercing damage to all creatures
    within a 10-foot-radius burst and imparts the dazzled condition to them for 1d4
    rounds. A creature that succeeds at a DC 14 Fortitude save takes half this damage
    and is dazzled for 1 round. A tooth fairy monarch's scepter is destroyed by this
    explosion, but its other gear is unaffected. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Scepter (Su): Each tooth fairy monarch owns a heavy scepter of wood, scrap metal,
    and twine. In the hands of a tooth fairy monarch, the scepter functions as a +1
    morningstar. Any loose tooth the tooth fairy monarch touches to the scepter remains
    firmly adhered to it, requiring a successful DC 25 Strength check to remove, although
    a tooth fairy monarch can pluck a tooth from its scepter automatically with its
    tooth eater ability. The scepter has hardness 10 and 15 hit points. If a tooth
    fairy monarch's scepter is destroyed, all attached teeth fall free and the tooth
    fairy monarch is staggered until it can create another one, which requires 1 hour
    of work and a small amount of junk. Although a scepter can hold dozens of teeth,
    a tooth fairy monarch usually has only 1d6 teeth attached to its scepter when
    encountered.
  Tooth Eater (Su): Using its sinuous tongue, a tooth fairy monarch can grab and consume
    an unattached tooth within 5 feet as a move action, so long as the tooth is unattended
    or in its possession (such as attached to its scepter). The tooth fairy monarch
    regains a number of hit points equal to its Hit Dice (5 hit points for most tooth
    fairy monarchs), gains nourishment as though it had eaten a full meal, and recovers
    the use of one of its expended daily spell-like abilities of its choice (if any).
desc_long: |-
  The rare and reclusive leaders of clans of tooth fairies, tooth fairy monarchs rule their smaller, lesser kin with imperious commands and domineering bluster. These monarchs collect the teeth pulled by the lesser tooth fairies as tribute, affixing the teeth to their magical scepters or forming them into simple jewelry such as crowns, bracelets, or necklaces. A monarch can consume these teeth to gain a burst of supernatural nourishment. They find teeth of large, powerful creatures to be tastier than those of children or smaller creatures (such as other tooth fairies), but they will command their tooth fairy minions to offer up their own teeth for consumption as punishment for failure, or simply to remind onlookers of their authority.

   In combat, a tooth fairy monarch prefers to hold back behind a screen of tooth fairies, exhorting their minions to attack. Monarchs use their spell-like abilities to distract and debilitate foes while directing their minions to pull their enemies' teeth. Tooth fairies bring these teeth to the monarch, even in the middle of a fight, so the monarch can consume them on the spot or stick them to their scepters for later consumption. Fundamentally cowardly, a tooth fairy monarch encountered on its own usually attempts to flee using lies or magical trickery.

   A tooth fairy monarch stands 3 feet high and weighs about 30 pounds.

These monarchs collect the teeth pulled by the lesser tooth fairies as tribute, affixing the teeth to their magical scepters or forming them into simple _[[items/Mundane/Jewelry|jewelry]]_ such as crowns, bracelets, or necklaces.

In combat, a _tooth fairy_ monarch prefers to hold back behind a screen of tooth fairies, exhorting their minions to attack. Monarchs use their _spell-like abilities_ to distract and debilitate foes while directing their minions to _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ their enemies' teeth.
