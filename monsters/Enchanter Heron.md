  Throat Sac (Ex): As a standard action, an enchanter heron can fill the membrane
    beneath its beak with air. The membrane then glows with blue light, and creatures
    within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 13 Will saving throw or be fascinated. This
    effect lasts as long as the enchanter heron keeps the membrane filled with air,
    plus 1 additional round. An enchanter heron can hold air in its throat sac for
    up to 1 minute; releasing the air is a free action. The fascinated effect immediately
    ends if the enchanter heron moves more than 60 feet away from an affected creature.
    Any creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher receives a +4 bonus to
    its saving throw. Once a creature has been subject to this effect (whether or
    not its saving throw is successful), it is immune to it for the next 24 hours.
    This is a mind-affecting enchantment effect. The save DC is Wisdom-based.
desc_long: Enchanter herons are large birds with bioluminescent throat sacs-the result
  of prolonged exposure to magical fallout. Each stands about 8 feet tall and weighs
  500 pounds.
