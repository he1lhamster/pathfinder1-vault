special_abilities:
  Clashing Rocks (Ex): A plankta can scatter its rocky mass into multiple fragments
    with a shared consciousness and a shared pool of hit points, though it loses its
    stony cover ability when it does so. These fragments churn and clash, dealing
    4d6+14 points of bludgeoning damage per round to all creatures in a 60-foot-radius
    sphere in the water (extending up to 10 feet above the water's surface). Activating
    or maintaining this ability is a full-round action. If it chooses not to maintain
    this ability, the plankta's body reforms automatically at any point in the area.
    The save DC is Strength-based.
  Fiery Fault (Su): When a critical hit is confirmed against a plankta, its rocky
    form cracks and a gout of magma spews out in a 10-foot cone toward the attacker,
    dealing 10d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 31 half). Any creature that fails
    its save is entangled for 2d4 rounds and takes 5d6 points of fire damage each
    round at the beginning of its turn, but can attempt a new save each round at the
    end of its turn to end this damage. A creature can break free of the hardened
    magma and end the entangled condition as a standard action with a successful DC
    25 Strength check. This also ends the fire damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Rain of Boulders (Ex): As a standard action, a plankta can unleash a barrage of
    heated boulders that deals 12d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 6d6 points of
    fire damage (Reflex DC 31 half) in a 120-foot line. Huge or smaller ships that
    fail their saves are affected by the plankta's capsize ability, while creatures
    that fail their saves are affected by its push ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Stony Cover (Ex): A plankta's outer shell is covered in most places by ruin fragments
    that aren't part of its body, providing it improved cover at all times. As usual
    for improved cover, this grants the plankta improved evasion.
desc_long: |-
  Planktas are stony creatures formed from the shattered remnants of ancient island civilizations devastated and inundated by natural or magical cataclysms, and given life by unleashed magical energies and the anguished spirits of those lost in the tragedies that formed the planktas.

  These massive, rocky aberrations dwell in the seas. They burn with hatred for the ships and cities of empires that still stand, and seek to ruin such foes in the hope of creating more planktas, though this bizarre attempt at reproduction rarely succeeds.

  Some planktas are nomadic, wandering in search of prey, but others lurk in busy sea-lanes or narrow straits to shatter and sink ships attempting to pass.

### Special Abilities

**_Clashing Rocks_ (Ex)** A _[[monsters/Plankta|plankta]]_ can scatter its rocky mass into multiple fragments with a shared consciousness and a shared pool of hit points, though it loses its stony cover ability when it does so. These fragments churn and clash, dealing 4d6+14 points of bludgeoning damage per round to all creatures in a 60-foot-radius sphere in the water (extending up to 10 feet above the water’s surface). Activating or maintaining this ability is a full-round action. If it chooses not to maintain this ability, the _plankta_’s body reforms automatically at any point in the area. The save DC is Strength-based.

**Fiery Fault (Su)** When a critical hit is confirmed against a _plankta_, its rocky form cracks and a gout of magma spews out in a 10-foot cone toward the attacker, dealing 10d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 31 half). Any creature that fails its save is _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_ for 2d4 rounds and takes 5d6 points of fire damage each round at the beginning of its turn, but can attempt a new save each round at the end of its turn to end this damage. A creature can break free of the hardened magma and end the _entangled_ condition as a standard action with a successful DC 25 Strength check. This also ends the fire damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Rain of Boulders (Ex)** As a standard action, a _plankta_ can unleash a barrage of heated boulders that deals 12d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 6d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 31 half) in a 120-foot line. Huge or smaller ships that fail their saves are affected by the _plankta_’s _capsize_ ability, while creatures that fail their saves are affected by its push ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.
**Stony Cover (Ex)** A _plankta_’s outer shell is covered in most places by ruin fragments that aren’t part of its body, providing it improved cover at all times. As usual for improved cover, this grants the _plankta_ improved evasion.

##### Description

Planktas are stony creatures formed from the shattered remnants of ancient island civilizations devastated and inundated by natural or magical cataclysms, and given life by unleashed magical energies and the anguished spirits of those lost in the tragedies that formed the planktas.

These massive, rocky aberrations dwell in the seas. They _[[universal monster rules/Burn|burn]]_ with hatred for the ships and cities of empires that still stand, and seek to ruin such foes in the hope of creating more planktas, though this bizarre attempt at reproduction rarely succeeds.

Some planktas are nomadic, wandering in search of prey, but others lurk in busy sea-lanes or narrow straits to _[[spells/Shatter|shatter]]_ and sink ships attempting to pass.
