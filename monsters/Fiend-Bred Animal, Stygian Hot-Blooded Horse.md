  Smoke Resistance (Ex): Nonmagical smoke doesn't impair a stygian hot-blood's sight
    (creatures in smoke do not gain concealment from it), and it gains a +4 racial
    bonus on Fortitude saves to avoid coughing and choking because of nonmagical smoke.

  According to a tale, a Keleshite summoner named al-Aziz Bedaya made a deal with Savu, a nightmare lord hailing from the banks of the River Styx. In the deal, Savu allowed two of his bodyguards to each sire a colt with mortal Keleshite mares. The resulting hybrids- one coal-black with a blood-red mane and tail, the other dark gray with a fiery-orange mane and tail-became the legendary founding specimens of the two strains of the stygian hot-blooded horses. Combat-trained stygian hot-blooded horses fetch prices of up to 1,500 gp apiece.

  Other than their unusual coloration, stygian hotblooded horses' most distinctive characteristics are arched necks, refined heads, and high-held tails. The horses' meat has the flavor of smoked chili peppers and is considered a delicacy in many cultures, although their Keleshite breeders consider it an abomination to consume such fare. Stygian hot-blooded horses are bred to be fast, spirited war horses. Quieter and more intelligent than most horses, they're also ideal for raids that require stealth.

  Stygian hot-blooded horses stand 5 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh approximately 1,000 pounds.
