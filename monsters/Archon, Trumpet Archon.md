  Spells: Trumpet archons can cast divine spells as 14th-level clerics. They do not
    gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.
  Trumpet (Su): All creatures except archons within 100 feet of the trumpet's blast
    must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. The save
    DC is Charisma-based. The archon can also command its trumpet to become a +4 greatsword
    as a free action. Out of the archon's hands, it is a chunk of useless metal.
desc_long: |-
  Messengers of good deities and mighty celestials, trumpet archons serve as the vanguard of divine armies and rally the legions of heaven to war. When lawful good deities have the need to communicate directly with a group of mortals, they often send trumpet archons to act as their intermediaries. Trumpet archons speak with clear, musical voices. Their otherworldly eyes are white and pupilless.

  All trumpet archons carry a gleaming magical trumpet or horn with which they create wondrous music, sound calls to other archons, paralyze enemies, or defend the virtuous. They typically adorn their trumpet with the standard of their liege.
