### Special Abilities

**Bigger Inside (Su)** A _[[monsters/Ketesthius|ketesthius]]_’s

stomach is an extradimensional

space, much larger on the inside

than its physical size would allow.

A _ketesthius_ can swallow any

Gargantuan or smaller creature,

and its cavernous stomach is

an entirely new location, its size

varying wildly from _ketesthius_ to

_ketesthius_. Creatures swallowed by

the _ketesthius_ are not considered _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_, nor do they

take damage each round, and damage to the walls of the

stomach do not _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ the _ketesthius_ or allow the creatures to

escape. Creatures trapped inside can generally escape only

via teleportation magic that crosses planes or if the _ketesthius_

is defeated or _[[conditions/Nauseated|nauseated]]_ from outside. As a result of its

unusual anatomy and huge appetite, a _ketesthius_ often has

other monsters living inside its stomach, which in turn feed

on things the _ketesthius_ swallows. A _ketesthius_ usually has

from one to four monsters of CR 8–9 in its gullet. Sea creatures

like dire sharks, dire crocodiles, giant _[[monsters/Octopus|octopus]]_, or giant _[[monsters/Squid|squid]]_

are most common, but less frequently giants or other land-dwelling

creatures live in its gut as well. Ketesthiuses are even

known to swallow each other, though only on rare occasions.

##### Description

Ketesthiuses are large sea monsters with _[[monsters/Wolf|wolf]]_ like heads and

foreclaws, eel-like bodies, and powerful fish tails. They are

voracious eaters with great jaws that can gulp down prey

that can be as large as themselves. Creatures a _ketesthius_

swallows are not digested immediately,

because ketesthiuses’ vast stomachs and

unique anatomy allow them to sustain

living creatures inside their gullets

indefinitely. Entire ecologies can

form within a single _ketesthius_’s

extradimensional digestive tract.

Though the stomach’s ecosystem is

capable of supporting life, it’s far

from a welcome environment: no

sunlight comes in, the air is thin

and dank, and most creatures

trapped within become feral in

short order. Larger creatures that

end up inside a _ketesthius_ have

a difficult time surviving long

term, and must resort to quickly

snapping up prey that their host

later swallows.

Though it makes no attempt

to hoard treasure, within a

_ketesthius_’s vast gut lies all the

treasure of the creatures—and

even ships—that the _ketesthius_

has swallowed. More than once,

tales of lost treasure within have

led foolish adventurers to risk

being intentionally swallowed

by a _ketesthius_.

An adult _ketesthius_ typically

measures over 50 feet long. Its

weight varies based on the size of its

extradimensional gullet, but usually

ranges from 5–60 tons.
