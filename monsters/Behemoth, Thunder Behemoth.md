  Mighty Roar (Su): Every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a thunder behemoth can
    issue a mighty roar in a 60-foot cone that duplicates the effect of an empowered
    greater shout (Fortitude DC 30 for half damage). This is a sonic effect. The save
    DC is Constitution-based.
  Rock Spitting (Ex): A thunder behemoth can spit rocks from the essentially inexhaustible
    store in its gizzard. It can spit up to four rocks as a standard action, with
    a range increment of 60 feet. A creature that is critically hit by one of these
    rocks must make a DC 38 Fortitude save to resist being stunned for 1 round. The
    save DC is Strength-based.
  Swallow Whole (Ex): A thunder behemoth has five stomachs and can shunt a swallowed
    victim into any one of them (usually choosing an empty stomach).
desc_long: |-
  Thunder behemoths walk the land as little more than roving appetites, driven by an all-consuming hunger to devour every animal, plant, and even building in sight. They indiscriminately gorge their five seemingly bottomless stomachs on forests and jungles, collapse mine and mountain alike in search of ore, and raze settlements and strongholds for the cowering morsels within.

  Thunder behemoths are sent out by the gods to destroy wicked cities, raze great temples or monuments that offend divine eyes, and otherwise act as instruments of divine wrath either on the surface of a world or just below it. The days before a thunder behemoth arrives are fraught with minor but unnerving earthquakes, mass exoduses of burrowing animals to the surface, and an unexplained increase in fallen trees and sinkholes.

##### Description

Thunder behemoths walk the land as little more than roving appetites, driven by an all-consuming hunger to devour every animal, plant, and even building in sight. They indiscriminately gorge their five seemingly bottomless stomachs on forests and jungles, collapse mine and mountain alike in search of ore, and raze settlements and strongholds for the _[[conditions/Cowering|cowering]]_ morsels within.

Thunder behemoths are sent out by the gods to destroy wicked cities, raze great temples or monuments that offend divine eyes, and otherwise act as instruments of divine wrath either on the surface of a world or just below it. The days before a thunder behemoth arrives are fraught with minor but unnerving earthquakes, mass exoduses of burrowing animals to the surface, and an unexplained increase in _[[monsters/Fallen|fallen]]_ trees and sinkholes.
