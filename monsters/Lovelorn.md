  Cynic's Bite (Su): A lovelorn's bite curses its victim with apathy unless the victim
    succeeds at a DC 15 Will save. The victim is constantly fatigued and cannot benefit
    from morale bonuses. In addition to the normal methods of removing curses, this
    curse can be removed with the spell calm emotions or by consuming an elixir of
    love. This is a mind-affecting emotion curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Gloom (Su): A lovelorn's presence causes unnatural, thorny vines to grow. After
    5 days, an area claimed by a lovelorn grows cold, dark, and stale. This acts as
    a constant mirage arcana (DC 18) with a caster level equal to the lovelorn's Hit
    Dice. Lovelorns typically use this ability to conceal entrances to their lairs,
    but also to make their domains appear depressing and grim. A lovelorn can maintain
    only one gloom at a time, and while within an area of gloom, the lovelorn's spell-like
    ability save DCs increase by 1.
  Jagged Maw (Su): A lovelorn's bite threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20.
    If a lovelorn confirms a critical hit with its bite, it also inflicts a negative
    level. This negative level can be removed with a successful DC 15 Fortitude save.
    The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  Vicious creatures driven by misery and suffering, lovelorns arise from the souls of those who die when love takes a tragic turn-star-crossed lovers who committed suicide and victims of abusive relationships and violent family confrontations. In death, the stubborn spirit fixates solely on its heart, animating the dead organ and bursting free from its body, dedicated to unmaking everything it cared for in life. 

  Although these distressing undead monsters enjoy the sensation of using their fangs on living tissue, lovelorns thrive on feelings of misery rather than flesh, and their mere presence corrupts an area into a maze of despair and deadly traps. They may stalk and murder ex-lovers, but they just as often lurk in a home or community to seed misfortune and contempt, and feast upon the resulting anger and sadness. Their small size and ability to meddle with the memories and emotions of the living allow them to remain hidden for years, or even haunt a single family for generations. 

  A lovelorn's central body is almost twice the size of a healthy human heart, with 7 to 10 bone legs that stretch up to 2 feet long and resemble those of a spider

##### Description

_[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|Vicious]]_ creatures driven by misery and suffering, lovelorns arise from the souls of those who die when love takes a tragic turn—star-crossed lovers who committed suicide and victims of abusive relationships and violent family confrontations. In death, the stubborn spirit fixates solely on its heart, animating the dead organ and bursting free from its body, dedicated to unmaking everything it cared for in life.

Although these distressing undead monsters enjoy the sensation of using their fangs on living tissue, lovelorns thrive on feelings of misery rather than flesh, and their mere presence corrupts an area into a _[[spells/Maze|maze]]_ of despair and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ traps. They may stalk and murder ex-lovers, but they just as often lurk in a home or community to seed misfortune and contempt, and feast upon the resulting anger and sadness. Their small size and ability to meddle with the memories and emotions of the living allow them to remain hidden for years, or even haunt a single family for generations.

A _lovelorn_’s central body is almost twice the size of a healthy human heart, with 7 to 10 bone legs that stretch up to 2 feet long and resemble those of a spider
