  Hoarfrost Halo (Su): A bisha ga tsuku projects an aura of cold that freezes the
    surrounding air into a dense cloud of icy mist. This functions similarly to the
    spell obscuring mist, but the bisha ga tsuku can see through its own hoarfrost
    halo, and the halo moves with the bisha ga tsuku in a 30-foot radius. Creatures
    in the aura take 2d6 points of cold damage at the start of their turn due to the
    intense cold. This aura can be dispelled, but the bisha ga tsuku can resume or
    dismiss its hoarfrost halo as a free action.
  Soul-Thieving Chill (Su): Any creature that takes cold damage from a bisha ga tsuku's
    tentacle attack or hoarfrost halo must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or take
    1d4 points of Charisma damage. On a successful critical hit, a bisha ga tsuku
    deals an additional 1d6 points of cold damage, and the target takes 1d4 points
    of Charisma drain instead of Charisma damage on a failed save. The save DC is
    Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  Bisha ga tsukus are formed from souls drained of warmth, life, and love, leaving nothing but an empty void that can be filled only by taking from others. The creature is a horrific amalgamation of flesh comprising long feelers and a huge, distended sac. Its victims never see these features, however, since a bisha ga tsuku's presence sucks the warmth from the atmosphere around it, freezing the air into a dense cloud of icy mist. On an already foggy evening, the only sign of a bisha ga tsuku's presence is its three-toed feet making a squishing sound reminiscent of "bisha bisha" on the loose slush left behind by its hoarfrost halo.

  Bisha ga tsukus feed upon souls. Though their presence can disperse soul energy around them, they gain far more nourishment when they inhale a soul through the pores in their feelers. A bisha ga tsuku that gorges itself stores excess souls and dying heartbeats in its sac, mixing them with frost and chill until a new bisha ga tsuku forms within and bursts out.

##### Description

Bisha ga tsukus are formed from souls drained of warmth, life, and love, leaving nothing but an empty void that can be filled only by taking from others. The creature is a horrific amalgamation of flesh comprising long feelers and a huge, distended sac. Its victims never see these features, however, since a _bisha ga tsuku_’s presence sucks the warmth from the atmosphere around it, freezing the air into a dense cloud of icy mist. On an already foggy evening, the only sign of a _bisha ga tsuku_’s presence is its three-toed feet making a squishing sound reminiscent of "bisha bisha" on the loose slush left behind by its hoarfrost halo.

Bisha ga tsukus feed upon souls. Though their presence can disperse soul energy around them, they gain far more nourishment when they inhale a soul through the pores in their feelers. A _bisha ga tsuku_ that gorges itself stores excess souls and _[[conditions/Dying|dying]]_ heartbeats in its sac, mixing them with frost and chill until a new _bisha ga tsuku_ forms within and bursts out.
