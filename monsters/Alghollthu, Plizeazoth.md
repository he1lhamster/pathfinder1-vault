special_abilities:
  Mucus Cloud (Ex): While underwater, a plizeazoth exudes a 30-foot-radius cloud of
    transparent slime. Every creature within this area must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude
    save each round or lose the ability to breathe air (but gain the ability to breathe
    water) for 24 hours. Renewed contact with this mucus cloud and failing another
    save extends the effect for another 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Psychic Spike (Su): Each time a plizeazoth hits a creature with a tentacle attack,
    it releases a mental spike that embeds itself in the target's psyche. A plizeazoth
    can maintain a maximum number of spikes equal to the plizeazoth's Hit Dice (15
    for a normal plizeazoth). A psychic spike remains embedded in the target's mind
    for 1 hour, until it is detonated or until the target and the plizeazoth move
    more than 100 feet from one another. As a swift action, the plizeazoth can detonate
    any number of its own psychic spikes within 100 feet, dealing 1d6 points of nonlethal
    damage and 1d2 points of Wisdom damage per detonated psychic spike. The target
    can attempt a DC 25 Will saving throw once per detonation (not per spike) to halve
    the nonlethal damage and negate the Wisdom damage. This is a mind-affecting, pain
    effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Slime (Ex): A creature hit by a plizeazoth's natural attacks must succeed at a DC
    23 Fortitude save or have its skin and flesh transform into a clear, slimy membrane
    over the course of 1d4 rounds. The creature's new flesh is soft and tender, reducing
    its Constitution score by 4 as long as the condition persists. If the creature's
    flesh isn't kept moist, it dries quickly and the creature takes 1d12 points of
    damage every 10 minutes. Remove disease and similar effects can restore an afflicted
    creature to normal, but immunity to disease offers no protection from this attack.
    The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Tentacles (Ex): A plizeazoth treats its tentacles as primary natural attacks.
desc_long: |-
  One of the largest alghollthus, the raylike plizeazoths are merciless predators that torment their victims' minds, breaking them for impending service to other alghollthus. Plizeazoths rely on their primal instincts rather than intelligence to complete their tasks. Despite their powerful mental and psychological talents, many plizeazoths do not comprehend the true power they have, long ago bred into a life of subservience to their veiled master overlords. For millennia, the veiled masters subjugated their humanoid victims themselves, but eventually they decided to delegate this joyous yet time-consuming task to others. The veiled masters approached their ancient alghollthu rulers and requested subservient creatures to complete this task. The resulting plizeazoths were impressive in their physical might and ability to efficiently deal pain, but they were immune to such sensations themselves and thus unable to truly comprehend their value within alghollthu society. The brutish beasts are generally content to carry out their masters' orders, with little will of their own or motivation for them to break from their monotonous existence.

   Because they generally do not leave the alghollthus' deep underwater territories- and even then only to carry out specific orders given to them by the society's true masterminds- plizeazoths are largely unknown among land-dwelling cultures. Even their victims recall only their pain and suffering, with at best foggy recollections of their tormentors; the emotional and psychic scars left on their minds scour away all memory of the creatures. The rare victim who escapes a plizeazoth with her mind and memories intact recounts brutal assaults to her psyche, breaking down her reality into a twisted landscape of pain and crushing despair, the only escape from which, she believed, was eternal servitude to the plizeazoth's master.

   A plizeazoth has five ruby-red eyes, each capable of moving on its own, providing it a wide field of vision and excellent perceptive skills. Plizeazoths are bottomfeeders and, when not tormenting victims, typically scour the ocean floors for other alghollthus' scraps. A typical plizeazoth is about 22 feet wide and weighs approximately 4,400 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**Mucus Cloud (Ex)** While _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_, a plizeazoth exudes a 30-foot-radius cloud of transparent slime. Every creature within this area must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save each round or lose the ability to breathe air (but gain the ability to breathe water) for 24 hours. Renewed contact with this mucus cloud and failing another save extends the effect for another 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**_Psychic_ Spike (Su)** Each time a plizeazoth hits a creature with a tentacle attack, it releases a mental spike that embeds itself in the target’s psyche. A plizeazoth can maintain a maximum number of spikes equal to the plizeazoth’s Hit Dice (15 for a normal plizeazoth). A _psychic_ spike remains embedded in the target’s mind for 1 hour, until it is detonated or until the target and the plizeazoth move more than 100 feet from one another. As a swift action, the plizeazoth can _[[spells/Detonate|detonate]]_ any number of its own _psychic_ spikes within 100 feet, dealing 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and 1d2 points of Wisdom damage per detonated _psychic_ spike. The target can attempt a DC 25 Will saving throw once per detonation (not per spike) to halve the nonlethal damage and negate the Wisdom damage. This is a mind-affecting, pain effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
**Slime (Ex)** A creature hit by a plizeazoth’s _[[universal monster rules/Natural Attacks|natural attacks]]_ must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or have its skin and flesh transform into a clear, slimy membrane over the course of 1d4 rounds. The creature’s new flesh is soft and tender, reducing its Constitution score by 4 as long as the condition persists. If the creature’s flesh isn’t kept moist, it dries quickly and the creature takes 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. _[[spells/Remove Disease|Remove disease]]_ and similar effects can restore an afflicted creature to normal, but _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to disease offers no protection from this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Tentacles (Ex)** A plizeazoth treats its tentacles as primary _natural attacks_.

##### Description

One of the largest alghollthus, the raylike plizeazoths are merciless predators that torment their victims’ minds, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Breaking|breaking]]_ them for impending service to other alghollthus. Plizeazoths rely on their primal instincts rather than intelligence to complete their tasks. Despite their powerful mental and psychological talents, many plizeazoths do not comprehend the true power they have, long ago bred into a life of subservience to their veiled master overlords. For millennia, the veiled masters subjugated their humanoid victims themselves, but eventually they decided to delegate this joyous yet time-consuming task to others. The veiled masters approached their ancient alghollthu rulers and requested subservient creatures to complete this task. The resulting plizeazoths were impressive in their physical might and ability to efficiently deal pain, but they were immune to such sensations themselves and thus unable to truly comprehend their value within alghollthu society. The brutish beasts are generally content to carry out their masters’ orders, with little will of their own or motivation for them to break from their monotonous existence.

Because they generally do not leave the alghollthus’ deep _underwater_ territories— and even then only to carry out specific orders given to them by the society’s true masterminds— plizeazoths are largely _[[monsters/Unknown|unknown]]_ among land-dwelling cultures. Even their victims recall only their pain and suffering, with at best foggy recollections of their tormentors; the emotional and _psychic_ scars left on their minds scour away all memory of the creatures. The rare victim who escapes a plizeazoth with her mind and memories intact recounts brutal assaults to her psyche, _breaking_ down her reality into a twisted landscape of pain and _crushing despair_, the only escape from which, she believed, was eternal servitude to the plizeazoth’s master.

A plizeazoth has five ruby-red eyes, each capable of moving on its own, providing it a wide field of _[[spells/Vision|vision]]_ and excellent perceptive skills. Plizeazoths are bottomfeeders and, when not tormenting victims, typically scour the ocean floors for other alghollthus’ scraps. A typical plizeazoth is about 22 feet wide and weighs approximately 4,400 pounds.
