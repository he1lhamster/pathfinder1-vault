  Tusk (Ex): A charging narwhal can make a single gore attack with its tusk in place
    of its normal bite attack. If it hits, the tusk deals 2d6+14 points of damage
    with a ×3 critical multiplier.
desc_long: The narwhal is a skilled hunter in arctic waters, and has been known to
  dive deeper than even much larger cetaceans both in open water and beneath thick
  sheets of waterborne ice. Male narwhals possess a single, 6-footlong tusk extending
  from just above the mouth that serves to impress females during mating season, though
  in times of need the tusks may be used to break through thick ice or even in self-defense.
  A typical narwhal is 14 feet long (not including the tusk) and weighs 3,200 pounds.
