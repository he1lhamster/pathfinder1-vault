desc_short: Unspeakable pallid flesh twitches and quivers across the grotesque bulk
  of this vaguely insectile monstrosity. Behind a ravening maw of needle-sharp teeth
  twists a bulbous, eyeless head covered in a veined membrane. Beyond this amorphous
  mass coils a long, segmented body bearing dozens of scuttling legs covered in chitinous
  armor and ending in a pincer-like double stinger. The foremost legs are oversized
  and folded back like those of a mantis, but with jagged, metallic growths along
  its clawed edges.

special_abilities:
  Amphibious (Ex): The get of Iblis can survive equally well in or out of water.
  Devour Elemental (Su): This ability functions against any creature that has one
    or more of the elemental subtypes of air, earth, fire, or water. Any such creature
    that suffers bite damage from a get of Iblis gains one negative level. A get of
    Iblis can critically hit a creature with one of these subtypes with its bite attack
    even if the target creature is normally immune to or resistant to additional damage
    from critical hits-this represents the get of Iblis's ability to gnaw apart such
    creatures and consume portions of their body with shocking alacrity.
  Genie Sense (Ex): The get of Iblis can pinpoint genies within 100 feet, just as
    if it possessed the blindsense ability to that range.
  Penetrating Strike (Ex): The get of Iblis's natural weapons are embedded with growths
    of adamantine-these attacks bypass DR/adamantine.
  Poison (Su): Injury, Fortitude DC 25, initial damage 2d6 Str, secondary damage 2d6
    Str. The save DC is Constitution-based. If the initial saving throw is failed,
    the target is also affected by dimensional anchor (CL 15th) for 2d6 rounds.
desc_long: The get of Iblis (known to some as “Iblis's begotten” or the “brood of
  Iblis”) are massive, multi-legged wormlike creatures with vicious claws of adamantine
  and the ability to devour the very essence of genies and elemental creatures. Appearing
  much like monstrously huge parasites or insectile beings sculpted from the most
  unfit of living flesh, these things know only sleep and unrestrained hunger, proving
  endlessly ravenous for the lives of genie-kind. These revolting creatures' armored
  bodies grow as long as 60 feet and weigh as much as 100,000 pounds. They have no
  known natural limit to their life spans unless they meet a violent end.

# Get of Iblis
Unspeakable pallid flesh twitches and quivers across the grotesque bulk of this vaguely insectile monstrosity. Behind a ravening maw of needle-sharp teeth twists a bulbous, eyeless head covered in a veined membrane.

The foremost legs are oversized and folded back like those of a mantis, but with jagged, metallic growths along its clawed edges.
