### Special Abilities

**Polar Breach (Su)** As a full-round action that does not

provoke attacks of opportunity, a _[[monsters/Ningen|ningen]]_ can rapidly

submerge itself beneath the water and then launch itself

upward to break the surface and crash down. The _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Impact|impact]]_

produces flying chunks of ice dealing 10d6 points of

cold damage and 10d6 points of piercing damage to all

creatures and objects within a 30-foot radius. Creatures

that take cold damage are _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ and _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_ for

a number of rounds equal to the _ningen_’s Hit Dice, and

those that take piercing damage are _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ for the same

number of rounds. A successful DC 27 Reflex save halves

this damage and negates the _staggered_ effect. The save DC

is Constitution-based.

##### Description

Colossal but reclusive, ningens inhabit the coldest oceans

of the world, preying on fish and large arctic mammals

like walruses and even whales. A _ningen_ has long

armlike f lippers ending in sharp spurs that act as claws,

and a humongous tail that can propel it rapidly through

the water. The creature’s body is sheathed in layers of

thick, insulating blubber. Its face is oddly featureless,

with nothing more than a pair of small nostrils, two

large, black eyes, and a thin mouth containing rows of

large teeth.

Although intelligent and capable of communication,

ningens are distrustful of humanoids, particularly those

on seafaring vessels, due to a long history of their kind

being hunted by land dwellers. While the insulating

blubber that allows ningens to exist in the coldest

waters has some of the same uses as _[[items/Mundane/Whale oil|whale oil]]_, a _ningen_’s

supernatural link to cold makes its bones, its skin, and

even its teeth valuable to those seeking to craft or enchant

various magic items.

When threatened or angered, ningens make terrifying

opponents. Ningens always attempt to bring enemies

into the water, where they can use their abilities to

greater effect.

A _ningen_ is 90 feet long and weighs 180,000 pounds.
