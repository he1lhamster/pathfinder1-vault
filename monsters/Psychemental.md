### Special Abilities

**Mass Erasure (Su)** As a full-round action, a _[[monsters/Psychemental|psychemental]]_ can

move up to its speed and attack each creature whose space

it passes through with its _mindwipe_ ability. A target can

make an attack of opportunity against the _psychemental_ or

forgo its attack of opportunity to instead attempt a DC 19

Reflex save to evade the _psychemental_. A _psychemental_ can

affect each target only once per round, no matter how many

times its movement takes it through a target creature’s

space, and it can’t end its move inside a creature. The save

DC is Dexterity-based.

**_Mindwipe_ (Su)** A _psychemental_ can _[[spells/Erase|erase]]_ a portion of the

mind and experiences of a creature it touches, affecting the

creature as _mindwipe_ (CL 11th, Will DC 18 negates). Each

successful _mindwipe_ heals the _psychemental_ of 10 points

of damage. It gains any healing in excess of its maximum

hit points as temporary hit points for 1 hour, though

such temporary hit points do not stack. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

##### Description

As part of the fallout of a major

supernatural phenomenon or

mentally disturbing event, the

collective _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_ of

a population of _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_

beings can give rise to a

self-aware intellect

that’s known as

a _psychemental_.

These emergent

phenomena form on

the Astral Plane, where

they appear in the form

of _[[universal monster rules/Amorphous|amorphous]]_ fields

made up of f luctuating

colors, shapes, and even

faces that ref lect their

_[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Evolving|evolving]]_ thoughts and

new perceptions as they

attempt to come to terms with their new state of being.

While these inquisitive, unpredictable creatures are not

inherently evil, they do temporarily absorb fragments of

others’ minds in order to _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ themselves. And though

psychementals seek out interactions with intelligent

creatures for the pleasures of learning about the world

and socializing, an encounter with one can be a dangerous

affair if it feels threatened or provoked. Unfortunately,

this occurs fairly often, as the upsetting stimuli that

prompted a _psychemental_’s creation leave it more easily

startled than other creatures. A _psychemental_’s attacks are

never lethal on their own—the stolen mental fragments

eventually reform themselves within the victim’s mind

over time—but the potential to leave a victim comatose

for an extended period of time can be quite dangerous

in its own right. Yet sentient beings who approach a

_psychemental_ calmly and without any ill intent find the

creatures to be extremely engaging conversationalists,

and psychementals’ very natures guarantee that they

are experts in a variety of esoteric topics. A creature that

manages to make a _psychemental_ feel safe may have just

earned a highly unusual friend for life.
