special_abilities:
  Grasping Eddy (Su): As a standard action, a kigyo can create a powerful underwater
    eddy that holds its enemies in place. The oni selects a grid intersection within
    30 feet on or beneath the surface of a body of water as the center of the eddy.
    The oni can attempt an immediate grapple combat maneuver check against any enemies
    within a 10-foot radius of this point, as though the targets were within its reach.
    As a swift action in each subsequent round the eddy remains in place, the oni
    can maintain the grapple on those targets caught within the eddy's grasp (attempting
    a separate combat maneuver check for each target). In order to pin a target or
    deal damage with this effect, the oni must take a standard action as normal. The
    eddy persists as long as the kigyo continues to take at least a swift action on
    its turn to maintain a grapple. The effect immediately ends if all targets escape
    the eddy or if the kigyo does not spend any actions to use this ability, falls
    unconscious or dies, or moves more than 30 feet from the eddy's center. The kigyo
    can maintain only one grasping eddy at a time.
  Trident Mastery (Ex): Kigyos are experts at employing tridents as deadly weapons.
    The oni gains Weapon Focus (trident) as a bonus feat and treats a trident as having
    a range increment of 20 feet when underwater, even though throwing weapons underwater
    is normally ineffective for most combatants.
  Underwater Grappler (Ex): Kigyos are skilled grapplers and know how to use their
    underwater environs to their advantage when in close combat with their foes. A
    kigyo gains a +4 racial bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks while it or its
    target is at least partially underwater. This bonus also applies to grapple combat
    maneuver checks the kigyo attempts while using its grasping eddy ability. The
    kigyo gains no bonus to its CMD against grapple attempts.
desc_long: |-
  Oni are most often found in Tian Xia on the opposite side of the world from ancient Azlant, though some, such as the powerful ogre mage, have expanded their influence to include other continents including Avistan and Garund. Not all oni live on land, however, and the vengeful spirits have been known to take the form of humanoid species that dwell mostly or entirely underwater. While most oni are rare, those that take aquatic forms are scarcely ever encountered by terrestrial folk, though locathahs, merfolk, and other aquatic races are more likely to encounter these sea-dwelling oni than they are to meet ogre mages or other land-borne spirits. The most common submarine oni is the kigyo, which adopts a form resembling a corrupted parody of a merfolk.

   Like merfolk, kigyos have a torso and arms, with an aquatic lower body that allows them to maneuver lithely through the water. Unlike a merfolk, however, a kigyo has a monstrous face and its body more closely resembles that of a seahorse.

   A typical kigyo is 7 feet long from its head to the tip of its curved tail and weighs 190 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**Grasping Eddy (Su)** As a standard action, a kigyo can create a powerful _underwater_ eddy that holds its enemies in place. The oni selects a grid intersection within 30 feet on or beneath the surface of a body of water as the center of the eddy. The oni can attempt an immediate grapple combat maneuver check against any enemies within a 10-foot radius of this point, as though the targets were within its reach. As a swift action in each subsequent round the eddy remains in place, the oni can maintain the grapple on those targets caught within the eddy’s _[[spells/Grasp|grasp]]_ (attempting a separate combat maneuver check for each target). In order to pin a target or deal damage with this effect, the oni must take a standard action as normal. The eddy persists as long as the kigyo continues to take at least a swift action on its turn to maintain a grapple. The effect immediately ends if all targets escape the eddy or if the kigyo does not spend any actions to use this ability, falls _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_ or dies, or moves more than 30 feet from the eddy’s center. The kigyo can maintain only one grasping eddy at a time.

**_Trident_ Mastery (Ex)** Kigyos are experts at employing tridents as _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ weapons. The oni gains _Weapon Focus_ (_trident_) as a bonus feat and treats a _trident_ as having a range increment of 20 feet when _underwater_, even though _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Throwing|throwing]]_ weapons _underwater_ is normally ineffective for most combatants.

**_Underwater_ Grappler (Ex)** Kigyos are skilled grapplers and know how to use their _underwater_ environs to their advantage when in close combat with their foes. A kigyo gains a +4 racial bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks while it or its target is at least partially _underwater_. This bonus also applies to grapple combat maneuver checks the kigyo attempts while using its grasping eddy ability. The kigyo gains no bonus to its CMD against grapple attempts.

##### Description

Oni are most often found in Tian Xia on the opposite side of the world from ancient Azlant, though some, such as the powerful _[[monsters/Ogre|ogre]]_ mage, have expanded their influence to include other continents including Avistan and Garund. Not all oni live on land, however, and the vengeful spirits have been known to take the form of humanoid species that dwell mostly or entirely _underwater_. While most oni are rare, those that take aquatic forms are scarcely ever encountered by terrestrial folk, though locathahs, _[[monsters/Merfolk|merfolk]]_, and other aquatic races are more likely to encounter these sea-dwelling oni than they are to meet _ogre_ mages or other land-borne spirits. The most common submarine oni is the kigyo, which adopts a form resembling a corrupted parody of a _merfolk_.

Like _merfolk_, kigyos have a torso and arms, with an aquatic lower body that allows them to maneuver lithely through the water. Unlike a _merfolk_, however, a kigyo has a monstrous face and its body more closely resembles that of a seahorse.

A typical kigyo is 7 feet long from its head to the tip of its curved tail and weighs 190 pounds.
