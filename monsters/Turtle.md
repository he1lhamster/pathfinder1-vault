  Shell Retreat (Ex): A turtle can retreat within its shell as a swift action, gaining
    a +2 enhancement bonus to its existing natural armor. While in its shell, a turtle
    cannot take any action except to end the retreat. The turtle can end its retreat
    with a free action on its turn.
desc_long: Turtles are slow-moving reptiles with hard shells that they can retreat
  into when threatened. Many turtles have flippers and are better suited for swimming
  than walking. These statistics can also be used for tortoises, which have feet instead
  of flippers and live in arid regions.
