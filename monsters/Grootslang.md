  Aquatic Elusion (Su): As a standard action, a grootslang that is fully immersed
    in water can teleport to another body of water without error. This ability functions
    like tree stride, but the grootslang can exit from any body of water within 1
    mile so long as both the entry and exit are wide enough for the creature to enter.
  Impaling Bite (Ex): A grootslang can make a bite attack against any creature it
    is grappling with its tail. If this attack hits, it is automatically treated as
    a critical threat.
  Thunderous Stomp (Ex): As a full-round action, a grootslang can rear up on its serpentine
    body to bring its massive forelimbs down with awesome force. The grootslang chooses
    two adjacent targets to be affected as though trampling them. In addition, each
    creature within 10 feet must make a DC 28 Reflex save or be knocked prone. The
    save DC is Constitution-based
desc_long: |-
  Legends claim that the grootslang is a primordial creature as old as the world itself. Such tales state that in those ancient days, the gods-new to the crafting of things-made a terrible mistake in the grootslang's creation, for they gave it tremendous strength, cunning, and intellect. Upon realizing their mistake, the gods split the grootslang into separate creatures and thus created the first elephants and the first snakes. But one of the original grootslangs escaped, and from this first sire all other grootslangs were born. Scholars debate the veracity of such stories, and have looked to either biological or magical explanations of the creature's origins, but nevertheless bards and sages alike agree that the grootslang's fearsome reputation is well deserved.

  A grootslang's thick, leathery hide has a metallic sheen and a dull copper color, shot through with thin veins of green. Both males and females grow to a length of 60 feet and stand 20 feet tall. Little differentiation exists between sexes save for a lighter green hue to the female's hide. Grootslangs can weigh 20 tons and live up to 500 years.

  All grootslangs covet gems, particularly diamonds, and despite the creatures' lust for cruelty, victims can often bargain for their freedom by offering a grootslang enough precious gems.

##### Description

Legends claim that the _grootslang_ is a primordial creature as old as the world itself. Such tales state that in those ancient days, the gods—new to the crafting of things—made a terrible mistake in the _grootslang_’s creation, for they gave it tremendous strength, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cunning|cunning]]_, and intellect. Upon realizing their mistake, the gods _[[universal monster rules/Split|split]]_ the _grootslang_ into separate creatures and thus created the first elephants and the first snakes. But one of the original grootslangs escaped, and from this first sire all other grootslangs were born. Scholars debate the veracity of such stories, and have looked to either biological or magical explanations of the creature’s origins, but nevertheless bards and sages alike agree that the _grootslang_’s fearsome reputation is well deserved.

A _grootslang_’s thick, leathery hide has a metallic sheen and a dull copper color, shot through with thin veins of green. Both males and females grow to a length of 60 feet and stand 20 feet tall. Little differentiation exists between sexes save for a lighter green hue to the female’s hide. Grootslangs can weigh 20 tons and live up to 500 years.

All grootslangs covet gems, particularly diamonds, and despite the creatures’ lust for _[[feats/Cruelty|cruelty]]_, victims can often bargain for their _[[spells/Freedom|freedom]]_ by offering a _grootslang_ enough precious gems.
