  Blasphemous Bile (Su): Once per hour, an ayngavhaul can expel a 30-foot line of
    putrid bile. The bile deals 4d6 acid damage (Reflex DC 23 half). Even on a successful
    save, those struck by this bile are drenched in liquid corruption. Any non-evil
    divine spellcaster who casts a spell targeting a creature soaked in this bile
    must make a DC 23 caster level check to affect the creature or the spell fails.
    This bile can be washed off by a creature or ally that spends a round and uses
    at least a gallon of fluid; otherwise the effect last for 10 minutes per HD of
    the ayngavhaul. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Searing Words (Su): An ayngavhaul can speak words of torment,giving them shape and
    sending them streaking toward theirenemies as ranged touch attacks. Any good-aligned
    creature struck by one of these infernal words takes 4d6points of hellfire damage
    (half fire, half profane); non-good creatures take half damage. This is a sonic
    effect.
desc_long: |-
  Bloated scholars of despair, ayngavhauls collect, create, and spread heresies and apocrypha, sowing disbelief and corruption among all who would seek their foul wisdom.

  Ayngavhauls are roughly ovular in form, about 10 feet tall with their rolls of wet gristle spreading 13 feet wide.
