### Special Abilities

**_Banelight_ Aura (Su)** Creatures within a _banelight_’s aura and also in an area of bright light (generally the case because of the creature’s constant _daylight_) are _[[conditions/Dazzled|dazzled]]_ and affected as by the _[[feats/Spell Bane|spell bane]]_, with no saving throw. All magical light sources that come within a _banelight_’s aura turn bright red except those from her own _spell-like abilities_.

**Create _Will-o’-Wisp_ (Su)** Up to three times per day as a swift action, a _banelight_ can cause a single nonliving source of light (other than one she created) within the area of her _banelight_ aura to spawn an advanced _will-o’-wisp_ under her control. Will-o’-wisps created in this manner exist for up to 1 minute before vanishing. A single _banelight_ can maintain up to three will-o’-wisps at a time in this manner.

**Immune to Magic (Ex)** Banelights are immune to all spells and _spell-like abilities_ that allow _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ except _[[spells/Magic Missile|magic missile]]_, _[[spells/Maze|maze]]_, and their personal _daylight_ (which constantly affects them even though they aren’t an object).

**Light _Vortex_ (Su)** A _banelight_ can use its light vortices as melee touch attacks or ranged touch attacks with a 60-foot range. Each _vortex_ deals 5d8 points of damage to most targets, but deals 5d6 points of damage to constructs and inanimate objects, 10d6 points of damage to undead, and 10d8 points of damage to creatures specifically vulnerable to sunlight or bright light. This damage bypasses all _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_ and _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Energy Resistance|energy resistance]]_.
**Susceptible to _Darkness_ (Ex)** A _banelight_ gains much of its power from light. It can reactivate its _daylight_ on its turn if the effect is dispelled, but a _banelight_ in an area of _darkness_ does not have a _banelight_ aura, loses its _[[universal monster rules/Fast Healing|fast healing]]_, and is _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_.

##### Description

Banelights are _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_ fey who stalk mortals in the _darkness_ and loathe the increasing ubiquity of mortalmade light. Banelights are strangely social creatures, and they conduct bizarre courtship dances among themselves or with will-o’-wisps. In the absence of other fey to keep them company, banelights sometimes capture mortals to keep them entertained. While a good conversationalist can survive as a _banelight_’s “guest” for years, banelights are quick to dispatch companions who bore them.
