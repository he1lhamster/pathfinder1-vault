##### Description

Scarab beetles often mass in swarms and terrorize remote

desert regions. These vermin are a threat to ancient tombs

as they chew their way through the interred.

A _[[monsters/Scarab Swarm|scarab swarm]]_ comprises thousands of scarab beetles,

each filthy from its constant contact with dung and carrion.

Normally inattentive toward other creatures, scarab swarms

subject those who get in their way to thousands of sharp

bites as well as an infectious disease. Indeed, the bites of a

_scarab swarm_ are the least of their victims’ worries, as the

disease they carry claims far more lives than their hunger.

Some religious scholars theorize that scarabs are _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_

to swarming because they’re drawn to the same malign

energy that causes undead to rise, though most people

regard this explanation as pure superstition. Some

worshipers of gods of death see the arrival of a scarab

swarm as a portent of ill fortune.
