  Cacophonous Blow (Su): Whenever a kaminari deals damage with a slam or trample attack,
    it also deals 11d6 points of sonic damage. In addition, a creature struck with
    this ability is rendered permanently deaf. A creature that makes a successful
    DC 27 Reflex save takes half damage and avoids the deafening effect. The save
    DC is Constitution-based.
  Storm Ward (Su): A kaminari treats a specific mass of transient storm clouds as
    its ward. This storm is about 1 mile in diameter, and a kaminari can observe the
    world from any point within its storm ward, whether merged with it or in its physical
    form. A kaminari can only control the movement of its ward to a minimal extent,
    willing it to remain in one place or move in a cardinal direction for up to 2d4
    hours every day. After this time, the ward continues on its natural course for
    24 hours, after which the kaminari may will it to remain stationary again. When
    a kaminari is in its physical form and within its ward or within 120 feet of its
    ward's boundaries, it gains the power to call down bolts of lightning. The kaminari
    can call up to a total of 15 bolts of lightning each day, each of which deals
    5d10 points of electricity damage. This ability is otherwise identical to call
    lightning storm.
  Vulnerable to Silence (Su): A kaminari constantly surrounds itself with sound and
    music, and can't stand any form of silence. Whenever a kaminari is affected by
    a silence spell or effect or is rendered deaf by any means, it loses its cacophonous
    blow ability and its fast healing for the duration of the effect. But because
    a kaminari possesses incredible resilience to such effects, any silence or deafening
    effect lasts only 2d4 rounds or as long as the effect's duration states, whichever
    is shorter.
desc_long: |-
  Kaminaris are robust spirits of enormous size that watch over the balance of weather, taking the form of violent storms wherever they go. More monstrous-looking and boisterous than most kami, kaminaris are often mistaken for oni upon first glance, their unpredictable natures furthering the confusion. Kaminaris care little for most mortals, primarily concerning themselves with the maintenance and protection of their wards- enormous storm clouds that represent the awesome power of thunder and lightning. In addition to their duties guarding their storm wards and the balance of weather, kaminaris are endlessly fascinated with musical instruments, particularly drums.

  Kaminaris have vibrant skin and equally colorful features; the specific hues vary from kaminari to kaminari. A kaminari stands roughly 25 feet tall and weighs about 10 tons.
