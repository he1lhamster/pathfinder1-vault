    touched water within the last 24 hours gains cold resistance 5 instead.
  Oversized Limbs (Ex): A flood troll's hands are larger than its body would suggest.
    Flood trolls can wield Large weapons without penalty.
  Rain Regeneration (Ex): A flood troll's regeneration functions as long as the flood
    troll is touching flowing water or precipitation. Even a slight drizzle is enough
    to activate the flood troll's regeneration. However, any acid or fire damage dealt
    to the flood troll suspends its next round of regeneration.
desc_long: |-
  Flood trolls are the mutated runts of scrag broods, cast out by their mothers and destined to haunt the lonely valleys and river basins beneath Avistan's frosty peaks. They lurk amid the craggy hills of Belkzen, Varisia, and other wildlands of northern Avistan, and serve as a menace to orc raiders and human adventurers alike. While smaller and less organized than true scrags, flood trolls' solitary nature and desperation for food often drives them to commit atrocities upon unsuspecting humanoid populations-atrocities that almost invariably end with the flood trolls' eventual capture and execution.

  Flood trolls average 7-1/2 feet tall and weigh 250 pounds.
