### Special Abilities

**Ley Swim (Su)** Vishaps are fundamentally attuned to ley lines. As a full-round

action while within reach of a vishapakar standing stone

that is placed on a ley line, a _[[monsters/Vishap|vishap]]_ can swim the currents

of any ley line attached to that vishakapar at a rate of 10

miles per round (crossing to a different plane takes 10

rounds). This is a teleportation effect. The _vishap_ can sense

the exact shape and length of the ley line, and knows

exactly where each vishapakar along the ley line is. In

addition, the _vishap_ automatically knows the _[[spells/Status|status]]_ (as per

the spell) of each living creature along the ley line’s path or

attuned to the ley line. A _vishap_ can end its ley swim only

at a vishapakar, though it can travel along other ley lines

that connect with its current ley line.

**Poison (Ex)** Bite or poisoned blood—contact or injury; save Fort

DC 30; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Con; cure

2 consecutive saves.

**Poisoned Blood (Ex)** Any creature that comes into contact

with a _vishap_’s blood is subjected to the dragon’s poison.

A creature that deals melee damage to a _vishap_ must

succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save to avoid being exposed

to the poison, and an attacker using a natural weapon is

exposed automatically.
**Spells (Sp)** A _vishap_ casts spells as a 15th-level _psychic_.

**Vishapakar Affinity (Sp, Su)** A _vishap_ automatically succeeds

at any attempt to attune itself to a ley line if it makes that

attempt while adjacent to a vishapakar. It treats the effects

of any such ley line as if the ley line were 5 caster levels

higher. By concentrating as a standard action, a _vishap_ can

view the surroundings of a vishapakar on one of its attuned

ley lines as per greater _[[spells/Scrying|scrying]]_.

##### Description

Vishaps think of themselves as guardians of the ley

lines that connect the life forces of the Material Plane to

one another. Like all dragons, vishaps claim expansive

territories, but these territories often make little

geographical sense to others—a single _vishap_ might

claim unconnected areas on different hemispheres of a

planet, for example, and yet multiple vishaps sometimes

coexist within mere miles of each other with no apparent

animosity. To those attuned to the occult mysteries of ley

lines, however, the vishaps’ territorial borders are clear.

Each _vishap_ claims one or more networks of ley lines,

which may stretch for thousands of miles (or even across

galaxies), and sometimes overlap with each other without

ever touching. A _vishap_’s first priority is the integrity of its

ley line network, so any corruption of a ley line draws the

attention of the _vishap_ that cares for it.

Vishaps claim only small physical territories in places

where their ley lines coincide with interesting geography.

In these places, vishaps make _psychic_ contact with

intelligent creatures nearby, encouraging them to create

standing stones _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ vishapakars. A _vishap_ can’t place

a vishapakar on its own, but the presence of a vishapakar

on a ley line allows the _vishap_ a great deal of control

over that ley line. Evil or less diplomatic vishaps often

travel to these desirable locations to intimidate the local

people into appeasing the dragons with standing stones.

Vishapakars can stand for thousands of years, even as the

ley lines that they once marked drift and change course,

so a _vishap_ must return to each vishapakar periodically,

entreating (or forcing) locals to create new vishapakars

on the ley lines’ new locations. At particularly ancient

locations, it is possible to map the gradual drift of ley

lines by the age of the nearby vishapakars.

Vishaps become deeply attached to their ley line

networks over their millennia-long life spans, and can

live peacefully alongside other vishaps with nearby

networks. When ley lines drift and converge, however, it

often results in a mortal duel. Sometimes this happens

as a corporeal battle in the skies of a planet, or between

the dragons while in their ethereal forms. Most

commonly, vishaps engaged in mortal combat for

control of converging ley lines meet each other

in elaborate _psychic_ duels. These duels can last

for years, and often spill over into the Material

Plane, with each _vishap_ subtly manipulating the

creatures and locations along the converging ley

lines in a proxy war to defeat its opponent.

Vishaps keep their treasure hoards, like their

territories, in strange places, hidden in eddies of

_psychic_ energy along their favorite ley lines. A _vishap_’s

hoard might be physically scattered across dozens of

planes, though to the _vishap_ each cache is only minutes

away from the others. A _vishap_ favors items of _psychic_

signif icance, so one is as likely to find a mundane

wooden spoon that belonged to a powerful _[[classes/Occultist|occultist]]_

or the skull of a famous _psychic_ in a _vishap_’s hoard

as a magical sword or mountains of gold.

Vishaps procreate only once during their lives, as

tending to their ley lines takes priority over almost any

biological imperative. When a _vishap_ is finally ready to

mate, it commits its form wholly to the ley line network,

drifting listlessly along the _psychic_ currents. Inevitably,

it meets with some other drifting _vishap_, and the two

consciousnesses merge, exploding in a spray of _psychic_

force. The resulting motes of ethereal energy scatter across

the universe, slowly drifting back toward each other and

forming eggs, which sometimes drift along ley lines for

millennia before hatching a young, ethereal _vishap_ that

awakens to full consciousness upon hatching.

A fully grown _vishap_ is 70 feet from head to tail and

weighs 60,000 pounds.
