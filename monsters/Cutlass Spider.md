### Special Abilities

**Collapse (Su)** As a standard action, a _[[monsters/Cutlass Spider|cutlass spider]]_ can fall into a heap of blades and parts. Any creature occupying a square adjacent to a _cutlass spider_ when it collapses must succeed at a DC 17 Reflex save or take 2d6+5 points of slashing and piercing damage. While collapsed, a _cutlass spider_ is considered _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ and can take no action other than to reform itself as a standard action. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
**Shared Enhancement (Su)** Should a _cutlass spider_ have a magical weapon incorporated into its body (either given to it by its creator or stolen via its weapon thief ability), it applies the weapon’s enhancement bonus and special abilities to all of its _[[universal monster rules/Natural Attacks|natural attacks]]_. The construct benefits from the abilities of only the highest-value magical weapon incorporated into its body. For example, a _cutlass spider_ that incorporates a +1 _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Flaming|flaming]]_ _[[items/Weapon/Short sword|short sword]]_ gains a +1 enhancement bonus and the effects of the _flaming_ special ability on its claw and bite attacks. Should it later acquire a +3 holy _[[items/Weapon/Quarterstaff|quarterstaff]]_, the effects of the _short sword_ are replaced, and its claws and bite gain a +3 enhancement bonus and the holy special ability.

**Weapon Thief (Ex)** A _cutlass spider_ that disarms an opponent incorporates the disarmed weapon into its body. The weapon cannot be retrieved until the _cutlass spider_ is destroyed.

##### Description

Named for their association with mages in the service of privateer crews and pirate lords, _[[items/Weapon/Cutlass|cutlass]]_ spiders serve their creators as enforcers, bodyguards, and occasionally assassins. They are 8 feet long and weigh 1,500 pounds.
