  Gulp (Ex): A stargazer can open its giant mouth in a fraction of a second, creating

    checks to grapple.
  Poison (Ex): Venomous spines-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds;
    effect sickened for 1d4 rounds; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Shock (Ex): A stargazer delivers an electrical shock with each successful bite attack,
    dealing an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage.
  Venomous Spines (Ex): A stargazer has two large venomous spines situated behind
    its head. The stargazer reacts swiftly to attacks, stabbing at any creature that
    attempts to harm it. Each time a creature attacks a stargazer with a natural weapon,
    unarmed strike, or weapon attack that doesn't have reach, it must succeed at a
    DC 16 Reflex save or be hit by one of these spines. Each time a creature is hit
    by a spine, it takes 1d4 points of piercing damage and is exposed to the stargazer's
    poison. A creature that grapples a stargazer is automatically hit by these spines.
    The save DC to avoid the spines is Dexterity-based.
desc_long: A giant stargazer is an ambush predator with a speckled, flattened body
  that hunts by burying itself in the sand, leaving just its eyes and mouth uncovered.
  A typical giant stargazer is 6 feet long and weighs 250 pounds.
