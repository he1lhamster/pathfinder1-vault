    In addition to taking acid damage, any creature harmed by a caustic stalker's breath weapon must succeed at an additional DC 18 Fortitude saving throw or be affected by caustic creep poison.

    Caustic Creep-inhaled; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Chemical Burn (Su): Any creature struck by the caustic stalker, or that strikes
    it with a natural weapon or unarmed attack, is affected as if by the burn special
    attack, but takes acid damage instead of fire damage. The chemical burn persists
    for multiple rounds, just as a normal burn, but can be ended early if the affected
    creature is doused in at least 1 gallon of liquid (requiring a full-round action
    from the victim or another creature) or fully submerges itself in water.
  Misty Form (Su): A caustic stalker's body is composed of a semisolid chemical mist
    similar to thick foam. The caustic stalker does not have a Strength score and
    cannot manipulate or wear solid objects. This form grants it the amorphous defensive
    ability, and enables it to move through areas as small as 1 inch in diameter with
    no reduction to its speed. A caustic stalker cannot enter water or other fluids,
    and is treated as a creature two size categories smaller than its actual size
    (Tiny for most caustic stalkers) for the purposes of how wind affects it.
  Vulnerable to Wind (Ex): 'A caustic stalker takes damage every round that it's exposed
    to stronger than moderate winds: 1d6 points of damage for strong winds, 2d6 points
    of damage for severe winds, and an additional 1d6 points of damage for each wind
    force category beyond severe (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 439). Gust of wind
    is considered severe wind for this ability. A caustic stalker cannot use its breath
    weapon while being affected by stronger than moderate winds and for 1 minute afterward.'
desc_long: Though caustic stalkers arise from pockets of poisonous gas in the Plane
  of Air, they far prefer to congregate amid the great heat and pressure where the
  Plane of Earth and Plane of Fire meet. These conditions are also common in the depths
  of many worlds on the Material Plane. Caustic stalkers are usually content to drift
  amid the searing rocks and toxic fumes of volcanic depths, but occasionally emerge
  into more spacious areas. When they emerge, they are quick to lash out at anything
  that disturbs their explorations, especially if the area is windy.

##### Description

Though caustic stalkers arise from pockets of poisonous gas in the Plane of Air, they far prefer to congregate amid the great _[[universal monster rules/Heat|heat]]_ and pressure where the Plane of Earth and Plane of Fire meet. These conditions are also common in the depths of many worlds on the Material Plane. Caustic stalkers are usually content to drift amid the searing rocks and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Toxic|toxic]]_ fumes of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Volcanic|volcanic]]_ depths, but occasionally emerge into more spacious areas. When they emerge, they are quick to lash out at anything that disturbs their explorations, especially if the area is windy.
