  The tarsier is a carnivorous tree-climbing primate. The animal's neck is flexible, allowing its head to swivel around 180 degrees. Tarsiers hunt at night, silently waiting for insects and other small animals to fly or crawl by so they can jump at the prey and catch it. These shy animals live up to 12 years.

   The length of a tarsier from its head to the tip of its tail is about 1 to 1-1/2 feet, but when clinging to a tree, a tarsier appears to be about the size of a human's fist. A tarsier weighs about 4 ounces.

##### Description

The tarsier is a carnivorous tree-climbing primate. The animal’s neck is flexible, allowing its head to swivel around 180 degrees. Tarsiers hunt at night, silently waiting for insects and other small animals to fly or crawl by so they can _jump_ at the prey and catch it. These shy animals live up to 12 years.

The length of a tarsier from its head to the tip of its tail is about 1 to 1-1/2 feet, but when clinging to a tree, a tarsier appears to be about the size of a human’s fist. A tarsier weighs about 4 ounces.
