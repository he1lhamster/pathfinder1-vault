  Blessed Trill (Su): Once per day as a standard action, a chickcharney can emit a
    melodious trill that grants all creatures within a 20-foot radius a +1 morale
    bonus on saving throws for the rest of the day. This is a sonic, mindaffecting
    effect.
  Ill Luck (Su): |-
    When a chickcharney hits a creature with one of its natural attacks, the target is exposed to the chickcharney's curse.

    Curse of Ill Luck: save Will DC 14; effect the creature takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks. A creature can be affected by a curse of ill luck multiple times (up to a maximum cumulative penalty of -4). Chickcharneys are immune to this curse. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Maddening Screech (Su): Three times per day as a standard action, a chickcharney
    can emit a piercing cry that affects all other creatures within a 30-foot radius.
    An affected creature must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or become confused
    for 1d3 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

  Chelish explorers first came upon this strange magical bird during their early voyages to the Shackles. While the unusual creature was initially laughed at for its unsightly appearance and awkward gait, the tempestuous bird has nonetheless proven to be a force to be reckoned with in its own way. A chickcharney can grant good luck to those it deems worthy of its gifts, but its favor can just as easily turn to scorn, and a mere scratch from a chickcharney's accursed beak or claws has spelled the end for countless unwary seafarers.

  Naturally curious and trusting, chickcharneys freely approach most nonthreatening humanoids, even accompanying them for short times and often leaving their nesting spots unprotected if they have no eggs or mate. However, they are fickle things, and if they recognize hostility or rudeness, they inf lict all manner of chaos upon those who provoke them. Chickcharneys f iercely protect their eggs and young, their eggs being highly coveted by predators as well as humanoids. The shells are thought to possess alchemical properties that can be employed in numerous formulae, and many alchemists are willing to pay exorbitant sums for intact specimens.

  While some pirates of the Shackles continue to insist that encountering a chickcharney is a good omen, a much larger contingent gives the ornery and erratic bird a wide berth. A chickcharney is 3 feet tall and weighs 50 pounds.

##### Description

Chelish explorers first came upon this strange magical bird during their early voyages to the Shackles. While the unusual creature was initially laughed at for its unsightly appearance and awkward gait, the tempestuous bird has nonetheless proven to be a force to be reckoned with in its own way. A _chickcharney_ can grant good luck to those it deems worthy of its gifts, but its favor can just as easily turn to scorn, and a mere scratch from a _chickcharney_’s _[[feats/Accursed|accursed]]_ beak or claws has spelled the end for countless unwary seafarers.

Naturally curious and trusting, chickcharneys freely approach most nonthreatening humanoids, even accompanying them for short times and often leaving their nesting spots unprotected if they have no eggs or mate. However, they are fickle things, and if they recognize hostility or rudeness, they inf lict all manner of chaos upon those who provoke them. Chickcharneys f iercely protect their eggs and young, their eggs being highly coveted by predators as well as humanoids.
