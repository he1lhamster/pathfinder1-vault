  Squirrels are surprisingly wily creatures. When they know they are being watched, they pretend to bury nuts, but instead sneak them into their mouths and take them away to hide elsewhere when no one is watching. They eat most things, occasionally even preying on small snakes and birds.

   The average squirrel is roughly 1-1/2 feet long and weighs 1 pound.
