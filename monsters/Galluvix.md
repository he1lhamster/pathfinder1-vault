    \ into the fey plane of the First World in search of a magical wooden egg that\
    \ contains one of the following spells (the galluvix chooses): cure light wounds,\
    \ delay poison, lesser restoration, or remove paralysis. After 1 hour, the galluvix\
    \ returns to the spot from which it vanished (or the nearest unoccupied space),\
    \ clutching a trickster's egg in its jaws. The egg functions as a potion of the\
    \ contained spell, except it is cracked open rather than imbibed, and it functions\
    \ only for the galluvix or a single creature of the galluvix's choice. A galluvix\
    \ can have only one trickster's egg in existence at a time, and if the egg is\
    \ not used within a week, the contained spell is lost and the egg spoils into\
    \ rotten-smelling ash. The galluvix can't use this ability in an area where extradimensional\
    \ travel is blocked (such as by dimensional lock), and while it is in the First\
    \ World, it can't be contacted or observed by any means short of a miracle or\
    \ wish spell."
  Unlikely Form (Ex): Galluvixes are treated as both chickens and foxes for the purposes
    of effects that target creatures based on type, and they gain a +4 racial bonus
    on Survival checks to follow tracks by scent.
desc_long: |-
  A galluvix is a puckish magical creature that resembles a cross between a fox and a flamboyant rooster. Cunning, stealthy, and a bit slothful, galluvixes see no reason to hunt wild game when they can simply infiltrate nearby chicken coops and eat their fill. If confronted, a galluvix defends itself with a shrieking magical bark and then flees. When not on the prowl, however, they are social creatures that sometimes bond with humanoids who are willing to lavish them with attention and meals. A galluvix often rewards these individuals with the gift of a magical egg.

   A typical galluvix is about 2 feet tall and weighs about 10 pounds. Galluvixes show great variety in both fur color and plumage, with the males displaying particularly showy tail feathers.
