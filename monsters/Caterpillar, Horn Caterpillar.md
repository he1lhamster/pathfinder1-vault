  Unlike normal caterpillars, voracious giant horn caterpillars don't pupate into butterflies. Instead, they remain in their worm-like forms for their entire life cycle, growing between each molt until they eventually reach the size of large dogs.

  Horn caterpillars feed on the hooves and horns of dead ungulates, which they usually scavenge from corpses. Their sharp mandibles allow them to effortlessly shear through tendon and bone.
