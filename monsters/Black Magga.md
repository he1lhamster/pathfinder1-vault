  Breath of Madness (Su): Black Magga can exhale a cloud of foul-smelling, poisonous
    breath as a standard action once every minute. This cloud of black smoke fills
    a 60-foot cone. All creatures in the area take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage and
    become confused for 1d6 rounds (a DC 27 Will save halves the Wisdom damage and
    negates the confusion effect). This is a mind-affecting poison effect. The save
    DC is Constitution-based. This breath weapon cannot be used while underwater.
  Transdimensional Tentacles (Su): Black Magga's tentacles allow her to see into and
    infiltrate the Ethereal Plane and the Plane of Shadow while she is on the Material
    Plane. This allows her not only to be aware of these planes and the creatures
    there, but also to shift her tentacles through these planes to attack their inhabitants.
    She can even phase her tentacles in and out of existence, effectively reaching
    through walls and other solid barriers to attack foes on the other side, provided
    that area is not warded by a dimensional lock or similar effect. She can grapple
    foes with her tentacles normally, but cannot pull grappled foes or objects through
    planes as her tentacles shift between them.
  Warp Dimensions (Su): Black Magga's presence distorts the dimensions. Any creature
    that attempts to utilize a teleportation effect while within 300 feet of Black
    Magga must succeed at a DC 21 caster level check or the teleport effect fails.
    If the effect fails, the creature that attempted to create that effect must succeed
    at a DC 27 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

  Black Magga is one of the favored servants of Lamashtu and an embodiment of the goddess's reign over beasts, monsters, and madness. As an unholy auger of her will, Black Magga originally sought to confound the works of the civilized world, spread fear of monsters and the wilds, and direct Lamashtu's lesser servants in acts of depravity and bloodshed. Black Magga arrived in the Storval Deep not long after Karzoug flooded the immense quarry, and her presence in the newly formed lake brought much misery and dread to the Thassilonians who dwelt on the lake's shores or sailed its surface. Karzoug's interest in the region waned quickly, and he never bothered to take steps against the monster, prompting many to whisper that the runelord made a bargain with Lamashtu to place the monster in the Storval Deep, perhaps to hide some sort of great secret he had sunk beneath the waters. In any event, it was said that the goddess spoke directly to Black Magga, and for many, the words of the monster were equal to the commands of Lamashtu herself. 

  Bearing a head like a plesiosaur atop a thrashing mass of tentacles and eyes, Black Magga is an immense creature indeed. Although she is effectively immortal until slain, she has spent many of the more than 10,000 years since she first came to Varisia in deep hibernation. These slumbers could last for a dozen centuries or more at a time, and are punctuated by relatively short periods of activity that generally last for only a few decades. These long periods of sleep have had something of a debilitating effect on Black Magga, for with each century of slumber, she grows weaker. She is now but a shadow of her original power. That she remains as powerful as she does today speaks volumes to the terrible wrath she must have possessed back during the height of Thassilon, before the advent of Earthfall changed everything.

##### Description

_Black Magga_ is one of the favored servants of Lamashtu
and an embodiment of the goddess’s reign over beasts,
monsters, and madness. As an _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Unholy|unholy]]_ auger of her
will, _Black Magga_ originally sought to confound the
works of the civilized world, spread _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ of monsters
and the wilds, and direct Lamashtu’s lesser servants in
acts of depravity and bloodshed. _Black Magga_ arrived
in the Storval Deep not long after Karzoug flooded
the immense quarry, and her presence in the newly
formed lake brought much misery and dread to the
Thassilonians who dwelt on the lake’s shores or sailed
its surface. Karzoug’s interest in the region waned
quickly, and he never bothered to take steps against the
monster, prompting many to whisper that the runelord
made a bargain with Lamashtu to place the monster
in the Storval Deep, perhaps to hide some sort of great
secret he had sunk beneath the waters. In any event,
it was said that the goddess spoke directly to Black
Magga, and for many, the words of the monster were
equal to the commands of Lamashtu herself.

Bearing a head like a plesiosaur atop a thrashing
mass of tentacles and eyes, _Black Magga_ is an immense
creature indeed. Although she is effectively immortal
until slain, she has spent many of the more than
 10,000 years since she first came to Varisia in deep
hibernation. These slumbers could last for a dozen
centuries or more at a time, and are punctuated by
relatively short periods of activity that generally last
for only a few decades. These long periods of sleep have
had something of a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Debilitating|debilitating]]_ effect on _Black Magga_,
for with each century of slumber, she grows weaker. She
is now but a _shadow_ of her original power. That she
remains as powerful as she does today speaks volumes

during the height of Thassilon, before the advent of
