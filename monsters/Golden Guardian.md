  Conductivity (Ex): A magical attack that deals electricity damage speeds up a golden
    guardian (as the haste spell) for 1d4 rounds. A golden guardian gets no saving
    throw against electricity effects.
  Heat (Ex): A golden guardian's body generates intense heat, dealing 1d6 points of
    fire damage whenever it hits in melee, or in each round it grapples. Creatures
    attacking a golden guardian with unarmed strikes or natural weapons are also subject
    to the golden guardian's heat.
  Molten Destruction (Ex): When reduced to 0 hit points, a golden guardian superheats
    and instantly melts into a pile of molten gold. All creatures within a 10-foot-radius
    spread take 6d6 points of fire damage; a DC 14 Reflex save halves the damage.
    The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Heat Shimmer (Ex): The intense heat radiating from a golden guardian's body creates
    a wavering shimmer in the air that makes the construct difficult to see clearly.
    This functions as a blur spell (CL 8th), except it cannot be dispelled.
desc_long: |-
  Golden guardians are humanoid automatons formed of iron, steel, and most of all, gold. Their appearance can range from rough, lumpy humanoid shapes to statue-shaped conglomerations of gold coins to exquisitely detailed gilded statues with eerily accurate human faces. Golden guardians are powered by a fiery, molten core of pure gold, which radiates a shimmering heat.

  Golden guardians cannot speak, and move with the sound of metal scraping on metal. A golden guardian stands 7 feet tall and weighs 1,500 pounds.
