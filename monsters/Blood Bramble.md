  Bramble Incursion (Ex): Like a swarm, a blood bramble can move into areas occupied
    by other creatures. Its brambles weave quickly across the ground, wounding and
    tripping creatures sharing the same space. Moving into another creature's space
    is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Creatures sharing a space
    with a blood bramble are considered to be moving in difficult terrain. Each time
    a creature takes a move or standard action within the blood bramble's space, it
    must first succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save or take 1d8 points of piercing damage
    from the sharp thorns. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  Swift Trip (Ex): Whenever a blood bramble occupies the same space as another creature,
    it can attempt a special trip combat maneuver check as a swift action. The check
    affects all creatures that share the blood bramble's space and does not provoke
    attacks of opportunity. Any targets knocked prone by the trip combat maneuver
    take 1d8 points of piercing damage from falling into the sharp thorns.
  Vines (Ex): A blood bramble's vines constitute a primary natural attack that deals
    piercing damage.
desc_long: |-
  These aggressive, ambulatory brambles closely resemble large patches of normal bushes, a similarity they take advantage of with deadly efficacy. Although they are autotrophic, blood brambles also gain water and nutrients by consuming the blood of living creatures. They are avid hunters, though they are not known to be territorial. On rare occasions, they may take up permanent residence, but only in regions where both sunlight and prey remain plentiful, such as along trade routes. 

  Blood brambles attack by rushing into their opponent's space and weakening individuals by mercilessly thrashing them with thick, spiny vines. 

  A typical blood bramble is 12 feet wide and has a height of 7 feet. Its thorny flowers are most often a deep red, though a variety of different colors have been reported.

##### Description

These aggressive, ambulatory brambles closely resemble large patches of normal bushes, a similarity they take advantage of with _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ efficacy. Although they are autotrophic, blood brambles also gain water and nutrients by consuming the blood of living creatures. They are avid hunters, though they are not known to be territorial. On rare occasions, they may take up permanent residence, but only in regions where both sunlight and prey remain plentiful, such as along trade routes.

Blood brambles attack by rushing into their opponent’s space and weakening individuals by mercilessly thrashing them with thick, spiny vines.

A typical _blood bramble_ is 12 feet wide and has a height of 7 feet. Its thorny flowers are most often a deep red, though a variety of different colors have been reported.
