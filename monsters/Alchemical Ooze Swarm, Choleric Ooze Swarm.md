    but the ooze must remain in contact with the material for 1 full round in order
    to deal this damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Corrosive Slime (Ex): Choleric oozes are composed of caustic chemicals. Any living
    creature that begins its turn affected by the swarm's viscous ability takes 1d4
    points of acid damage. Armor or clothing worn by the creature takes the same amount
    of acid damage unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 15 Reflex saving throw. The

    As described in the sanguine ooze swarm's special abilities, except that the Reflex save DC is 15 and the patches are destroyed if the victim takes any amount of electricity damage.

    Formed from accumulations of runoff from arcane laboratories and regions of magical calamity, alchemical oozes are fist-sized blobs of volatile chemicals. Although composed of unpredictable compounds and toxins, these mobile oozes pose little threat individually, but in polluted quagmires and tainted sewers can collect in numbers great enough to threaten creatures many times their size. Swarms of the slimes linger in such contaminated areas and seek new accretions of vital solutions, like those found within the bodies of higher life forms, to fuel their erratic life cycles. Found in numerous varieties with a host of differing abilities, these weird, clinging oozes have been differentiated by likening them to the humors said to compose the bodies of living beings.

    Appearing at first to be a collection of tiny blobs of viscous, translucent fluid, alchemical oozes become far more terrifying once their hungry nature becomes apparent. Each swarm is composed of several hundred palm-sized balls of ooze that all scuttle along as a single unit.

### Special Abilities

**Acid (Ex)** A wooden or metal weapon that strikes a choleric ooze swarm takes 1 point of acid damage unless the weapon’s wielder succeeds on a DC 15 Reflex save. The ooze’s touch deals 8 points of acid damage per round to wooden or metal objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the material for 1 full round in order to deal this damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**_[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Corrosive|Corrosive]]_ Slime (Ex)** Choleric oozes are composed of caustic chemicals. Any living creature that begins its turn affected by the swarm’s viscous ability takes 1d4 points of acid damage. Armor or clothing worn by the creature takes the same amount of acid damage unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 15 Reflex saving throw. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Viscous (Ex)** As described in the sanguine ooze swarm’s special abilities, except that the Reflex save DC is 15 and the patches are destroyed if the victim takes any amount of electricity damage.
