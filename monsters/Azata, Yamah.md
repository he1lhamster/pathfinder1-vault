### Special Abilities

**Infused Weapon (Su)** Any _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Throwing|throwing]]_ weapon wielded by a yamah is treated as a +2 _[[spells/Returning Weapon|returning weapon]]_. This special ability fades 1 minute after a yamah no longer wields the weapon.
**Steal Magic (Su)** As a standard action, a yamah can make a touch attack against a creature under the effects of a spell or spells and attempt to dispel the effects as per _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ (CL 6th). If successful, the yamah absorbs the magical energy and converts it into a bolt of force. A yamah can use a force bolt to make a ranged touch attack that deals 1d6 points of force damage for every spell level of the effect dispelled by the yamah (for example, if a yamah dispels a 2nd-level spell with its steal magic ability, the resulting force bolt deals 2d6 points of force damage; 0-level spells count as being 1st level for the purpose of this ability). These force bolts have a range of 100 feet. A yamah can only carry a number of force bolts equal to its Charisma bonus (5 for most yamahs), and any force bolts not used within 24 hours of being obtained disappear and are wasted.

##### Description

Yamahs travel throughout the planes promoting the ideals of _[[spells/Freedom|freedom]]_ and _[[spells/Fairness|fairness]]_, using their unique talents to rob evildoers of their magic and turn it into a weapon for good. Yamahs harbor ill will toward anyone who would use magic for _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_ or evil purposes, especially necromancers and creatures that use magic to trap souls and pervert life.

Though yamahs often bear a stern countenance, they nonetheless enjoy lighthearted pranks and cheery jokes when appropriate. The white markings that cover their bodies may at first appear to be tattoos, but are actually natural sigils unique to each individual. The average yamah stands just over 6 feet tall and weighs 140 pounds.

Yamahs can often be encountered during lunar eclipses and other significant celestial events in regions where worship of any chaotic good deity or demigod is strong. Legends among such faiths claim that yamahs sometimes accompany good spellcasters on crusades against otherworldly fiends, though every story inevitably ends with the yamah mysteriously departing after the deed is done, abandoning its mortal partner without a word.
