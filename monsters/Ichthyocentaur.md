  Ichthyocentaurs, hybrids of hippocampi and more common merfolk, possess a culture that centers around communal growth fostered by mentoring and trading knowledge, songs, and services with small communities of the sea and coast. They idolize both memorable courage and wise stewardship. Ichthyocentaur warriors are known to challenge adventurers simply as a test of mettle and to offer guidance to respectful opponents whether the fight is lost or won. The leaders of ichthyocentaur tribes are usually bards, clerics, or oracles.

   Most ichthyocentaurs are nomads, migrating across coastlines and sea lanes along ancient routes and largely living off what they catch. They prefer to avoid larger civilizations for fear of conquest but often form mutually beneficial arrangements with tritons, coast-dwelling satyrs, and insular coastal elf communities. Elder members of the tribe often seek out powerful magical beings such as seilenoi and sphinxes from which to learn. Most ichthyocentaurs worship deities of nature, beauty, and passion, as well as godlike elder fey.

   An ichthyocentaur's humanoid torso generally has features reminiscent of those common in nearby human societies and skin tanned by the sun. They use armor when hunting or fighting but wear little else aside from a few pieces of meaningful jewelry, often fashioned from sea creatures like crabs (whose claws are favored for circlets).

   Although they are amphibious and often form relationships with terrestrial creatures, ichthyocentaurs are only able to move on land with difficulty and rarely travel out of sight of the water. They determine their carrying capacity as if they were a quadruped despite having only two legs.

   An average ichthyocentaur stands just over 5 feet tall when propped up by its legs and tail, is nearly 15 feet long from head to tail tip, and weighs over 1,700 pounds, but tribes from different areas vary significantly in build and size.

##### Description

Ichthyocentaurs, hybrids of hippocampi and more common _[[monsters/Merfolk|merfolk]]_, possess a culture that centers around communal growth fostered by mentoring and trading knowledge, songs, and services with small communities of the sea and coast. They idolize both memorable courage and wise stewardship. _Ichthyocentaur_ warriors are known to challenge adventurers simply as a test of mettle and to offer _[[spells/Guidance|guidance]]_ to respectful opponents whether the fight is lost or won. The leaders of _ichthyocentaur_ tribes are usually bards, clerics, or oracles.

Most ichthyocentaurs are nomads, migrating across coastlines and sea lanes along ancient routes and largely living off what they catch. They prefer to avoid larger civilizations for _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ of conquest but often form mutually beneficial arrangements with tritons, coast-dwelling satyrs, and insular coastal elf communities. Elder members of the tribe often seek out powerful magical beings such as seilenoi and sphinxes from which to learn. Most ichthyocentaurs worship deities of nature, beauty, and passion, as well as godlike elder fey.

An _ichthyocentaur_’s humanoid torso generally has features reminiscent of those common in nearby human societies and skin tanned by the sun. They use armor when hunting or fighting but wear little else aside from a few pieces of meaningful _[[items/Mundane/Jewelry|jewelry]]_, often fashioned from sea creatures like crabs (whose claws are favored for circlets).

Although they are _amphibious_ and often form relationships with terrestrial creatures, ichthyocentaurs are only able to move on land with difficulty and rarely travel _[[spells/Out Of Sight|out of sight]]_ of the water. They determine their carrying capacity as if they were a quadruped despite having only two legs.
