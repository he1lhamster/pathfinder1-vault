  Mock (Su): As a standard action, a mockingfey can take on the appearance of any
    creature it can see. This functions like veil, but affects only the mockingfey.
    The mockingfey does not change size, and if the creature it's mimicking is larger
    than itself, the mockingfey simply appears to be a miniature version of it. Anyone
    interacting with this effect can attempt a DC 12 Will save to see through the
    ruse. A mockingfey can maintain a guise indefinitely, but can't change to a form
    other than its own without a visual reference-once a given disguise has ended,
    the fey must see the subject again to resume that form. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  Mockingfey originally stem from the otherworldly realm of the fey, where they're regarded as entertainment by locals and nuisances by visitors, who are the usual butt of the creatures' pranks. The pint-sized fey often congregate in large colonies called japes or “mockingdells,” inhabiting the trees near a commonly traversed path or meadow. When an intelligent creature enters the grove, one of the bird-sprites flies down to perch on the traveler's shoulder or some nearby vantage. It then promptly uses its mock ability to appear as a perfect, miniature version of the creature in question, proceeding to cavort and imitate the newcomer in a most convincing and unflattering manner, mimicking the creature's tone but chattering only gibberish. 

  This gibberish is not solely for comic effect. While mockingfey are eager (if distractible) students in most matters and can speak and understand Sylvan when necessary, they generally refuse to use verbal language of any sort, believing that words unnecessarily constrain whatever they wish to describe. Instead, they communicate through gestures, pantomime, and elaborate dances. 

  While many people find mockingfey's antics irritating, the little creatures can make surprisingly useful allies, with a loyal, friendly nature toward those who treat them well and an insatiable curiosity that makes them surprisingly informed about their surroundings. This same curiosity extends to things most folks would leave alone, such as portal-like breach scars between the Material Plane and other realities. When such planar rifts occur between this world and the realm of the fey, mockingfey are often some of the first creatures through, and their presence in a region can be a reliable indication that such a breach between worlds exists somewhere nearby. In such situations, mockingfey often seek out more powerful fey creature to dwell near, as a source of both protection and entertainment. Of course, even fey can grow frustrated with the constant attention afforded by a jape of mockingfey! 

  Mockingfey can serve spellcasters as familiars, and often enjoy the opportunity such servitude affords to travel and see the world with the safety and protection provided by an allied spellcaster. Illusionists and other spellcasters who seek such puckish familiars often find them worth the resulting hassle-if just barely. A spellcaster must have the Improved Familiar feat, be chaotic neutral, and have a caster level of 4th or higher to gain a mockingfey familiar. 

  A mockingfey is 8 inches tall and weighs 2 pounds.

##### Description

_Mockingfey_ originally stem from the otherworldly realm of the fey, where they’re regarded as entertainment by locals and nuisances by visitors, who are the usual butt of the creatures’ pranks. The pint-sized fey often congregate in large colonies _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ japes or “mockingdells,” inhabiting the trees near a commonly traversed path or meadow. When an intelligent creature enters the grove, one of the bird-sprites flies down to perch on the traveler’s shoulder or some nearby vantage. It then promptly uses its mock ability to appear as a perfect, miniature version of the creature in question, proceeding to cavort and imitate the newcomer in a most convincing and unflattering manner, mimicking the creature’s tone but chattering only gibberish.

This gibberish is not solely for comic effect. While _mockingfey_ are eager (if distractible) students in most matters and can speak and understand Sylvan when necessary, they generally refuse to use verbal language of any sort, believing that words unnecessarily constrain whatever they _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ to describe. Instead, they communicate through gestures, pantomime, and elaborate dances.

While many people find _mockingfey_’s antics irritating, the little creatures can make surprisingly useful allies, with a loyal, friendly nature toward those who treat them well and an insatiable curiosity that makes them surprisingly informed about their surroundings. This same curiosity extends to things most folks would leave alone, such as portal-like breach scars between the Material Plane and other realities.

In such situations, _mockingfey_ often seek out more powerful fey creature to dwell near, as a source of both protection and entertainment. Of course, even fey can grow frustrated with the constant attention afforded by a jape of _mockingfey_!

_Mockingfey_ can serve spellcasters as familiars, and often enjoy the opportunity such servitude affords to travel and see the world with the safety and protection provided by an _[[feats/Allied Spellcaster|allied spellcaster]]_.
