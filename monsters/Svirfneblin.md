They have skin the color of _gray_ or brown stone. Males are bald, and females have stringy _gray_ hair. A _svirfneblin_’s ties to the eerie realm of the fey are much stronger than those of their surface-dwelling gnome kin, and this makes them either strangely detached from their emotions or violently random in their outbursts. _Svirfneblin_ have long fought wars against the _[[monsters/Duergar|duergar]]_, and have a difficult time seeing the difference between _duergar_ and other dwarves.
