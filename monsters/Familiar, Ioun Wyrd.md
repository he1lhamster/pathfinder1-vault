  Ioun Affinity (Su): An ioun wyrd can integrate a number of ioun stones into its
    body equal to 1 + half its Hit Dice. Because an ioun wyrd sees all ioun stones
    as equal and gains no benefits from them, the wyrd's ioun stones can be swapped
    out by any creature the wyrd trusts.
  Share Iouns (Su): A character with an ioun wyrd familiar gains the benefit of the
    wyrd's ioun stones as long as the character is within 30 feet of the ioun wyrd.
desc_long: |-
  At first glance, these creatures appear to resemble some manner of earth elementals, but they're actually bizarre constructs created by spellcasters from certain types of minerals and gemstones. Ioun wyrds are occasionally found in the wild, typically near the haunts of spellcasters and arcane societies where the strange little creatures escaped their former masters.

  A typical ioun wyrd is roughly 2 feet in diameter and weighs between 15 and 20 pounds.
