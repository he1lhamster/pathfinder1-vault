### Special Abilities

**Lost Time (Su)** As a touch attack, a _[[monsters/Khaei|khaei]]_ can touch a creature and prematurely age it. The creature touched must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage and be permanently aged 1d10 years. This effect also deals 1d4 points of damage to the _khaei_. Effects from multiple _khaei_ stack, though a single _khaei_ can use this power on a given opponent only once.

##### Description

The _khaei_ are a mystery even to themselves. Their twisted limbs give them an awkward, shambling gait, and their personalities are dull and incurious, making them seem in many ways to be simply degenerate humans. At the same time, their bodies’ tendency to trail off into mist and _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|shadow]]_, combined with their _[[spells/Weird|weird]]_ magical attack, suggests they could be much more. A typical _khaei_ stands 4 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.

By far the most unusual aspect of the _khaei_ is their ability to manipulate time. A _khaei_ in _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ for her life can _[[universal monster rules/Grab|grab]]_ an attacker and forcefully age him by several years, creating enormous strain on the foe’s body. This exertion does damage to the _khaei_ as well, and thus is rarely used, but a would-be tyrant who considers the _khaei_ easy pickings may find himself surrounded by a _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Weeping|weeping]]_ mob that quickly ages him into decrepitude—then forgives and cares for him. The few scholars who know of the _khaei_’s existence speculate that the creatures may themselves be somehow unstuck in time, perhaps sent back or forward from another era in preparation for a great event.

_Khaei_ live in small, isolated communities underground, often inhabiting a single cavern and refusing to explore beyond it or otherwise improve their situation. The only known enclave of _khaei_ in the Inner Sea region is in the Dark Forest, a cavern deep beneath the city of Kaer Maga, where they serve as both subjects and prey for the mysterious _[[monsters/Dullahan|dullahan]]_ _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ the Dark Rider. One of the most cherished stories of these _khaei_ concerns a time and place—somewhere in either the past or the future— when there were many more of them, their cavern-forests linked by magical standing stones.
