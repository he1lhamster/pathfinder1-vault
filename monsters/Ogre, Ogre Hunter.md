A common practice among depraved _ogre_ hunters who catch humanoid prey is to sever the victim’s hand, foot, or entire limb, cauterize the wound, and then force the creature to watch while the _ogre_ or his hungry _wolf_ companion devours the amputated body part; when the captive has no limbs left, it’s kicked around like a toy and finally roasted on a spit.
