    a +8 bonus on all Escape Artist checks and to its CMD against grapples, and imparts
    a -5 penalty on all Ride checks made by creatures attempting to ride a shantak.
  Starflight (Su): A shantak can survive in the void of outer space. It flies through
    space at an incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within
    a single solar system should take 3d20 hours, while a trip beyond should take
    3d20 days (or more, at the GM's discretion)-provided the shantak knows the way
    to its destination.

  Shantaks speak in a shrill voice that sounds like glass grinding against stone. They are intelligent creatures and cannot be trained as mounts-a would-be shantak rider must use diplomacy or magic to secure a shantak's cooperation as a mount, and even then, shantaks have a tendency to deliberately strand riders in dangerous areas.

  Many shantaks have a strange and irrational fear of certain creatures, such as the faceless nightgaunts said to dwell in certain remote mountains, or specific types of harpies or gargoyles in more civilized regions. A shantak avoids confrontations with these types of creatures if possible.

  A shantak's ability to travel the gulfs of space ensures that these scaly, bird-like creatures can be found on numerous worlds. Yet despite this unique ability, shantaks are generally quite reluctant to seek out new worlds unless faced with no other option, for a shantak knows well that an attempt to fly to an unknown world could easily result in being lost forever in the gulfs of space.

##### Description

Shantaks speak in a shrill voice that sounds like glass _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Grinding|grinding]]_ against stone. They are intelligent creatures and cannot be trained as mounts—a would-be _shantak_ rider must use diplomacy or magic to secure a _shantak_’s cooperation as a _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_, and even then, shantaks have a tendency to deliberately strand riders in dangerous areas.

Many shantaks have a strange and irrational _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ of certain creatures, such as the faceless nightgaunts said to dwell in certain remote mountains, or specific types of harpies or gargoyles in more civilized regions. A _shantak_ avoids confrontations with these types of creatures if possible.

A _shantak_’s ability to travel the gulfs of space ensures that these scaly, bird-like creatures can be found on numerous worlds. Yet despite this unique ability, shantaks are generally quite reluctant to seek out new worlds unless faced with no other option, for a _shantak_ knows well that an attempt to fly to an _[[monsters/Unknown|unknown]]_ world could easily result in being lost forever in the gulfs of space.
