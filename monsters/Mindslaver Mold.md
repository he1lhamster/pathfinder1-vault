special_abilities:
  Avoidance (Ex): When a mindslaver mold is infesting a living or undead creature
    and would be hit by an attack, it can make a Reflex save as an immediate action.
    If the mold succeeds, the attack doesn't harm it and instead harms the infested
    creature-the mold effectively slithers out of the way of the incoming attack so
    that the blow strikes the creature it controls. The mindslaver mold must choose
    to attempt avoidance after the attack roll is resolved but before damage is rolled.
  Infestation (Su): A mindslaver mold can climb onto and attach itself to a willing
    or helpless host as a standard action. As long as the mold infests its host, the
    mold shares the same 5-foot square with its host's space; this does not negatively
    impact the host or the mold. As long as a mindslaver mold infests a host, the
    host takes a -4 penalty on Will saves against the mindslaver mold's dominate person
    spell-like ability, and the duration of that spell-like ability on the host becomes
    permanent as long as the mold remains attached. Each day, an attached mindslaver
    mold deals 1d4 points of damage to its host as it feeds on the host's blood and
    other bodily fluids. A mindslaver mold can be torn free of a host with a successful
    DC 15 Strength check as a standard action-doing so deals 2d6 points of damage
    to the host as the mold's tendrils tear free. A dead mindslaver mold deals no
    damage in this way.
  Mold Mindlink (Su): A mindslaver mold can communicate telepathically with any other
    mindslaver mold within 10 miles, and knows the condition of all other mindslaver
    molds in this area as if it had a status spell in effect on all other molds.
  Spore Pod (Ex): A mindslaver mold's sole physical attack is to launch a spore pod
    the size of a sling bullet. This is a ranged touch attack that has a range increment
    of 20 feet.
  Spores (Su): Whenever a mindslaver mold hits a creature with its spore pod, or whenever
    a creature touches a mindslaver mold (including when a creature hits the mold
    with a touch attack, unarmed strike, or natural attack), the creature must succeed
    at a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage as the mold's spores
    swiftly drain away the victim's willpower and sense of self. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: Mindslaver mold is an infestation from the primal world of fey that is
  particularly common in remote forests, islands, and mountain valleys where it is
  sometimes worshiped as a strange god by isolated, primitive tribes. The mold is
  joined together by a single consciousness, though individual patches retain their
  own goals. It seeks humanoid hosts, parasitizing them and forcing them to serve
  as its bodyguards and protectors.
