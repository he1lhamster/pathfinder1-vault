### Special Abilities

**Aura of Tranquility (Su)** A lotus leshy

exudes a _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Calming|calming]]_ aura within a 20-foot

radius, which functions as _[[spells/Calm Emotions|calm emotions]]_

(Will DC 15 negates). A creature that

succeeds at the save is immune to

that leshy’s aura for 24 hours. The

save DC is Charisma-based.

**_Dream_ Pollen (Ex)** A lotus leshy can expel pollen in a 15-foot

cone. All creatures within the cone (as well as those who take

damage from seed spray) must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or

fall asleep for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
**Seed Spray (Ex)** A lotus leshy can shoot several of its seeds

at targets within 30 feet. It can shoot up to 6 seeds as a

standard action, dividing the seeds as it chooses among

targets in range. Each seed deals 1d3 points of nonlethal

damage. The leshy rolls a single attack roll to determine

the accuracy of all of the seeds in the spray. The attack has

a ×3 critical multiplier, and the leshy makes only one roll to

confirm a critical threat.

##### Description

Enigmatic lotus leshys are wise guardians of secluded

ponds and lakes. They spend most of their time in

meditation as lotus flowers, sometimes for decades at

a time. Although lotus leshys spend most of their time

floating in solitary ref lection, they do not shun the

company of other creatures, and take humanoid form

whenever they _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ to speak. They find discussions of

religion and philosophy particularly fascinating, and

delight in fresh perspectives. Although they study deities

of self-perfection and contemplation extensively, they do

not revere such beings.

Lotus leshys speak indirectly rather than providing

specific answers. They maintain that contemplation and

discussion are far more valuable than concrete answers,

whose usefulness is limited to the question at hand. In

addition, they believe those who receive direct answers

are more likely to blindly accept the words of others rather

than thinking for themselves. When confronted with

impatience, lotus leshys return to their lotus form rather

than engaging further. They avoid combat whenever

possible, preferring to calm tempers with their

tranquil auras or lull violent creatures to sleep

with their soporific pollen.

A typical lotus leshy stands 3 feet tall, and

weighs 15 pounds.
