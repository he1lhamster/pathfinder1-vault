  All-Around Vision (Ex): All giant sea urchins can see in all directions. They gain
    a +4 racial bonus on Perception checks and cannot be flanked.
  Poison (Ex): |-
    Glass urchin venom causes the senses to become clouded and creates vivid hallucinations and confusion in the victim's mind. The save DC is Constitution-based.

    Spines-contact or injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Wis and confused for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  Poison Spray (Ex): As a standard action, once every 5 rounds, a spear urchin can
    spray poison from numerous smaller spines across its body. This poison fills a
    20-foot-radius spread around the urchin- all creatures within this area are exposed
    to the urchin's venom and must make Fortitude saves as detailed above to resist
    Wisdom damage and confusion. This attack is even more effective underwater, as
    the poison spray creates a cloud that lingers in the area around the urchin for
    5 rounds-creatures must save each round they begin a turn in the area of the poison
    cloud in addition to when the urchin creates the effect.
  Spines (Ex): A glass urchin's spines can swivel and rotate to face any approaching
    creature that attacks it. Any creature that attacks a glass urchin with an unarmed
    strike or a natural attack, or any Huge or smaller creature that attacks with
    a one-handed weapon or light weapon, is automatically attacked by the glass urchin's
    spines as an immediate action. If the spines hit, they can poison the target as
    well.
  Transparency (Ex): |-
    A glass urchin's spines and body are transparent when underwater, granting the creature concealment and a constant 20% miss chance.

    Much more dangerous than their smaller kin, giant sea urchins are dangerous predators of opportunity. With the exception of the hunter urchin, giant sea urchins lie in wait for food to come to them, typically carried within reach of their attacks via ocean currents or, more commonly, tides.
  Hunter Urchins: ': These urchins can adjust their spines to effect an awkward method
    of locomotion on land. They actively seek prey, and possess long, rasp-like tongues
    that can whip out and pull food to them.'
  Spear Urchins: ': These brightly colored creatures can fire spines like javelins,
    relying upon poison to slow down prey or eventually immobilize it so they can
    crawl over to feed.'
  Glass Urchins: ': So named for their transparency, these beautiful creatures shimmer
    like delicate crystals. Yet for all the damage their spines can inf lict, victims
    of glass urchins generally do more damage to themselves or their allies due to
    the potent hallucinatory effects of this urchin's venom.'

### Special Abilities

**_All-Around Vision_ (Ex)** All giant sea urchins can see in all directions. They gain a +4 racial bonus on Perception checks and cannot be flanked.

**Poison (Ex)** _[[poisons/Glass Urchin Venom|Glass urchin venom]]_ causes the senses to become clouded and creates vivid hallucinations and _[[spells/Confusion|confusion]]_ in the victim’s mind. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Spines—contact or injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Wis and _[[conditions/Confused|confused]]_ for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves.

**Poison Spray (Ex)** As a standard action, once every 5 rounds, a _[[items/Weapon/Spear|spear]]_ urchin can spray poison from numerous smaller spines across its body. This poison fills a 20-foot-radius spread around the urchin— all creatures within this area are exposed to the urchin’s venom and must make Fortitude saves as detailed above to resist Wisdom damage and _confusion_. This attack is even more effective _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_, as the poison spray creates a cloud that lingers in the area around the urchin for 5 rounds—creatures must save each round they begin a turn in the area of the poison cloud in addition to when the urchin creates the effect.
**Spines (Ex)** A glass urchin’s spines can swivel and rotate to face any approaching creature that attacks it. Any creature that attacks a glass urchin with an unarmed strike or a natural attack, or any Huge or smaller creature that attacks with a one-handed weapon or light weapon, is automatically attacked by the glass urchin’s spines as an immediate action. If the spines hit, they can poison the target as well.

**Transparency (Ex)** A glass urchin’s spines and body are transparent when _underwater_, granting the creature concealment and a constant 20% miss chance.

Much more dangerous than their smaller kin, giant sea urchins are dangerous predators of opportunity. With the exception of the _[[classes/Hunter|hunter]]_ urchin, giant sea urchins lie in wait for food to come to them, typically carried within reach of their attacks via ocean currents or, more commonly, tides.

**_Hunter_ Urchins**: These urchins can adjust their spines to effect an awkward method of locomotion on land. They actively seek prey, and possess long, rasp-like _[[spells/Tongues|tongues]]_ that can _[[items/Weapon/Whip|whip]]_ out and _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ food to them.
**_Spear_ Urchins**: These brightly colored creatures can fire spines like javelins, relying upon poison to _[[spells/Slow|slow]]_ down prey or eventually immobilize it so they can crawl over to feed.

**Glass Urchins**: So named for their transparency, these beautiful creatures shimmer like delicate crystals. Yet for all the damage their spines can inf lict, victims of glass urchins generally do more damage to themselves or their allies due to the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ hallucinatory effects of this urchin’s venom.
