    creating up to 18 +1 shortspears, +1 spears, or +1 longspears in any combination
    (or substitute five +1 arrows or +1 crossbow bolts for each spear). These weapons
    retain their magic for 18 minutes, after which they become common weapons made
    of antler.
  Heroes' Feast (Sp): The Stag lies down and dies to begin the “casting” of this ability,
    its body becoming a magical feast feeding up to 18 creatures. At the next sunrise,
    it returns to life with full hit points.
  Protective Aura (Su): This ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4
    resistance bonus on saving throws, but only against attacks or effects from evil
    creatures.
desc_long: Erastil's herald is rarely seen more than once in a given generation, and
  only when a settlement is in mortal danger. All good creatures of the forest recognize
  its near-divinity and come when they hear its bugling call. Other than its mighty
  summons, it does not speak to humanoids. It stands 60 feet tall and weighs approximately
  140 tons.
