##### Description

Tulpas are constructed of ideas and imagination. Beings

of pure thought (some theorize that they are made of

the same mysterious substance as the Astral Plane),

tulpas are made physical by a powerful mind that is

either psychically attuned or has some amount of latent

_[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ power.

The exact process that creates a _tulpa_ is not well

understood. Sometimes such beings come about after years

of practice and meditation followed by an occult ritual.

Other times they seem to appear spontaneously, often after

their creators suffer traumatic experiences. More often than

not, in these latter cases, the creators are children. Such a

child witnesses something horrific or far too strange for her

nascent imagination to comprehend, and ends up creating

an imaginary friend to help her sort through the event and

protect her from other potential dangers. While most of

these imaginary friends are nothing more than figments

of her mind, every so often they manifest as tulpas. Some

such tulpas are noble creatures that protect the child who

created them, but just as many are malicious entities that

subtly torment the child or lead her astray.

While a _tulpa_ is a creature of thought created by the

imagination of another being, it has a will and a mind of

its own. This often leads to conf lict between a _tulpa_ and

its creator. In order to protect itself from _[[spells/Banishment|banishment]]_ or

worse, a _tulpa_ often attempts to compel others to think

and concentrate on its existence. This allows the _tulpa_

to create havens of other “creators” in case its original

creator forgets about the _tulpa_ or becomes incapacitated.

Nonetheless, even a sadistic _tulpa_ or a _tulpa_ with an

actively belligerent creator must protect its creator’s life

in order to _[[spells/Preserve|preserve]]_ its own existence.
