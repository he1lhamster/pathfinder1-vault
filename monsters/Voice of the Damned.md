### Special Abilities

**Blasphemous Embrace (Ex)** If the _[[monsters/Voice of the Damned|Voice of the Damned]]_ grapples a foe, it can, as a swift action, cause its pages to flense the _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ creature. The pages deal the _Voice of the Damned_’s swarm damage. If a creature takes any of this damage, it is subject to the swarm’s _distraction_ ability and must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude saving throw or be _[[conditions/Nauseated|nauseated]]_ for 1 round. The Voice can have only one embraced target at a time, but it doesn’t have to continue grappling in order to maintain the embrace. If the Voice moves more than 5 feet from the pages or dismisses them (a free action), the pages are rendered inanimate. Any severe or stronger wind effect or any area attack that would damage a swarm ends the embrace.

**Consume (Su)** If the _Voice of the Damned_ begins its turn with an opponent in its blasphemous embrace, it can attempt a new combat maneuver check as though attempting to pin the opponent. If it succeeds, its foe takes swarm damage and vanishes into a _[[spells/Nightmare|nightmare]]_ realm within the _Voice of the Damned_. The target must be of Large size or smaller. The _Voice of the Damned_ can’t consume a creature that has the good subtype or that is affected by _[[spells/Holy Aura|holy aura]]_. A consumed creature takes 8d6 points of damage each round as it drifts within the _Voice of the Damned_’s accumulated heresies. Nonevil creatures must also succeed at a DC 32 Will saving throw each round or be affected as per the spell _[[spells/Insanity|insanity]]_, though any creature that is _[[conditions/Deafened|deafened]]_ or affected by _[[spells/Silence|silence]]_ or a similar effect is immune to the _insanity_ effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Each round on its turn, a consumed creature can attempt a DC 20 Wisdom check as a full-round action. If the subject succeeds at this check on two consecutive turns, it escapes, emerging into a space adjacent to the _Voice of the Damned_. The _Voice of the Damned_ cannot attempt to consume an escaped creature again until 24 hours have passed. A consumed creature can also escape by using _[[spells/Plane Shift|plane shift]]_ or similar magic. The _Voice of the Damned_ is _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_ for 1 round and forced to expel all consumed creatures if a creature inside casts _holy aura_ or summons a creature with the good subtype, or if a creature (either inside or out) targets the _Voice of the Damned_ with _[[spells/Atonement|atonement]]_, _[[spells/Freedom|freedom]]_, or _[[spells/Holy Word|holy word]]_. The _Voice of the Damned_ can expel any consumed creature as a move action, causing the victim to appear in any square adjacent to it.

**Discorporate (Su)** The _Voice of the Damned_ can collapse into a cyclone of pages as a free action. All its carried, held, and worn items fall to the ground, and its Strength score drops to 1. The Voice functions as a swarm of Diminutive creatures while discorporated, with a reach of 0 feet (though its space remains unchanged). While discorporated, the Voice maintains its defensive abilities. It loses its claw, slam, and wing _[[universal monster rules/Natural Attacks|natural attacks]]_, but it can make a swarm attack and use its _spell-like abilities_. The _Voice of the Damned_ can reform into its _[[spells/True Form|true form]]_ as a full-round action as long as it has at least 1 hit point.

**Malevolence (Su)** As an immediate action, the _Voice of the Damned_ can attempt to merge its body with a creature it has consumed. This ability is similar to a _[[spells/Magic Jar|magic jar]]_ spell (caster level 25th), except that it does not require a receptacle. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 32 Will saving throw. If the creature fails, the _Voice of the Damned_ vanishes and the possessed creature reappears in its space (along with any other creatures the Voice had consumed). A creature that successfully saves is immune to the Voice’s malevolence for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Master of Symbols (Su)** The _Voice of the Damned_ can speak, read, and write all languages, as per the spell _tongues_. It casts any spell with the word ”symbol” in its name as though its casting time were a standard action, and once per day it can cast _symbol of death_ as a swift action. Additionally, it does not need a surface on which to inscribe symbols—they merely float in the air for their duration.

**Tenacious (Ex)** The Voice gains a +8 racial bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple and a +4 racial bonus to its CMD.

**Wracking _Gaze_ (Su)** The _Voice of the Damned_ has a _gaze_ attack with a range of 50 feet that deals 8d10 points of damage and 1d4 points of Strength damage. A creature that succeeds at a DC 32 Fortitude saving throw negates the Strength damage but not the physical damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

No physical tome, no matter how magical, could ever hope to contain every facet of the multiverse’s endless capacity for evil. Even if it could, the moment of the work’s completion would also be the moment it became outdated. Realizing this, Tabris employed an audacious solution. He sacrificed a vestige of himself and locked it in the library-cathedrals hidden within the book’s pages. These _[[spells/Shades|shades]]_ of Heaven’s scribe were the embodiments of all he had learned of chaos, evil, good, and law, so they were perfectly suited to judge and record new developments across the planes.

Yet this act, while fulfilling Tabris’s charge to record all there is to know in the multiverse, also ensured his exile from Heaven. The celestial choirs simply could not accept their brother’s decision to corrupt a piece of himself to create the entity they dubbed the _Voice of the Damned_, which serves as the _Book of the Damned_’s hidden caretaker. When the _Book of the Damned_ vanished from Heaven’s Great Library, many took it as proof that the Voice might be even more dangerous than they’d imagined. And in the eons since, the Voice’s knowledge, obsession, and power have only grown.

The _Voice of the Damned_ is a unique entity bound to the _Book of the Damned_’s demiplane. It can never bodily leave that demiplane (except via its malevolence ability), and it always knows the location of every piece of the _Book of the Damned_. It seeks to _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_ the book, its repository, and the Unspeakable Word at the demiplane’s center. As long as the Unspeakable Word is active, the _Voice of the Damned_ cannot be slain for long; it resurrects 24 hours later. It can be permanently killed only if the _Book of the Damned_ itself is destroyed.
