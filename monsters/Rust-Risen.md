  Absorb Electricity (Ex): When a rust-risen is damaged by electricity, it takes no
    damage (as if immune). Instead, the rust-risen gains 1 temporary hit point for
    every 4 points of damage it would have taken. A rust-risen can only have a number
    of temporary hit points equal to 150% of its hit point total. These temporary
    hit points disappear 1 hour later. If a rust-risen takes more than double its
    normal hit point total in electricity damage from a single attack, the creature
    is destroyed.
  Augmentations (Ex): Rust-risen have various pieces of malfunctioning machinery embedded
    in their bodies. Each of these augmentations provides the rust-risen with different
    abilities. A rust-risen has one augmentation plus one additional augmentation
    for every 3 Hit Dice the creature possesses (typically 2 for most rust-risen).
    The rust-risen presented here has the arm drill and metal jaw augmentations. See
    the next page for other augmentations.
  Malfunction (Ex): The machinery embedded in a rust-risen functions unpredictably
    in stressful situations. When a rustrisen enters combat, there is a cumulative
    1% chance each round that it malfunctions. This chance resets to 0% 1 minute after
    combat ends. When a rust-risen malfunctions, it takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls,
    saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1d4 minutes.
desc_long: Rust-risen lurk in the burned-out husks of ancient space-faring vessels
  and among the grease and blood stained laboratories of mad, technologist necromancers.
  These hideous undead mockeries riddled with the remnants of ancient technology-rotting
  creatures, outfitted with twitching relics of a spacefaring race, that prey on the
  living by tearing their victims to shreds with gnashing drills, vivisecting scalpels,
  and flailing exsanguination tubes.
