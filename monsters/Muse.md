  Art is Life (Ex): A muse is the master of all forms of art; she counts Craft and
    Perform as single skills and all Knowledge skills as class skills. She can use
    versatile performance as a bard for all categories of Perform. A muse's blindsight
    is sound-based.
  Inspiration (Su): A muse can inspire art and passion in her targets, as per a nymph's
    inspiration. The muse has a constant status spell cast on the creatures she is
    inspiring, and can project her senses to one of them, or teleport to a location
    within 100 feet of one of them, as a standard action. She can inspire a number
    of creatures equal to her Charisma bonus.
  Muse's Ward (Su): A muse incorporates solid music into her jewelry and clothing,
    granting her (but not others) a +4 armor bonus to AC and allowing her to add half
    her Charisma bonus to her Constitution bonus when calculating hit points. The
    notes also act as masterwork instruments for all types of Perform.
  Unearthly Grace (Su): A muse adds her Charisma modifier as a racial bonus on saves,
    and as a deflection bonus to AC.
desc_long: Muses are the fey incarnation of inspiration, rousing poets,musicians,
  and artists to greater works of beauty.
