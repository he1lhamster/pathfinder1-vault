### Special Abilities

**Adaptive Camouflage (Ex)** A _[[monsters/Stormghost|stormghost]]_’s

hide shifts coloration over time to match

its environment, granting it +4 racial

bonus on Stealth checks within the

_[[classes/Ranger|ranger]]_ favored terrain type matching its

current terrain. A _stormghost_ moving

to a different terrain must stay 1d4

weeks to gain the bonus.

**Impaling Leap (Ex)** As a standard

action, a _stormghost_ can leap onto a target at least one

size category smaller than itself and impale the victim.

The target suffers 6d8+16 points of piercing damage and

is _[[conditions/Pinned|pinned]]_ (DC 26 Reflex negates). The _stormghost_ must

maintain the pin as normal. _Pinned_ foes take impaling leap

damage each round. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
**Static Aura (Su)** A _stormghost_ can surround itself with crackling

electricity that leaps from its body. All creatures within 5 feet

of the _stormghost_ take 2d6 points of electricity damage at

the beginning of the _stormghost_’s turn. A _stormghost_ can

suppress or resume this ability as a free action.
**Static Blast (Su)** As a standard action, a _stormghost_ can focus its

static charge into a bolt, releasing it in a 40-foot line that deals

15d6 points of electricity damage. A successful DC 25 Reflex

save halves this damage. A _stormghost_ can use its static blast

once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

_[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cunning|Cunning]]_ hunters, stormghosts prowl lonely arctic tors,

so named by their victims for their ability to conjure

malignant weather and attack _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Unseen|unseen]]_. Stormghosts

search constantly for food, tracking animals and intelligent

creatures alike, and their appearances vary depending on the

season, allowing them to _[[spells/Blend|blend]]_ into any environment. While

stormghosts are thankfully rare, their _regeneration_ mitigates

the effects of aging, allowing them to live for more

than 2,000 years. A typical _stormghost_ stands 8

feet tall in its regular posture, but can extend

its legs to reach up to 14 feet, with its muscled

f lesh and hardened chitin armor making it

weigh roughly 1,500 pounds.
