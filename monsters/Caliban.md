  Share Deformity (Su): Once per day as a standard action, a caliban can make a melee
    touch attack against a humanoid creature. If it hits, the opponent must succeed
    at a DC 12 Fortitude save or have its form warped horribly. An affected creature
    takes 4 points of ability damage to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution (caliban's
    choice). Until this ability damage is healed, the caliban gains a +4 bonus to
    that same ability score. This ability damage heals automatically after 24 hours.
    A creature can't be affected by more than one instance of this ability at a time.
    This is a curse effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.
  Unsettling Scream (Ex): As a standard action, a caliban can wail horribly. All non-caliban
    creatures within 60 feet that can hear must succeed at a DC 12 Will save or be
    deafened for 1 round and shaken for 1 minute. A creature affected by this ability
    is immune to the unsettling scream of the same caliban for 24 hours, regardless
    of whether its save is successful. This is a sonic fear effect, and the save DC
    is Charisma-based.

  While an individual hag who has coupled with a human can only hope to birth a changeling (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 29), hag covens prove far more versatile in spawning monstrous progeny. The hags in such covens occasionally use their combined witchcraft to supernaturally create abominable male children-brutish monsters born of foul sanies and unholy ablutions that are stewed for days and then allowed to ferment into living creatures. These monsters go by many names among the hags who “birth” them, but among civilized races they are known by just one word: caliban.

  Calibans are free-willed but invariably inherit much of the vileness of their monstrous parents. Unlike changelings, calibans are usually raised among hags rather than in human settlements, since most societies would find a caliban's form too repulsive for any purpose other than obliteration. Thus calibans learn from an early age to trust only their mothers and to revile anyone else. Those calibans who for whatever reason find themselves apart from their hag mothers are the most likely to shed their evil ways and forge a path of their own, but such individuals are few and far between.

  Just as changelings are always female, calibans are always male, and since they are the result of hags' foul magics it is impossible for them to reproduce. The average caliban is 7 feel tall and weighs about 260 pounds.

##### Description

While an individual hag who has coupled with a human can only hope to birth a _[[monsters/Changeling|changeling]]_ (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 29), hag covens prove far more versatile in spawning monstrous progeny. The hags in such covens occasionally use their combined witchcraft to supernaturally create abominable male children—brutish monsters born of foul sanies and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Unholy|unholy]]_ ablutions that are stewed for days and then allowed to _[[spells/Ferment|ferment]]_ into living creatures. These monsters go by many names among the hags who “birth” them, but among civilized races they are known by just one word: _caliban_.

Calibans are free-willed but invariably inherit much of the vileness of their monstrous parents. Unlike changelings, calibans are usually raised among hags rather than in human settlements, since most societies would find a _caliban_’s form too repulsive for any purpose other than obliteration. Thus calibans learn from an early age to trust only their mothers and to revile anyone else. Those calibans who for whatever reason find themselves apart from their hag mothers are the most likely to shed their evil ways and forge a path of their own, but such individuals are few and far between.

Just as changelings are always female, calibans are always male, and since they are the result of hags’ foul magics it is impossible for them to reproduce. The average _caliban_ is 7 feel tall and weighs about 260 pounds.
