##### Description

Uintatheriums are large

browsing herbivores that

move through marshes,

plucking aquatic plants

from silty water with their

large front teeth. They

also use these front fangs

for defense when confronted

with a predator, and males—

who have larger fangs—use

them in mating displays.

Females also fight with their

teeth, though they prefer to

intimidate foes into leaving

them alone.

While an uintatherium has

a large, formidably protected

skull, its brain is rather small.

Dull-witted and _[[spells/Slow|slow]]_ to act, uintatheriums

are not particularly dangerous to those

who don’t intentionally provoke them, and

they can be domesticated more easily than

most megafauna.

Uintatheriums stand nearly 6 feet tall at

the shoulder and weigh over 2 tons.
