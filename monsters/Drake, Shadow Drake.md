  Shadow Blend (Su): In conditions of illumination other than bright light, a shadow
    drake disappears into the shadows, giving it concealment (20% miss chance). It
    can resume or suspend this ability as a free action.
  Speed Surge (Ex): Three times per day as a swift action, a shadow drake may draw
    on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional
    move action in that round.
  Stygian Breath (Su): As a standard action, a shadow drake can exhale a ball of black
    liquid that explodes into a cloud of frigid black mist. This attack has a range
    of 60 feet and deals 2d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 12 half) to all creatures
    within a 5-foot-radius spread. The mist snuffs out light sources in the area effect,
    extinguishing nonmagical light sources and dispelling light spells of 1st level
    or lower. Once a shadow drake has used its stygian breath, it cannot do so again
    for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
  Shadow drakes are mischievous and greedy. They often use their whiplike tails as third limbs, grasping small objects or even using their tails to work locks or swipe small objects they desire. Because they are so small and fast, they are master thieves and pickpockets. Unlike most drakes and dragonkin, shadow drakes like to haunt the fringes of civilization, often making lairs in abandoned buildings, forgotten attics, or unused bell towers, and stashing their tiny treasure hoards there.

  A shadow drake can be chosen as a familiar by a 7th-level evil spellcaster who has the Improved Familiar feat.

  Young shadow drakes are almost pure black and have lustrous hides. As they age, their scales lose this luster and turn dull gray. Much like their larger dragon cousins, shadow drakes are long-lived, and can reach 150 to 200 years in age.

##### Description

_Shadow_ drakes are mischievous and greedy. They often use their whiplike tails as third limbs, grasping small objects or even using their tails to work locks or _[[spells/Swipe|swipe]]_ small objects they desire. Because they are so small and fast, they are master thieves and pickpockets. Unlike most drakes and _[[monsters/Dragonkin|dragonkin]]_, _shadow_ drakes like to haunt the fringes of civilization, often making lairs in abandoned buildings, forgotten attics, or unused _[[items/Mundane/Bell|bell]]_ towers, and stashing their tiny treasure hoards there.

A _shadow_ drake can be chosen as a familiar by a 7th-level evil spellcaster who has the _[[feats/Improved Familiar|Improved Familiar]]_ feat.

Young _shadow_ drakes are almost pure black and have lustrous hides. As they age, their scales lose this luster and turn dull _[[monsters/Gray|gray]]_. Much like their larger dragon cousins, _shadow_ drakes are long-lived, and can reach 150 to 200 years in age.
