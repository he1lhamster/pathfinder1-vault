  Grasping Chains (Ex): An iron rhinoceros is covered in animated chains that grasp
    at its enemies. It doesn't gain the grappled condition when using its chains to
    grapple enemies, and can maintain a grapple using its chains as a free action,
    though doing so prevents it from attacking with that chain. An iron rhinoceros
    may have up to two creatures grappled in its chains at a time. Additionally, the
    chains seek to ensnare creatures the rhino tramples. The chains entangle any creature
    that fails its saving throw against the rhinoceros's trample attack, or that chooses
    to forgo its save in order to make an attack of opportunity against the rhinoceros.
    An entangled creature can escape from the chains as a standard action by succeeding
    on a DC 26 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check. Each chain has AC 12,
    hardness 10, and 15 hit points. Creatures entangled in the chains can't move farther
    than 20 feet away from the rhinoceros. If the rhinoceros moves farther than 20
    feet from an entangled target, the tethering chain breaks, but the target remains
    entangled.
  Powerful Drag (Ex): An iron rhinoceros can use the dragAPG combat maneuver to savagely
    scrape its foes across the ground. As a full-round action, an iron rhinoceros
    can attempt a single drag combat maneuver against every creature currently tethered
    to its grasping chains. This deals 1d6 points of damage for every 5 feet dragged,
    and the chains tethered to any creature more than 20 feet away break. The dragging
    damage may increase depending on the terrain, at the GM's discretion. Creatures
    dragged any distance are knocked prone.
  Scooping Charge (Ex): An iron rhinoceros can unhinge its snout in order to scoop
    enemies into the furnace-like cavity within its belly. When making a powerful
    charge, the iron rhinoceros can forgo dealing damage in order to gain the grab
    and fast swallow abilities with its gore attack. The rhinoceros must make this
    choice at the beginning of its charge.
  Swallow Whole (Ex): An iron rhinoceros's belly functions as a furnace, dealing 2d6
    points of fire damage to swallowed creatures. Hatches on the rhinoceros's sides
    allow it to swallow creatures grappled in its chains. In order to take swallowed
    creatures prisoner without dealing fire damage, the rhinoceros can suppress (or
    activate) the flames within its furnace as a swift action. When the rhinoceros
    is suppressing the flames, the furnace instead fills with smoke, forcing swallowed
    creatures to succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save each round or be sickened for as
    long as they remain in the rhinoceros's belly. This save DC is Constitutionbased.
    Creatures attempting to cut their way out of the iron rhinoceros's belly must
    overcome the durability of the thick furnace walls (hardness 10).
desc_long: |-
  The brutality of fire giants is matched only by their ingenuity at crafting devices of war. Of all their creations, however, few match the ruthless efficiency or raw power of the iron rhinoceros. Built to sate the fire giants' endless desire for slaves, iron rhinoceroses serve as both tireless mounts for giant warlords campaigning against lesser races and as temporary prisons for troublesome captives.

  An iron rhinoceros measures 18 feet long from snout to tail and stands 12 feet tall at the shoulder.

### Special Abilities

**Grasping Chains (Ex)** An _[[monsters/Iron Rhinoceros|iron rhinoceros]]_ is covered in _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Animated|animated]]_ chains that _[[spells/Grasp|grasp]]_ at its enemies. It doesn’t gain the _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ condition when using its chains to grapple enemies, and can maintain a grapple using its chains as a free action, though doing so prevents it from attacking with that chain. An _iron rhinoceros_ may have up to two creatures _grappled_ in its chains at a time. Additionally, the chains seek to ensnare creatures the rhino tramples. The chains _[[spells/Entangle|entangle]]_ any creature that fails its saving throw against the _rhinoceros_’s _trample_ attack, or that chooses to forgo its save in order to make an attack of opportunity against the _rhinoceros_. An _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_ creature can escape from the chains as a standard action by succeeding on a DC 26 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check. Each chain has AC 12, hardness 10, and 15 hit points. Creatures _entangled_ in the chains can’t move farther than 20 feet away from the _rhinoceros_. If the _rhinoceros_ moves farther than 20 feet from an _entangled_ target, the tethering chain breaks, but the target remains _entangled_.

**Powerful Drag (Ex)** An _iron rhinoceros_ can use the drag combat maneuver to savagely scrape its foes across the ground. As a full-round action, an _iron rhinoceros_ can attempt a single drag combat maneuver against every creature currently tethered to its grasping chains. This deals 1d6 points of damage for every 5 feet dragged, and the chains tethered to any creature more than 20 feet away break. The dragging damage may increase depending on the terrain, at the GM’s discretion. Creatures dragged any distance are knocked _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_.
**Scooping Charge (Ex)** An _iron rhinoceros_ can unhinge its snout in order to _[[spells/Scoop|scoop]]_ enemies into the furnace-like cavity within its belly. When making a _powerful charge_, the _iron rhinoceros_ can forgo dealing damage in order to gain the _grab_ and _[[universal monster rules/Fast Swallow|fast swallow]]_ abilities with its gore attack. The _rhinoceros_ must make this choice at the beginning of its charge.
**_Swallow Whole_ (Ex)** An _iron rhinoceros_’s belly functions as a furnace, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage to swallowed creatures. Hatches on the _rhinoceros_’s sides allow it to swallow creatures _grappled_ in its chains. In order to take swallowed creatures prisoner without dealing fire damage, the _rhinoceros_ can suppress (or activate) the flames within its furnace as a swift action. When the _rhinoceros_ is suppressing the flames, the furnace instead fills with smoke, forcing swallowed creatures to succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save each round or be _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ for as long as they remain in the _rhinoceros_’s belly. This save DC is Constitutionbased. Creatures attempting to cut their way out of the _iron rhinoceros_’s belly must overcome the durability of the thick furnace walls (hardness 10).
