  Pseudowyverns are distant relatives of wyverns, and while they are much smaller than their infamous cousins, they share many traits, including vicious tempers. These twolegged dragons sleep during the day and are most active in the twilight hours. They are voracious creatures, mainly hunting mammals, birds, and lizards of their own size, but sometimes attacking larger creatures such as goats and sheep. Pseudowyverns hardly ever kill people for food, but they sometimes attack intelligent creatures whose jewelry and other precious items they want to steal and hoard in their nests.

   Pseudowyverns speak Draconic crudely, employing a series of screeches that even other dragons find jarring to hear. Thankfully, they are rarely talkative unless there is food, treasure, or danger nearby. 

   In some lands, nobles and wealthy merchants value pseudowyverns as exotic pets, and one of their eggs can fetch as much as 1,200 gp in some markets. In truth, these illtempered and stubborn creatures make poor pets; keeping them happy requires no small amount of flattery, delicious foods, and shiny things as bribes. Hard to please, they are likely to attack their owners and try to escape unless kept on a very short leash or managed by a skilled handler.

   A 7th-level spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can gain a pseudowyvern as a familiar. A pseudowyvern is about 1 foot long with a 2-foot-long tail, has scales in shades of deep blue, and weighs about 15 pounds.

##### Description

Pseudowyverns are distant relatives of wyverns, and while they are much smaller than their infamous cousins, they share many traits, including _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_ tempers. These twolegged dragons sleep during the day and are most active in the twilight hours. They are voracious creatures, mainly hunting mammals, birds, and lizards of their own size, but sometimes attacking larger creatures such as goats and sheep. Pseudowyverns hardly ever kill people for food, but they sometimes attack intelligent creatures whose _[[items/Mundane/Jewelry|jewelry]]_ and other precious items they want to steal and hoard in their nests.

Pseudowyverns speak Draconic crudely, employing a series of screeches that even other dragons find _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Jarring|jarring]]_ to hear. Thankfully, they are rarely talkative unless there is food, treasure, or danger nearby.

In some lands, nobles and wealthy merchants value pseudowyverns as exotic pets, and one of their eggs can fetch as much as 1,200 gp in some markets. In truth, these illtempered and stubborn creatures make poor pets; keeping them happy requires no small amount of flattery, delicious foods, and shiny things as bribes. Hard to please, they are likely to attack their owners and try to escape unless kept on a very short leash or managed by a skilled handler.

A 7th-level spellcaster with the _[[feats/Improved Familiar|Improved Familiar]]_ feat can gain a _[[monsters/Pseudowyvern|pseudowyvern]]_ as a familiar. A _pseudowyvern_ is about 1 foot long with a 2-foot-long tail, has scales in _[[spells/Shades|shades]]_ of deep blue, and weighs about 15 pounds.
