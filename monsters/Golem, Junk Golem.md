special_abilities:
  Discorporate (Ex): A junk golem can break apart into its constituent pieces as a
    standard action, becoming a swarming mass of Tiny parts. It gains the swarm subtype,
    its space changes to 10 feet, and its reach changes to 0. In this form, it gains
    a swarm attack that deals 1d6 points of damage and inflicts disease, but loses
    its slam attacks. It can revert back to its normal form as a full-round action.
  Disease (Ex): 'Tetanus: Slam-injury; save Fort DC 12; onset 1d6 days; frequency
    1 day; effect 1d4 Dex damage. Each time someone takes Dexterity damage from tetanus,
    there's a 50% chance his jaw muscles stiffen, preventing speech and the use of
    spells with verbal components for 24 hours; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save
    DC is Constitution-based.'
  Immunity to Magic (Ex): A junk golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability
    that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
    differently against a junk golem, as noted below. A shatter spell causes a junk
    golem to discorporate and dazes it for 1 round.A grease spell affects the junk
    golem as if it were haste for 1d6 rounds and ends any slow effect on it.An arcane
    lock or hold portal spell affects the junk golem as if it were a slow spell for
    1d6 rounds and breaks any haste effect on it.A wood shape or rusting grasp spell
    deals 2d6 points of damage to a junk golem.
  Junk Repair (Su): A junk golem has fast healing 2 when in an area with a high concentration
    of debris, such as a refuse heap or the area created by another junk golem's discorporate
    ability.
desc_long: Junk golems are assembled from trash and spare parts, and often leave trails
  of garbage in their wakes.
