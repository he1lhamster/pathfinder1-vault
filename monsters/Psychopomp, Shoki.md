### Special Abilities
**Soul Lock (Su)** Once per day as a standard action, a shoki can use its +2 cold iron _quarterstaff_ to capture the soul of a creature at the threshold of death—any undead creature or any living being with 0 or fewer hit points. The target must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be slain (if living) or disrupted (if undead), its spirit locked within the shoki’s staff. A corporeal undead transforms into a corpse if affected by this ability, while an _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ undead is trapped bodily within the staff (this ability negates a _[[monsters/Ghost|ghost]]_’s ability to rejuvenate). A spirit trapped within a shoki’s staff cannot be returned to life through any means short of _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_, _[[spells/True Resurrection|true resurrection]]_, or _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_. A trapped soul can be freed if the shoki wills it, or by casting _[[spells/Banishment|banishment]]_, _[[spells/Dismissal|dismissal]]_, or _[[spells/Freedom|freedom]]_ upon the staff. The trapped soul can also be freed by destroying the staff. A shoki’s staff can contain only one soul at a time. The save DC is Wisdom-based.

##### Description

Shokis are the collectors of lingering souls, tasked with compelling even the most deluded beings to take the first step into the afterlife. Their tactics are varied, but most start by counseling the wayward dead using theosophical arguments and blunt warnings about the _[[curses/Ravenous|ravenous]]_ things that wait to feed upon lost spirits. Each shoki bears powerful tools to aid it in such pursuits—_[[feats/Eclectic|eclectic]]_ collections of holy symbols and withered staves of cold iron capable of imprisoning a single soul at a time. Shokis use their staves against only the most stubborn or demented souls, whom they capture and personally escort to the Boneyard for judgment.
