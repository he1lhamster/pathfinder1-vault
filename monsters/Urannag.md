### Special Abilities

**Encage (Ex)** As a swift action, an _[[monsters/Urannag|urannag]]_ can encage a

creature that shares its space and is not aware of it or

a _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ creature it has entrapped. The target treats

the _urannag_’s space as difficult terrain, and cannot

move out of that space unless it succeeds at a DC 22

Reflex save. Each round a creature remains encaged,

it takes 2d6 points of slashing damage. A creature

can try to escape by attempting a combat maneuver

check or Escape Artist check (DC = the _urannag_’s CMD)

as a full-round action, or it can try to _[[feats/Smash|smash]]_ through a

cage wall. These walls have an Armor Class of 22,

hardness 10, and 22 hit points. A wall with a

hole smashed in it automatically repairs itself.

The save DC is Strength-based.

**Exposed Mechanisms (Ex)** Although an

_urannag_ is a construct, it can be harmed

by the methods used to disable traps.

A successful DC 20 Disable Device check

targeting an _urannag_ (a full-round action that

provokes an attack of opportunity) deals damage that bypasses

the _urannag_’s DR equal to 3d6 + the character’s total ranks in

Disable Device. Additionally, the _urannag_ is _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1

round (DC 16 Fortitude negates the _staggered_ condition).

**Living Trap (Ex)** Defensive abilities that apply to traps (such as

trap sense) apply against an _urannag_’s attacks.

##### Description

Urannags have long vexed scholars, some of whom contend

that they’re creatures, while others argue that they’re complex

traps. In truth, they’re both—an unsettling example of how

reality on the Abyss doesn’t match mortal expectations. An

_urannag_ behaves like an ambush predator, yet has no need for

sustenance and is driven to f lense prey out of innate sadism.
