desc_short: A delicate-looking creature floats silently in midair. Resembling a large
  jellyfish, it has a fringe of bird's feathers around its quivering central mass
  and long tentacles trailing from its center, with each tentacle ending in a snapping
  beak. It sings to itself as it flies, each beak making a different note in an eerie
  harmony.

  Skrik nettles range in size from a few inches across (for a newly spawned hatchling) to the size of gigantic, scintillating clouds. Most, however, are no more than 8 or 9 feet across.

# Spark Nettle
A delicate-looking creature floats silently in midair. Resembling a large jellyfish, it has a fringe of bird’s feathers around its quivering central mass and long tentacles trailing from its center, with each tentacle ending in a snapping beak. It sings to itself as it flies, each beak making a different note in an eerie harmony.

##### Description

Shoals of skrik nettles float through the skies of the First World. They sail like boats, driven before the wind and using their feathers to tack and turn. They sing as they fly, jabbering and chirping to each other in complex harmonies. The average skrik nettle shoal consists of three dozen or more of the majestic creatures, but these flocks are often _[[universal monster rules/Split|split]]_ up during the roaring storms so common to the First World. Lone skrik nettles may be encountered in smaller numbers, _[[conditions/Confused|confused]]_ and trying to find their way back to their kin.

Skrik nettles range in size from a few inches across (for a newly spawned hatchling) to the size of gigantic, scintillating clouds. Most, however, are no more than 8 or 9 feet across.
