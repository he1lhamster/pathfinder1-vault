  Touch of Madness (Su): The touch of an aoandon causes maddening fear. As a standard

    creature damaged by an aoandon's touch attack must succeed at a DC 24 Will save
    or be confused for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at this saving throw can't
    be confused again by this aoandon's touch of madness for 10 minutes. This is a

desc_long: An aoandon is an incorporeal outsider formed from the spirit of a woman
  who died pursuing some ill-fated relationship. An aoandon waits for her chance to
  seek revenge on those who wronged her in her mortal life. If that person is dead,
  she finds a surrogate-someone who reminds her of the wrongdoer-and acts out her
  delusions with unrelenting vindictiveness. These spirits can also appear as a result
  of mishaps with calling spells, but such instances are rare.
