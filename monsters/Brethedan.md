special_abilities:
  Adaptation (Ex): A brethedan's body is extremely mutable, and can adapt to respond
    to virtually any situation. Once per round as a swift action that does not provoke
    attacks of opportunity, a brethedan can reshape its body and chemistry to adopt
    any of the following qualities. It gains resistance 5 against a single energy
    type (acid, cold, electricity, or fire).It gains an additional natural attack
    (bite, tentacle, etc.) with damage appropriate to its size.Its slam damage type
    changes to slashing or piercing.Its slam damage die increases by one step (from
    1d6 to 1d8 for most brethedans).It gains a +4 natural armor bonus to AC.Its reach
    increases to 20 feet. A brethedan can only have one modification in effect at
    any one time-if it selects a new adaptation, it loses any other in effect. More
    extreme adaptations are also possible (at the GM's discretion), but generally
    take days or even months to adopt.
  Combine (Ex): Thanks to their perfect communication, brethedans can combine to work
    together as parts of a larger organism. As a swift action, a brethedan adjacent
    to another can merge with it, becoming a single creature occupying both spaces.
    The merging brethedan forfeits its actions to augment the other, and adds its
    hit points (though not its Hit Dice) to the new creature's collective total. At
    this time, it also chooses one adaptation-the combined creature gains this benefit,
    and it cannot be changed unless the combined creature uses its single adaptation
    action each round to do so. Any number of brethedans can merge in this fashion,
    but each adaptation can be gained only once (though resistances to multiple energy
    types are allowed). The combined creature retains the ability to swap one adaptation
    each round (not once per component creature). Splitting into the component creatures
    again is a full-round action in which all component creatures are released and
    the remaining hit points are divided evenly. For the purposes of Hit Die-related
    effects, the Hit Dice of a combined brethedan are equal to those of the component
    creature with the highest CR.
desc_long: Brethedans are an adaptive race of floating, telepathic creatures that
  live on gas giant worlds. Though highly intelligent, they disdain physical tools,
  likely because of the lack of raw materials available in the clouds of their vast
  homes. Instead, brethedans have evolved to solve problems by combining and modifying
  their bodies or producing tailored biological agents inside themselves. Though humanoids
  rarely understand the placid race's obscure and alien goals, brethedans do sometimes
  travel to and even colonize other gaseous worlds, and are believed to be the first
  creatures to have tamed oma for use as living spaceships. A typical Brethedan is
  10 feet long and weighs 200 pounds.
