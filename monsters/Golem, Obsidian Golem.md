  Death Throes (Ex): When an obsidian golem is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it

    results in half damage and negates the bleed effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Immunity to Magic (Ex): An obsidian golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability
    that allows spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently
    against the creature, as noted below. • A magical attack that deals fire damage
    sharpens the obsidian golem's claws, increasing their critical threat range to
    18-20 and increasing bleed damage to 3d6 for 1d4+1 rounds. • A magical attack
    that deals cold damage cakes ice over the obsidian golem's form, suppressing the
    bleed damage from its claw attacks and negating its jagged body ability for 1
    round. • A stone to flesh spell negates the golem's damage reduction, jagged body,
    and immunity to magic for 1 full round.
  Jagged Body (Ex): A creature that grapples an obsidian golem or that hits it with
    a natural attack or unarmed strike takes 2d6 points of bleed damage.
  Obsidian Spray (Ex): As a swift action every 1d4+1 rounds, an obsidian golem can
    unleash a torrent of obsidian shards, filling a 30-foot cone. Creatures caught
    in this attack take 8d6 points of piercing and slashing damage and 2d6 points
    of bleed damage. A DC 18 Reflex save reduces this damage by half and negates the
    bleed effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: Obsidian golems often are used as deterrence against tomb robbers. Most
  obsidian golems stand just under 9 feet tall and weigh approximately 2,200 pounds.
