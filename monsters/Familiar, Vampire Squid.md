    cloud of blue light must succeed at a DC 11 Fortitude save or be dazzled for as

  Pressure Adaptation (Ex): A vampire squid takes no pressure damage from changes
    in water depth.
  Tentacles (Ex): A vampire squid's tentacles all strike as a single primary attack
    but only to grapple.

  The vampire squid-so called for its red eyes and cloak-like webbing-is a cephalopod from the lightless depths of the oceans. This eerie mollusk is covered in photophores, which it can use to create a defensive barrage of light when agitated.

   A vampire squid can reach a total body length of up to 1 foot and weighs 1 pound.
