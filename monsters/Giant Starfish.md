  Firm Grip (Ex): The giant starfish excels at grappling prey, and gains a +8 racial
    bonus on grapple checks (rather than the standard +4 bonus most monsters gain
    as a result of having the grab ability).
  Slow Regeneration (Ex): A giant starfish has regeneration but heals very slowly,
    regaining a number of hit points each hour equal to its Hit Dice (11 hp per hour
    for the typical giant starfish). Acid, cold, or fire damage suppresses this regeneration
    for 24 hours.
  Stomach (Ex): The giant starfish can invert its stomach to attack prey up to 20
    feet away. The hook-lined opening to the starfish's stomach is a primary attack
    that deals piercing damage. If a giant starfish successfully grapples a foe with
    its stomach, it gains the benefit of the fast swallow universal monster rule and
    can swallow the target immediately rather than waiting until the start of its
    next turn. It does not trigger a fast swallow effect if it grapples a foe with
    a slam attack.
desc_long: |-
  The giant starfish dwells along coastlines and in other shallow marine areas. The undersides of each of the giant starfish's arms are lined with thousands of small tube feet that propel it along and aid in grappling and pinning its prey. The tube feet at the end of the arms are also sensory organs, detecting scents and textures. The starfish moves via a water vascular system, drawing in ocean water and pumping the water throughout its body and out to its tube feet. Because of this, the giant starfish is highly dependent on water to remain mobile and alive. 

  The giant starfish can be an active hunter, relentlessly attacking marine mammals and coastal avian life alike, but just as often it lies in wait along the water's edge for its prey to venture into reach. When attacking, the giant starfish latches on with up to three of its arms and attempts to pin its opponent. It then extends its stomach outside of its inner cavity in order to begin digesting the pinned or grappled creature. The giant starfish's stomach can also shoot out as an elongated tubelike stalk to strike potential prey up to 20 feet away. When the series of barbed hooks at the end of the stomach stalk catch the targeted creature, the starfish begins to pull it closer, in order to more thoroughly secure its meal with its multiple arms. A giant starfish can have anywhere from five to 24 arms, and while the total number of arms can result in a wildly differentlooking creature, the number of limbs has no effect on its statistics since a giant starfish of any size can attack with only up to three of its limbs at a time. 

  A giant starfish typically measures 15 feet in diameter and weighs 800 pounds.

##### Description

The _giant starfish_ dwells along coastlines and in other shallow marine areas. The undersides of each of the _giant starfish_’s arms are lined with thousands of small tube feet that propel it along and aid in grappling and pinning its prey. The tube feet at the end of the arms are also sensory organs, detecting scents and textures. The starfish moves via a water vascular system, drawing in ocean water and pumping the water throughout its body and out to its tube feet. Because of this, the _giant starfish_ is highly dependent on water to remain mobile and alive.

The _giant starfish_ can be an active _[[classes/Hunter|hunter]]_, relentlessly attacking marine mammals and coastal avian life alike, but just as often it lies in wait along the water’s edge for its prey to venture into reach. When attacking, the _giant starfish_ latches on with up to three of its arms and attempts to pin its opponent. It then extends its stomach outside of its inner cavity in order to begin digesting the _[[conditions/Pinned|pinned]]_ or _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ creature. The _giant starfish_’s stomach can also shoot out as an elongated tubelike stalk to strike potential prey up to 20 feet away. When the series of barbed hooks at the end of the stomach stalk catch the targeted creature, the starfish begins to _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ it closer, in order to more thoroughly secure its meal with its multiple arms. A _giant starfish_ can have anywhere from five to 24 arms, and while the total number of arms can result in a wildly differentlooking creature, the number of limbs has no effect on its statistics since a _giant starfish_ of any size can attack with only up to three of its limbs at a time.
