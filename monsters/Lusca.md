### Special Abilities

**Poison (Ex)** _Constrict_—injury; save Fort DC 28; frequency 1/

round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves.

**_Rend_ Ship (Ex)** As a full-round action, a _[[monsters/Lusca|lusca]]_ can attempt

to use four of its tentacles to grapple a ship of its size or

smaller by attempting a combat maneuver check opposed

by the ship captain’s Profession (sailor) check; the _lusca_

receives a cumulative +4 bonus on the check for each

size category smaller than Gargantuan the ship is. If the

_lusca_ grapples the ship, it holds the ship motionless; it

can attack targets anywhere on or within the ship with its

remaining four tentacles, but can’t attack foes at all with its

_[[monsters/Shark|shark]]_ heads. Each round it maintains its hold on the ship,

it automatically deals bite damage from all three heads to

the ship’s hull.

**_Vicious_ Grapple (Ex)** A _lusca_ does not gain the _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_

condition if it grabs a foe with its tentacles. It can attempt

to maintain a grapple against any number of creatures in its

tentacles as a swift action.

##### Description

Luscas are among the most feared predators in the

open ocean—their snapping _shark_ heads and writhing

tentacles spell the end for many crews. A _lusca_’s presence

can first be felt in the air, as its body naturally conducts

electricity. Sailors who have encountered the being

and survived claim that thunderclouds seem to roll

in alongside the creature and strange electrical f ires

dance in the air before it attacks, lending an eerie aura

of foreboding to the oncoming assault. _[[curses/Ravenous|Ravenous]]_ and

unpredictable, a _lusca_ claims wide swaths of territory

in order to maximize the number of ships it can sink

and crews it can feast upon; luscas brook no other large

predators in their claimed territory, and battle even

mighty krakens for control. They are equally territorial

with their own kind, and an encounter between two

luscas, except to mate, almost always ends with one dead or

driven off. While luscas prefer to make quick meals of the

sailors onboard a ship, they will eat just about any aquatic

creature, and even giant octopuses and whales know to

steer clear of a hungry _lusca_’s vicinity.

The average _lusca_ is 90 feet from tentacle to snout and

weighs 3,800 pounds. Legends tell of even larger luscas

that can sink Colossal ships.
