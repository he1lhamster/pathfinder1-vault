    damage (DC 23 Reflex for half). Any creature that takes damage from this electricity
    must also make a DC 23 Fortitude save to avoid being staggered for 1d4 rounds.
  Poison (Ex): Tentacle-injury; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect
    1d4 Dex and 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: Like other giant jellyfish, a sapphire jellyfish is an active hunter. It
  stores powerful electrical charges in its domelike bell, which is 16 feet in diameter.
  Its sensory tentacles can trail for twice that length, but the dangerous toxic tentacles
  are positioned within about 20 feet of the creature's bell.
