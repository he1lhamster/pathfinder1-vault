  There is a common myth among many far-f lung tribesof a great and regal bird who comes sometimes withprophecy and other times as a savior for a great hero.These majestic creatures are both stern and benevolent,using their power to scatter a tribe's foes or to herald greateras of prosperity. To benefit from the being's attention,the leaders of the tribe must acquiesce to the bird'sdemands, which typically include accomplishing somedifficult quest to which the bird's enigmatic propheciesallude. While sometimes these radiant messengers arephoenixes, occasionally they are a rarer sort of prophet-majestic birdlike creatures from the Positive EnergyPlane known as turuls.

  Turuls often treat the Material Plane as a huntingground, where they might feed upon wild beasts or huntundead and other creatures that wantonly spread mayhem.Such hunters keep to themselves, avoiding other creatures,but other turuls take a more active role with peaceful,intelligent creatures. While a few turuls go so far as toportray themselves as deities, granting protection andhealing in return for worship, most of these magnificentoutsiders watch from a distance, treating their chosentribe more like pets, meddling only when their favoritesare threatened or in the midst of dire circumstances.

  While many turuls enjoy their forays on the MaterialPlane, the massive avians are intrinsically tied to the PositiveEnergy Plane. They also seem to be somehow related to thejyoti-another race of avian natives of the Positive EnergyPlane-though neither turuls nor jyoti care to divulgethe true nature of the relationship. Some scholars of theouter planes suggest that the two avian species are actuallyincarnations of the same genesis, while others postulatethat turuls are some higher form of jyoti within a cycleof reincarnation intrinsic to many of the Positive EnergyPlane's denizens. Both theories are mere speculation.

  Unlike the more social jyoti, turuls tend to be loners.They keep company for short periods of time, either to mateor purely for the enjoyment of one another's company, butsuch couplings last for a few decades at most. Instead ofdwelling in crystalline cities like the jyoti, turuls roost atthe tops of tree-shaped gemstone formations that spring upfrom the landscape of their home plane. Turuls are haughtybut talkative and sometimes welcome visitors. They perchsilently upon their crystal trees, taking time to speak to anywho approach them, so long as they find the conversationworthwhile. As soon as they lose interest, they politelydismiss themselves or their guests. Those who don't leaveare typically met with scorn if not aggression. Turuls arenot used to or fond of being ignored or insulted.

  In stark contrast to the jyoti, the turuls hold no hatredor ill will toward deities and their servants, at least whenthey encounter such creatures on planes other than thePositive Energy Plane. While on the Material Plane,turuls will even work with good- and neutral-alignedoutsiders to protect their hunting grounds and adoptedhumanoid communities.

  In rare circumstances, a turul dwells at the heart of ajyoti crystal city, supervising these settlements from atoptheir eyries as ever-vigilant protectors. Those who dobecome more like the jyoti over time, and treat outsiderswith the same anger and vehemence as their wards.Such arrangements are typically short-lived, though.Turuls who live with jyoti only do so for a century atmost, and when they leave, their personalities andrelations with others revert to a more calmand contemplative manner. Such mighthint at some arrangement wherein aturul agrees to become part of ajyoti community, living by theirrules for a period in return forsomething the turul covets-such as mystical knowledge,information about egress to theMaterial Plane, or possibly one ofthe artifacts that the jyoti hoard.

  The most consistent relationship the turuls have iswith phoenixes. Those fiery avians often treat turulslike royalty and willingly serve them, whether or notthe turul has expressed any interest in gaining af laming entourage. Though, for all their impatiencewith other creatures, turuls tolerate the presence ofphoenixes better than they do others.

  Part of turuls' legendary moodiness stems from thesame myths for which they're best known-thosewherein they bring prophecies of light and peace.On some Material Plane worlds, such tales are sopervasive that mortal heroes go as far as venturingto the Positive Energy Plane to seek blessingsand wisdom from turuls. The great avians havelittle patience for those who presume upon theiroccasional benevolence. Not only that, but a turul'sprophecies are not merely boons to be meted out.Rather, their promises of peace and prosperity typicallycome about via changes they've affected using their ownconsiderable power, or as inevitabilities they've had theforesight to predict. In the rarest of cases, some turulsclaim to have communed with the power of the deepestPositive Energy Plane and that they serve as messengers ofthat mysterious cosmic will. Whether or not such is truefew can know, but that possibility has certainly inf luencedthe greatest variety of mortal myths regarding turuls.

  Gigantic in stature, turuls stand nearly 30 feet tall andhave a wingspan of almost 50 feet. They weigh upwards of15 tons. While they reside on the Positive Energy Plane,turuls are effectively immortal. They age only whentraveling from their home plane.

##### Description

There is a common myth among many far-f lung tribes

of a great and regal bird who comes sometimes with

prophecy and other times as a savior for a great hero.

These majestic creatures are both stern and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Benevolent|benevolent]]_,

using their power to scatter a tribe’s foes or to herald great

eras of prosperity. To benefit from the being’s attention,

the leaders of the tribe must acquiesce to the bird’s

demands, which typically include accomplishing some

difficult quest to which the bird’s enigmatic prophecies

allude. While sometimes these _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Radiant|radiant]]_ messengers are

phoenixes, occasionally they are a rarer sort of _[[feats/Prophet|prophet]]_—

majestic birdlike creatures from the Positive Energy

Plane known as turuls.

Turuls often treat the Material Plane as a hunting

ground, where they might feed upon wild beasts or hunt

undead and other creatures that wantonly spread mayhem.

Such hunters keep to themselves, avoiding other creatures,

but other turuls take a more active role with _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Peaceful|peaceful]]_,

intelligent creatures. While a few turuls go so far as to

portray themselves as deities, granting protection and

healing in return for worship, most of these magnificent

outsiders watch from a distance, treating their chosen

tribe more like pets, meddling only when their favorites

are threatened or in the midst of dire circumstances.

While many turuls enjoy their forays on the Material

Plane, the massive avians are intrinsically tied to the Positive

Energy Plane. They also seem to be somehow related to the

_[[monsters/Jyoti|jyoti]]_—another race of avian natives of the Positive Energy

Plane—though neither turuls nor _jyoti_ care to divulge

the true nature of the relationship. Some scholars of the

outer planes suggest that the two avian species are actually

incarnations of the same genesis, while others postulate

that turuls are some higher form of _jyoti_ within a cycle

of reincarnation intrinsic to many of the Positive Energy

Plane’s denizens. Both theories are mere speculation.

Unlike the more social _jyoti_, turuls tend to be loners.

They keep company for short periods of time, either to mate

or purely for the enjoyment of one another’s company, but

such couplings last for a few decades at most. Instead of

dwelling in crystalline cities like the _jyoti_, turuls roost at

the tops of tree-shaped gemstone formations that spring up

from the landscape of their home plane. Turuls are haughty

but talkative and sometimes welcome visitors. They perch

silently upon their crystal trees, taking time to speak to any

who approach them, so long as they find the conversation

worthwhile. As soon as they lose interest, they politely

dismiss themselves or their guests. Those who don’t leave

are typically met with scorn if not aggression. Turuls are

not used to or fond of being ignored or insulted.

In stark contrast to the _jyoti_, the turuls hold no hatred

or ill will toward deities and their servants, at least when

they encounter such creatures on planes other than the

Positive Energy Plane. While on the Material Plane,

turuls will even work with good- and neutral-aligned

outsiders to protect their hunting grounds and adopted

humanoid communities.

In rare circumstances, a _turul_ dwells at the heart of a

_jyoti_ crystal city, supervising these settlements from atop

their eyries as ever-vigilant protectors. Those who do

become more like the _jyoti_ over time, and treat outsiders

with the same anger and vehemence as their wards.

Such arrangements are typically short-lived, though.

Turuls who live with _jyoti_ only do so for a century at

most, and when they leave, their personalities and

relations with others revert to a more calm

and _[[monsters/Contemplative|contemplative]]_ manner. Such might

hint at some arrangement wherein a

_turul_ agrees to become part of a

_jyoti_ community, living by their

rules for a period in return for

something the _turul_ covets—

such as mystical knowledge,

information about egress to the

Material Plane, or possibly one of

the artifacts that the _jyoti_ hoard.

The most consistent relationship the turuls have is

with phoenixes. Those fiery avians often treat turuls

like royalty and willingly serve them, whether or not

the _turul_ has expressed any interest in gaining a

f laming entourage. Though, for all their impatience

with other creatures, turuls tolerate the presence of

phoenixes better than they do others.

Part of turuls’ legendary moodiness stems from the

same myths for which they’re best known—those

wherein they bring prophecies of light and peace.

On some Material Plane worlds, such tales are so

pervasive that mortal heroes go as far as venturing

to the Positive Energy Plane to seek blessings

and wisdom from turuls. The great avians have

little patience for those who presume upon their

occasional benevolence. Not only that, but a _turul_’s

prophecies are not merely boons to be meted out.

Rather, their promises of peace and prosperity typically

come about via changes they’ve affected using their own

considerable power, or as inevitabilities they’ve had the

_[[spells/Foresight|foresight]]_ to predict. In the rarest of cases, some turuls

claim to have communed with the power of the deepest

Positive Energy Plane and that they serve as messengers of

that mysterious cosmic will. Whether or not such is true

few can know, but that possibility has certainly inf luenced

the greatest variety of mortal myths regarding turuls.

Gigantic in stature, turuls stand nearly 30 feet tall and

have a wingspan of almost 50 feet. They weigh upwards of

15 tons. While they reside on the Positive Energy Plane,

turuls are effectively immortal. They age only when

traveling from their home plane.
