### Special Abilities

**Deep Dweller (Ex)** Deep

_[[monsters/Merfolk|merfolk]]_ are immune

to damage from water

pressure; their bodies

adjust instantly to different

depths.
**Semitransparent (Ex)** _[[monsters/Deep Merfolk|Deep merfolk]]_

are very difficult to spot while they are

_underwater_. So long as they are at least

10 feet _underwater_, _deep merfolk_ gain

concealment and can use the Stealth skill while

moving at their normal speed without penalty.

In the ocean depths (about 3,000 feet deep or

more), this benefit improves to total concealment.
**Sprint (Ex)** A _deep merfolk_ can charge or withdraw

at up to 3 times its swim speed.

##### Description

Much like common _merfolk_, _deep merfolk_ have

humanoid upper bodies and fish-like tails, but they

are adapted for survival within the depths of the ocean.

Their skin is both dark and transparent to help them _[[spells/Blend|blend]]_

with the sunless ocean depths. They sometimes adorn

themselves with bioluminescent dye to create glowing spots

on the skin along their tails, which they use both as a form

of silent communication and to lure in prey when they hunt.

_Deep merfolk_ build villages along the sides of the deepest

ocean trenches, where they hunt sea creatures and gather

crustaceans from the ocean f loor. They are capable hunters,

and small hunting groups of _deep merfolk_ have been

known to take down sharks or other large creatures _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Stalking|stalking]]_

the depths. When hunting, _deep merfolk_ prefer to ambush

their prey, often luring targets in with bioluminescence.

They rely on their camouf lage to hide within the crevices

and cold sand until their traps can be sprung.

Like their cousins, _deep merfolk_ are highly protective

of their tribes and homes and go to great lengths to

keep strangers away. Spellcasters among their

tribes often use illusions to hide _deep merfolk_

dwellings, while rangers and hunters set up

traps, ambushes, and false trails that lead

interlopers into distant and dangerous areas

of the deep ocean. If such _[[spells/Misdirection|misdirection]]_ and

illusion fail, _deep merfolk_ don’t hesitate

to launch proactive attacks against

intruders—at a fair distance away

from their homes if possible.

While their appearance has led

to legends of ties to dark powers

and sinister agendas, most deep

_merfolk_ are simple folk with

little interest in the world above

the waves. A few secretive tribes

worship the demon lord Dagon,

but they view him as a dark

protector they must appease,

not a deity to emulate or

for whom they feel

any affection.
