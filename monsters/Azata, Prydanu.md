special_abilities:
  Burst of Restoration (Su): Once per day as a standard action, a prydanu can strengthen
    its aura to undo the physical tampering of others. Each creature within its aura
    suffering from a detrimental or unwanted transmutation effect can attempt a new
    saving throw against the effect. This power also works on any afflicted lycanthrope,
    entothrope, or similar creature, granting it a new saving throw to remove its
    affliction. At the GM's discretion, burst of restoration can have a special effect
    on creatures permanently mutated by magic, such as fleshwarps or Mana Waste mutants.
    A creature undergoing this greater effect loses its unwanted acquired templates
    or reverts back to its original form, but it must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude
    saving throw or take 2 permanent negative levels as a result of the sudden and
    dramatic change to its physiology. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Clarity's Grace (Su): A prydanu's aura protects those around it from mind control
    and all forms of deception, both magical and mundane. All allies within her aura
    gain a +4 sacred bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting spells and abilities
    and on Sense Motive skill checks. A prydanu's aura negates illusions. This functions
    as globe of invulnerability, except it can affect only spells or spelllike abilities
    from the illusion school and can affect spells of any spell level.
  Lucid Rain (Su): Once per week as a full-round action, a prydanu can create an area
    of light rain centered on her with a radius of 120 feet that lasts for 10 minutes.
    Any creature touched by the rain that is under the effects of a mind-affecting
    spell or effect can attempt a new saving throw to end those effects. Prydanus
    often use this ability during naturally occurring rainstorms on villages or cities
    they feel may be in trouble.
desc_long: |-
  Prydanus are fierce champions of Elysium who use their talents to undo the work of oppressors by revealing their deception and releasing their victims from bondage. Among the prydanus' most hated foes on Golarion are the alghollthus. Prydanus are drawn to civilizations under the thrall of tyrants. Prydanus do not tolerate such deceptions, and they combat them without hesitation whenever they encounter them. However, this lack of restraint sometimes makes for shortsighted plans of action leading to other consequences along the way.

   Prydanus pride themselves on being guardian figures, and they delight in helping distressed individuals, especially those attempting to escape from any form of subjugation. Given their natural tendency toward vanity, prydanus appreciate (and perhaps even expect) being showered with praise for their good deeds, and those who sufficiently stoke a prydanu's ego may find a returning ally in that azata when future troubles arise.

   Radiant and poised, a prydanu appears as an attractive humanoid with small patches of iridescent scales on its glistening skin. A graceful pair of translucent finlike wings extends from its back, not only allowing it to soar with ease but also granting it impressive agility underwater. Their striking silver eyes are framed with long, feathery lashes and match their metallic-colored nails and lips. A prydanu's hair varies from one individual to another but is usually several shades and decorated with jewels, flowers, shells, or other such adornments.

   A typical prydanu stands 8 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.

##### Description

Prydanus are fierce champions of Elysium who use their talents to undo the work of oppressors by revealing their deception and releasing their victims from bondage. Among the prydanus’ most hated foes on Golarion are the alghollthus. Prydanus are drawn to civilizations under the thrall of tyrants. Prydanus do not tolerate such deceptions, and they combat them without hesitation whenever they encounter them. However, this lack of restraint sometimes makes for shortsighted plans of action leading to other consequences along the way.

Prydanus pride themselves on being _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Guardian|guardian]]_ figures, and they delight in helping distressed individuals, especially those attempting to escape from any form of subjugation. Given their natural tendency toward vanity, prydanus appreciate (and perhaps even expect) being showered with praise for their good deeds, and those who sufficiently stoke a prydanu’s ego may find a returning ally in that azata when future troubles arise.

_[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Radiant|Radiant]]_ and poised, a prydanu appears as an attractive humanoid with small patches of iridescent scales on its glistening skin. A graceful pair of translucent finlike wings extends from its back, not only allowing it to soar with ease but also granting it impressive agility _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_. Their striking silver eyes are framed with long, feathery lashes and match their metallic-colored nails and lips. A prydanu’s hair varies from one individual to another but is usually several _[[spells/Shades|shades]]_ and decorated with jewels, flowers, shells, or other such adornments.

A typical prydanu stands 8 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.
