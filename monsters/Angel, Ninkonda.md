  Nailed Fists (Su): A ninkonda fights with the heavy spikes driven through their
    arms and hands. These attacks are treated as a pair of +4 spiked gauntlets. At
    will as a standard action, a ninkonda can grant these attacks the axiomatic, holy,
    or merciful weapon special ability, but must select the same special ability for
    both hands. Their hands retain the selected special ability until they choose
    another special ability to replace the previous one. These weapons cannot be removed
    or sundered. They fade away when the ninkonda dies and cannot be used by any other
    creature. As a standard action, a ninkonda can fling a volley of four spikes from
    their arms. Make a separate attack roll for each spike-all targets must be within
    30 feet of each other. The spikes have a range increment of 20 feet. The spikes
    are treated as +4 darts with the same weapon special ability as the ninkonda's
    fists. Whether the attacks hit or miss, these spikes immediately disappear and
    reappear back in the ninkonda's body.
  Reflect Rays (Su): Rays and ranged touch effects that strike a ninkonda but fail
    to overcome the angel's spell resistance are reflected back at their source, using
    the original attack roll to determine whether they hit. The ninkonda must be aware
    of the attack and not flat-footed.
  Soul Reflection (Su): A ninkonda can angle the mirror in their chest to reflect
    the weaknesses of creatures' souls. Each round as a swift action, the ninkonda
    can project a 60-foot cone of contrition. All creatures in the cone fall prone
    with grief and remorse, taking no actions for as long as they are within 60 feet
    of the ninkonda (Will DC 25 negates). A lawful creature gains a +4 bonus on this
    saving throw, and a good creature gains a +8 bonus on the saving throw (these
    bonuses stack). Sightless creatures cannot be affected by this ability, nor can
    creatures that cast no reflection (such as vampires). This is a mind-affecting
    compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  Ninkondas, or “nail angels,” are stoic, remorseless hunters of the celestial planes. At a distance, a ninkonda appears to be a winged knight wearing full plate armor. Up close, the creatures present a more intimidating and bizarre appearance: dozens of iron spikes impale their arms, shoulders, and hands, and the faceplates of their helms are smooth and featureless. Ninkondas hunt once-honorable mortals who have committed heinous sins, such as treason against good nations or betrayal of celestial confidences. Ninkondas don't slay their quarry; instead they wordlessly encourage redemption by reflecting the creature's soul in the mirror inset in the angels' broad chests.

  Ninkondas stand 12 feet tall with wingspans of just over 25 feet. They weigh about 1,200 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**Nailed Fists (Su)** A ninkonda fights with the heavy spikes driven through their arms and hands. These attacks are treated as a pair of +4 spiked gauntlets. At will as a standard action, a ninkonda can grant these attacks the _axiomatic_, holy, or _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Merciful|merciful]]_ weapon special ability, but must select the same special ability for both hands. Their hands retain the selected special ability until they choose another special ability to replace the previous one. These weapons cannot be removed or sundered. They fade away when the ninkonda dies and cannot be used by any other creature. As a standard action, a ninkonda can _[[feats/Fling|fling]]_ a volley of four spikes from their arms. Make a separate attack roll for each spike—all targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The spikes have a range increment of 20 feet. The spikes are treated as +4 darts with the same weapon special ability as the ninkonda’s fists. Whether the attacks hit or miss, these spikes immediately disappear and reappear back in the ninkonda’s body.

**Reflect Rays (Su)** Rays and ranged touch effects that strike a ninkonda but fail to overcome the angel’s _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ are reflected back at their source, using the original attack roll to determine whether they hit. The ninkonda must be aware of the attack and not _flat-footed_.
**Soul Reflection (Su)** A ninkonda can angle the _mirror_ in their chest to reflect the weaknesses of creatures’ souls. Each round as a swift action, the ninkonda can project a 60-foot cone of contrition. All creatures in the cone fall _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ with grief and remorse, taking no actions for as long as they are within 60 feet of the ninkonda (Will DC 25 negates). A lawful creature gains a +4 bonus on this saving throw, and a good creature gains a +8 bonus on the saving throw (these bonuses stack). Sightless creatures cannot be affected by this ability, nor can creatures that cast no reflection (such as vampires). This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

##### Description

Ninkondas, or “nail angels,” are _[[feats/Stoic|stoic]]_, remorseless hunters of the celestial planes. At a distance, a ninkonda appears to be a winged _[[npcs/Knight|knight]]_ wearing _[[items/Armor/Full plate|full plate]]_ armor. Up close, the creatures present a more intimidating and bizarre appearance: dozens of iron spikes impale their arms, shoulders, and hands, and the faceplates of their helms are smooth and featureless. Ninkondas hunt once-honorable mortals who have committed heinous sins, such as treason against good nations or betrayal of celestial confidences. Ninkondas don’t slay their quarry; instead they wordlessly encourage _[[feats/Redemption|redemption]]_ by _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Reflecting|reflecting]]_ the creature’s soul in the _mirror_ inset in the angels’ broad chests.

Ninkondas stand 12 feet tall with wingspans of just over 25 feet. They weigh about 1,200 pounds.
