with claws and tentacles and spidery legs.

### Special Abilities

**Feeding Tentacles (Su)** As a

standard action, a _[[monsters/Yangethe|yangethe]]_

can use its mouth tentacles to

feed on a _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ creature or a

creature it is currently grappling. In this

case, if the _yangethe_ hits with a melee touch attack, the

feeding tentacles wrap around the target’s body and riddle

it with thousands of tiny filaments that siphon away the

victim’s emotions. This attack deals 1d4 points of Charisma

drain. The _yangethe_ heals 5 points of damage for every point

of Charisma it drains in this manner. As long as a creature

continues to suffer any of this Charisma drain, each time it

attempts to sleep, it is affected by a _[[spells/Nightmare|nightmare]]_ spell (CL 10th,

DC 20) and has terrifying dreams wherein the experience of

being fed upon by the _yangethe_ takes on greater and greater

levels of horror. All effects from the feeding tentacles are

mind-affecting effects.

**_Psychic_ Blast (Su)** Once per day as a standard action, a

_yangethe_ can emit a blast of _psychic_ energy from its mind in

a 30-foot-radius burst centered on itself. All creatures in this

area take 6d6 points of nonlethal damage from the intense

pain and are _[[conditions/Confused|confused]]_ for 1d6 rounds. A successful DC 18 Will

save halves the damage and negates the _[[spells/Confusion|confusion]]_. This is a

mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

##### Description

One of the countless creatures bred and engineered by

eldritch horrors from beyond the stars, yangethes have, over

the eons, developed _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Keen|keen]]_ intellects and desires of their own.

Unless slain by violence, a _yangethe_ is immortal.
