  Gifts of the Sea (Ex): Once per day as a full-round action, an auwaz couatl can
    bestow a creature within 120 feet with either its blessing or its curse. A blessed

    city, whichever is closer, as find the path. In addition, the blessed creature
    always has favorable winds, which grant the benefits of endure elements and allow
    any ship the creature travels on to move at its fastest speed. A cursed creature
    takes a -6 penalty on Profession (sailor) and Survival checks, and it always has
    strong unfavorable winds that blow in the opposite direction of the cursed creature's
    final destination. A creature affected by this ability remains affected for 12
    hours. A creature can attempt a DC 16 Will save to resist this effect. The save
    DC is Charisma-based.
  Poison (Ex): Injury-bite; save Fortitude DC 17; frequency 1/ minute for 10 minutes;
    effect 1d2 Dex damage; cure 1 save. The DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: Auwaz couatls are a variety of couatl known for helping those who are lost
  find their way back to safety. They are particularly known for traveling around
  the oceans of Golarion to help sailors and other travelers lost at sea. Many sailors
  claim that they owe their lives to an auwaz couatl, though these same sailors warn
  that living a particularly vile life will instead draw an auwaz couatl's ire. An
  auwaz couatl often prefers that evil beings remain lost, and it actively works to
  ensure such creatures remain lost for as long as possible. A typical auwaz couatl
  is 8 feet long with a wingspan of 12 feet, and weighs 800 pounds.
