  Compelling Knock (Su): A waldgeist is preternaturally drawn to the sound of knocking
    on wood. If a waldgeist is within 15 feet of a creature that knocks on a wooden
    object (for example, a tree or an item primarily made of wood, such as a wooden
    shield), it must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or it is compelled to move
    toward the creature for as long as the knocking persists. While the waldgeist
    is moving toward the knocking creature, each time the waldgeist is attacked or
    is the target of a harmful effect, it receives a new saving throw. Once it is
    adjacent to the knocking creature, the waldgeist can act freely. Whether it succeeds
    at or fails its initial Will saving throw, a waldgeist is immune to that creature's
    knocking for 24 hours. Knocking on wood can draw a waldgeist out of a possessed
    tree, but not more than 50 feet from the edge of a forest or other large, wooded
    area.
  Lignify (Su): When a waldgeist deals damage to a living non-plant creature with
    its incorporeal touch, it also deals 1d4 points of Dexterity damage as it begins
    to transform the target to wood. A creature reduced to 0 Dexterity in this way
    is permanently transformed into a nonmagical tree, as per the flesh to stone spell,
    but the wooden creature has hardness 5 and vulnerability to fire. In addition
    to stone to flesh, a restoration spell can reverse this effect.
  Nature Dependent (Su): A waldgeist cannot travel more than 50 feet from the edge
    of a forest or other large, wooded area. A waldgeist that is forced outside of
    this boundary is instantly destroyed. A waldgeist receives a +4 racial bonus on
    saving throws to resist teleportation or other effects that would force it outside
    of its forest.
  Possess Tree (Su): Once per minute as a standard action, a waldgeist can possess
    a Large or smaller nonmagical tree and animate it as if using animate objects,
    except the waldgeist merges with and controls the tree. The waldgeist cannot speak,
    move, or use its own attacks or special abilities while possessing the tree. When
    the tree is destroyed, or when the waldgeist ends the possession as a free action
    that provokes attacks of opportunity, the waldgeist appears in a square of its
    choice adjacent to the tree. (See page 91 for an example of a tree animated in
    this way.)
desc_long: |-
  A waldgeist arises when a gnome who was a woodlands dweller or who had a deep spiritual connection with such an area dies while in a large forest. The gnome's spirit is twisted and bound to the trees, infused with hatred of living intruders and a need to protect the area that sustains it. A waldgeist appears as a translucent gnomelike figure surrounded by a faint, green glow, its facial features full of anger and malice.

   Waldgeists become incredibly violent when faced with creatures that intrude upon their homes or that they see as threats. In combat, waldgeists attack using the forest itself, entwining despoilers' legs with roots and vines, and animating nearby trees to smash intruders with thick branches. A waldgeist is typically 3-1/2 feet tall.

**Compelling _Knock_ (Su)** A _[[monsters/Waldgeist|waldgeist]]_ is preternaturally drawn to the sound of knocking on wood. If a _waldgeist_ is within 15 feet of a creature that knocks on a wooden object (for example, a tree or an item primarily made of wood, such as a wooden _[[spells/Shield|shield]]_), it must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or it is compelled to move toward the creature for as long as the knocking persists. While the _waldgeist_ is moving toward the knocking creature, each time the _waldgeist_ is attacked or is the target of a harmful effect, it receives a new saving throw. Once it is adjacent to the knocking creature, the _waldgeist_ can act freely. Whether it succeeds at or fails its initial Will saving throw, a _waldgeist_ is immune to that creature’s knocking for 24 hours. Knocking on wood can draw a _waldgeist_ out of a possessed tree, but not more than 50 feet from the edge of a forest or other large, wooded area.

##### Description

A _waldgeist_ arises when a gnome who was a woodlands dweller or who had a deep spiritual connection with such an area dies while in a large forest. The gnome’s spirit is twisted and bound to the trees, infused with hatred of living intruders and a need to protect the area that sustains it. A _waldgeist_ appears as a translucent gnomelike figure surrounded by a faint, green glow, its facial features full of anger and malice.

Waldgeists become incredibly violent when faced with creatures that intrude upon their homes or that they see as threats. In combat, waldgeists attack using the forest itself, entwining despoilers’ legs with roots and vines, and animating nearby trees to _[[feats/Smash|smash]]_ intruders with thick branches. A _waldgeist_ is typically 3-1/2 feet tall.
