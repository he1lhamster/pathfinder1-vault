tactics:
  Before Combat: The paragon drinks her potion of bear's endurance, potion of bull's
    strength, and fervor juice.
  During Combat: Obsessed with martial prowess and proving herself superior to her
    enemies, the paragon seeks out a challenging opponent to square off against in
    one-onone combat. If faced with many foes of equal ability, she rushes from one
    to another, using Spring Attack to get their attention and draw them to her.
  Base Statistics: Without bear's endurance and bull's strength, the paragon's statistics
    are hp 97; Fort +11; Melee +1 unarmed strike +14/+9 (1d10+3) or +1 flurry of blows
    +14/+14/+9/+9/+4 (1d10+3); Ranged mwk javelin +13 (1d6+2); Str 14, Con 14; CMB

desc_long: Many hobgoblin paragons join specialized teams of fellow hobgoblins within
  larger armies, though they live isolated lives, apart from their regimented kin,
  rather than feeling a true camaraderie. A large number of them instead travel the
  world, participating in tournaments of martial skill, from gladiatorial arenas to
  competitions in distant monasteries practicing foreign techniques. Others pursue
  more mercenary endeavors, selling their talents to the highest bidder so long as
  their contract involves dishing out pain to the weak or the unworthy. Whether as
  lone bodyguards of corrupt merchants or politicians, or high-ranking enforcers of
  the criminal underworld, a hobgoblin paragon willing to serve a well-paying master
  has no trouble finding employment wherever she might seek it.

##### Description

Many _hobgoblin_ paragons join specialized teams of fellow hobgoblins within larger armies, though they live isolated lives, apart from their regimented kin, rather than feeling a true camaraderie. A large number of them instead travel the world, participating in tournaments of martial skill, from gladiatorial arenas to competitions in distant monasteries practicing foreign techniques. Others pursue more mercenary endeavors, selling their talents to the highest bidder so long as their contract involves dishing out pain to the weak or the unworthy. Whether as lone bodyguards of corrupt merchants or politicians, or high-ranking enforcers of the criminal underworld, a _hobgoblin_ paragon willing to serve a well-paying master has no trouble finding employment wherever she might seek it.
