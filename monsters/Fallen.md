# Fallen
This ghostly crusader floats just above the ground, yet despite its

phantomlike appearance, its armor and weapons seem quite solid.

### Special Abilities

**Agent of Despair (Su)** A creature that takes damage from a _[[monsters/Fallen|fallen]]_’s attacks must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or take a –4 penalty on saving throws against _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_. If a creature that has _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to _fear_ fails this saving throw, its _immunity_ is temporarily suppressed. This effect lasts as long as a creature still has damage taken from a _fallen_’s attacks. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Curse of the Unburied (Su)** Once per day, a _fallen_ can curse a good-aligned _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_, _[[classes/Paladin|paladin]]_, or _[[classes/Warpriest|warpriest]]_ within 30 feet whose deity is opposed to the creation of undead to locate the _fallen_’s remains and perform a funeral for it. The target must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or take a –2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, the target can attempt a new saving throw; success keeps the target from accruing an additional –2 penalty to each of its ability scores. No ability score can be reduced below 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed immediately upon completing funeral rites for the _fallen_. The target does not need to complete the rites personally, but it is responsible for seeing that they’re carried out. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Phantom Armaments (Su)** A _fallen_’s weapons and armor are formed of force, allowing the _fallen_ to make physical attacks and wear protective armor. This gear cannot be disarmed or removed from the _fallen_. Arrows fired from the _fallen_’s _longbow_ _[[spells/Vanish|vanish]]_ after dealing damage to their target. A _fallen_ gains a bonus on attack rolls with melee weapons and on combat maneuver checks equal to its Charisma modifier.

**Rejuvenation (Su)** A _fallen_ is tied to the place where it died. A _fallen_ is permanently destroyed and its soul is released when funeral rites lasting at least 1 minute are performed at the site where it perished or over its earthly remains. Otherwise, a _fallen_ reforms 2d4 days after its _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ at the site where it first died.

**Touch of the Grave (Su)** All of a _fallen_’s melee and ranged attacks deal 2d6 additional points of negative energy damage to living targets (this does not _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ undead targets struck).

##### Description

When a _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Righteous|righteous]]_ crusader is denied the path to the afterlife in death, its spirit can rise as one of the _fallen_— undead driven to enact a crusade against all life in a frustrated corruption of their beliefs. The undead creature’s fall in battle remains the greatest disappointment vexing its soul. Driven by hatred and shame, the _fallen_ wander battlefields and wildlands in constant search of someone to end their misery by performing _[[feats/Last Rites|last rites]]_.
