##### Description

_[[monsters/Undigested|Undigested]]_ are the animate slurry of the indigestible parts

of a humanoid creature. They come into being when a giant

beast that swallowed its prey alive is slain by unspeakable

necromantic arts. A primal shard of the beast’s sentience is

ripped from it during the agonizing moments of its death,

animating the gelatinous humanoid remains within its

stomach into an ooze-like undead creature which hungers

to inf lict its digestive fate upon others. If the beast was

digesting multiple creatures, this phenomenon results

in _undigested_ swarms instead. _Undigested_—implacable

ambush predators—slop, ooze, and undulate through

the dark places of the world in search

of sustenance.
