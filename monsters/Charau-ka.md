  Shrieking Frenzy (Su): Once per day, a charau-ka can enter a state of shrieking
    frenzy as a free action. While in this state, the charau-ka automatically fails
    Stealth checks and cannot speak or cast spells that use verbal components (or
    use items that require command words to activate), but functions as if under the
    effects of a haste spell. The charauka can continue shrieking for up to 3 rounds,
    after which it is staggered for 1 round.
  Thrown-Weapon Mastery (Ex): Charau-ka are masters of thrown weapons. All charau-ka
    gain Throw Anything as a bonus feat. In addition, a charau-ka gains a +1 racial
    bonus on all thrown weapons, and their threat range for thrown weapons is doubled,
    as if the charau-ka possessed the Improved Critical feat for all thrown weapons.
    This effect doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the threat range
    of a weapon.
desc_long: |-
  Although they call themselves the charau-ka, these dangerous jungle dwellers are often known to colonists and explorers as ape-men. Legend holds that the charau-ka stem from the demon lord Angazhan, who transformed the bodies of the first humans that tried to wage war against his cult, causing the dead to rise as the first apemen. Rumors that charau-ka clerics have perfected a hideous ritual to force those slain to reincarnate as new charau-ka are popular tales among jungle explorers-but proof of such a magic spell has yet to reach civilization.

  Today, the charau-ka are one of the most fecund and widespread races of creatures in the Mwangi Expanse. Not all of them serve the Gorilla King or worship Angazhan; some have become feral monsters little more organized than apes, while others may have turned to the worship of other demon lords or even the snake-god Ydersius.

  Charau-ka generally dwell in small tribes of a few dozen members. They often keep dangerous jungle creatures as pets or guardians, trusting to their druids or animal handlers to keep the deadly beasts under control. A typical charau-ka village extends from the jungle f loor up into the canopy above, and usually includes several treehouse-style structures connected by vines or rope bridges.
