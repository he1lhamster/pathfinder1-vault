  Integrated Body (Ex): An ahkhat derives its form from the structure it inhabits,
    emerging from the walls, floors, and ceilings. An ahkhat cannot manifest from
    broken areas or separate from the building's surface; it can only move within
    the building materials. An ahkhat occupies the same space as the area of the structure
    from which it is presently manifesting. If an ahkhat is somehow moved 10 or more
    feet away from its structure, it takes 1d8 points of damage; at the beginning
    of its next turn, the ahkhat immediately returns to the nearest space within its
    structure. When not manifesting, an ahkhat can't be attacked normally, but it
    is instantly destroyed if 75% of its attuned building is destroyed. If an ahkhat's
    keystone is destroyed, the ahkhat is instantly destroyed.
  Structural Mobility (Su): An ahkhat can move through walls, floors, and ceilings
    of any material except metal, similar to the earth glide ability. It cannot move
    through significantly damaged or ruined sections of a structure until they are
    repaired. If an area containing an ahkhat is targeted with a passwall spell or
    similar effect, the ahkhat takes 1d8 points of damage and is immediately shunted
    to the nearest available space in its structure.
desc_long: |-
  An ahkhat is an elemental entity that dwells within a single building or structure. An ahkhat exists solely to maintain and protect that structure. Far from a mere butler, an ahkhat is a structure's consciousness incarnate.

  Ahkhats are bound and attuned to their structures via a special keystone, usually a heavy stone block. The keystone must be part of a structure's foundation or cornerstone, or an actual keystone within an arch. The keystone is typically carved with an icon of a humanoid figure, beneath which is written the ahkhat's name. Anyone in possession of or touching the keystone who speaks the name can attempt to compel the ahkhat to do his will, including forcing the ahkhat inside the keystone to accept residence in a new structure, though ahkhats moving to new buildings prefer to have their original stones moved as well.

##### Description

An _ahkhat_ is an elemental entity that dwells within a single building or structure. An _ahkhat_ exists solely to maintain and protect that structure. Far from a mere butler, an _ahkhat_ is a structure’s consciousness incarnate.

Ahkhats are bound and attuned to their structures via a special keystone, usually a heavy stone block. The keystone must be part of a structure’s foundation or cornerstone, or an actual keystone within an arch. The keystone is typically carved with an icon of a humanoid figure, beneath which is written the _ahkhat_’s name. Anyone in _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_ of or touching the keystone who speaks the name can attempt to compel the _ahkhat_ to do his will, including forcing the _ahkhat_ inside the keystone to accept residence in a new structure, though ahkhats moving to new buildings prefer to have their original stones moved as well.
