special_abilities:
  Iron Resilience (Ex): Once per round, a mythic ogre can ignore an attack that would
    reduce it to negative hit points or kill it. The ogre takes no damage from the
    attack. As an immediate action, a mythic ogre can expend one use of mythic power
    to use this ability to ignore all attacks from one creature for 1 round.
  Rising Fury (Ex): Each time a mythic ogre takes damage, it gains a +2 morale bonus
    on damage rolls until the end of its next turn. This bonus increases by +2 each
    time the ogre takes damage, up to a maximum of +10. At the end of the ogre's turn,
    this damage bonus resets to +0.
desc_long: A mythic ogre is an example of inbreeding going exactly right, the perfect
  combination of hardiness and fast maturity without any significant deformities that
  would hamper its ability to hunt. Able to evade death like a monstrous cockroach
  and prone to violent outbursts like a berserk child, a mythic ogre has all the qualities
  common ogres admire, and easily takes over the family unit by browbeating others
  into submission. Some even manage to dominate hill giant tribes with sheer numbers,
  making the next generation taller and stronger.

##### Description

Stories are told of ogres—horrendous stories of brutality and savagery, cannibalism and torture. Of rape and dismemberment, necrophilia, incest, mutilation, and all manners of hideous murder. Those who have not encountered ogres know the stories as warnings. Those who have survived such encounters know these tales to be tame compared to the truth.

An _[[monsters/Ogre|ogre]]_ revels in the misery of others. When smaller races aren’t available to crush between meaty fists or defile in blood-red lusts of violence, they turn to each other for entertainment. Nothing is taboo in _ogre_ society. One would think that, left to themselves, an _ogre_ tribe would quickly tear itself apart, with only the strongest surviving in the end—yet if there is one thing ogres respect, it is family.

_Ogre_ tribes are known as families, and many of their deformities and hideous features arise from the common practice of incest. The leader of a tribe is most often the father of the tribe, although in some cases a particularly violent or domineering ogress claims the title of mother. _Ogre_ tribes bicker among themselves, a trait that thankfully keeps them busy and turned against each other rather than neighboring races. Yet time and again, a particularly violent and feared patriarch rises among the ogres, one capable of gathering multiple families under his _[[spells/Command|command]]_.

Regions inhabited by ogres are dreary, ugly places, for these giants dwell in squalor and see little need to live in harmony with their environment. The borderland between civilization and _ogre_ territory is a desperate realm of outcasts and despair, for here dwell the _[[monsters/Ogrekin|ogrekin]]_, the deformed offspring and results of frequent _ogre_ raids against the lands of the smaller folk.

_Ogre_ games are violent and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_, and victims they use for entertainment are _[[feats/Lucky|lucky]]_ if they die the first day. Ogres’ _cruel_ senses of humor are the only way their crude minds show any _[[spells/Spark|spark]]_ of creativity, and the tools and methods of torture ogres devise are always nightmarish.

An _ogre_’s great strength and lack of imagination makes it particularly suited for heavy labor, such as mining, forging, and clearing land, and more powerful giants (particularly hill giants and stone giants) often subjugate _ogre_ families to serve them in such regards.

A typical adult _ogre_ stands 10 feet tall and weighs roughly 650 pounds.
