desc_short: A canine form slinks from the shadows. Thick, russet fur covers its sleek
  form. Two large ears top its narrow, dog-like face, and it opens its jaws to reveal
  pointed ivory teeth. Instead of a bushy tail, a bony whip extends from its hindquarters,
  almost like a scorpion's tail.

  Dhabbas are scavenging predators that prefer to raid garbage pits and battle sites for food, but sometimes hunt small creatures to supplement their diets. Mice, rats, hares, and toads make their favorite prey.

  Native to Katapesh, dhabbas survive in the warm climate by benefit of their bushy red coats which insulate them against the heat. Most dhabbas are the size of small dogs or foxes, and have both fox and jackal features. They measure 4 feet long and weigh up to 100 pounds. Their most distinctive feature is their bony, hairless tails.
