  Prismatic Aura (Su): As a swift action once per day, a humbaba can activate its
    prismatic aura. Doing so causes brilliant light to radiate from the humbaba to
    a radius of 30 feet. Each round at the start of the humbaba's turn, roll 1d8 and
    consult the table of prismatic spray effects to determine the color and effect
    of the light (reroll results of 8). If a creature begins its turn in the prismatic
    aura's area, it must make the appropriate saving throw (DC 26) against that effect.
    Once activated, a humbaba's prismatic aura lasts for 7 rounds. The save DC is
    Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  Humbabas are monstrous humanoids of tremendous size and power that prowl the forgotten places of the world. Although a humbaba has the body of a powerful, muscular human, its face is a twisted mockery that seems more leonine than human. They often braid portions of their manes or otherwise decorate them with skulls and weapons, and prefer to wear half-plate armor and fight with longswords.

  The first humbabas were once the favored minions of the demon lord Pazuzu. In those days, humbabas had magnificent birdlike wings. But when the mightiest of the humbabas dared to attack Pazuzu in an ill-conceived attempt to claim the demon lord's throne, Pazuzu punished the entire humbaba race by stripping them of their wings and casting them into the Material Plane. There they now dwell, forever denied the skies and cursed to live lonely lives, incapable of forming even the barest of friendships or alliances with others of their kind.

##### Description

Humbabas are monstrous humanoids of tremendous size and power that prowl the forgotten places of the world. Although a _humbaba_ has the body of a powerful, muscular human, its face is a twisted mockery that seems more leonine than human. They often braid portions of their manes or otherwise decorate them with skulls and weapons, and prefer to wear _half-plate_ armor and fight with longswords.

The first humbabas were once the favored minions of the demon lord Pazuzu. In those days, humbabas had magnificent birdlike wings. But when the mightiest of the humbabas dared to attack Pazuzu in an ill-conceived attempt to claim the demon lord’s throne, Pazuzu punished the entire _humbaba_ race by stripping them of their wings and casting them into the Material Plane. There they now dwell, forever denied the skies and cursed to live lonely lives, incapable of forming even the barest of friendships or alliances with others of their kind.
