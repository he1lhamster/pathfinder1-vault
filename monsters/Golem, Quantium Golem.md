  Eldritch Surge (Su): A Quantium golem can hurl a lance of eldritch energy that deals
    30d6 points of damage to all creatures in a 240-foot line (Reflex DC 25 for half).
    The crimson Quantium golem deals half electricity and half fire damage, and slows
    a creature (as the slow spell) that fails its save for 2d4 rounds. The green Quantium
    golem deals half acid and half fire damage, and nauseates any creature that fails
    its save for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Immunity to Magic (Ex): A Quantium golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability
    that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
    differently against the creature, as noted. A magical attack that deals cold damage
    against the crimson golem or electricity damage against the green golem slows
    it (as the slow spell) for 1 round, with no saving throw.A Quantium golem and
    its equipment are immune to rust attacks.
  Link (Su): Each Quantium golem always knows the exact location of the other.
  Urban Defender (Su): A Quantium golem gains 150 bonus hit points as long as it's
    within 1 mile of the city. If it moves beyond this range, it loses these bonus
    hit points.

  Around the perimeter of Quantium, two immense golems march a patrol uninterrupted since the days of the archmage Nex himself. They stand as mirror images of each other, one crimson in hue and bearing a sword in the right hand, the other green and with sword in the left. Legend holds that Nex crafted the golems to defend his capital during a time of desperate struggle in which he foresaw his own absence.

  The golems only pause in their unending patrol if attacked or obstructed, and then only until they eliminate or circumvent the obstacle, whichever is most direct. The golems always patrol at opposite ends of the city, marching counterclockwise and pausing if their partner is interrupted. They last broke from patrolling in 576 ar, when they fought the Gebbite horde in the very battle in which Nex vanished from Golarion.

##### Description

Around the perimeter of Quantium, two immense golems march a patrol uninterrupted since the days of the archmage Nex himself. They stand as _[[items/Mundane/Mirror|mirror]]_ images of each other, one crimson in hue and bearing a sword in the right hand, the other green and with sword in the left. Legend holds that Nex crafted the golems to defend his capital during a time of desperate struggle in which he foresaw his own absence.

The golems only pause in their unending patrol if attacked or obstructed, and then only until they eliminate or circumvent the obstacle, whichever is most direct. The golems always patrol at opposite ends of the city, marching counterclockwise and pausing if their partner is interrupted. They last broke from patrolling in 576 ar, when they fought the Gebbite horde in the very battle in which Nex vanished from Golarion.
