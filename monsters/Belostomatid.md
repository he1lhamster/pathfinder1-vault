  Digestive Enzymes (Ex): A belostomatid injects a corrosive enzyme into its prey
    that both paralyzes and liquefies flesh. A creature struck by the belostomatid's
    piercing bite must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds.
    For every round the creature is paralyzed it takes 1d2 points of Constitution
    damage.
  Hold Breath (Ex): A belostomatid can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal
    to 4 times its Constitution score before it risks drowning.
desc_long: |-
  The belostomatid is the monstrous form of its diminutive counterpart, a 5-inch-long “giant” water bug commonly known as a “toe-biter.” A monstrous belostomatid has a f lattened, oval-shaped body measuring 12 feet long, and four rear, oarlike legs, which it uses to thrust through the water. The belostomatid's front two legs are thick and end in sharp, single-tipped claws, which it uses to slay its prey. Two large black eyes are mounted on each side of the creature's rostrum, and it uses its 2-foot-long, beaklike proboscis to inject its deadly acidic enzymes into its victims.

  Belostomatids are ambush predators. They hide amid f loating snags and piles of debris in still and slow-moving waters, seamlessly blending in with their surroundings despite their size. With a powerful surge forward, a belostomatid grabs its prey, thrusts its rostrum deep into the prey's body, and begins pumping a paralyzing digestive enzyme into its prey, dissolving it from the inside out.

##### Description

The _belostomatid_ is the monstrous form of its diminutive counterpart, a 5-inch-long “giant” water bug commonly known as a “toe-biter.” A monstrous _belostomatid_ has a f lattened, oval-shaped body measuring 12 feet long, and four rear, oarlike legs, which it uses to thrust through the water. The _belostomatid_’s front two legs are thick and end in sharp, single-tipped claws, which it uses to slay its prey. Two large black eyes are mounted on each side of the creature’s rostrum, and it uses its 2-foot-long, beaklike proboscis to inject its _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ acidic enzymes into its victims.

Belostomatids are ambush predators. They hide amid f loating snags and piles of debris in still and slow-moving waters, seamlessly blending in with their surroundings despite their size. With a powerful surge forward, a _belostomatid_ grabs its prey, thrusts its rostrum deep into the prey’s body, and begins pumping a paralyzing digestive enzyme into its prey, dissolving it from the inside out.
