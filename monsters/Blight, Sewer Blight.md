### Special Abilities

**_Acidic Spray_ (Ex)** As an immediate action, a sewer _blight_ can spray a blast of acid on any creature that damages it with a melee attack. This spray of acid deals 8d6 points of acid damage, _[[universal monster rules/Split|split]]_ evenly between the weapon and the weapon’s wielder (if the weapon was a natural weapon or an unarmed strike, the full damage applies to the attacker). A successful DC 27 Reflex save halves the acid damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**_Command_ Ooze (Su)** Unintelligent oozes never attack a sewer _blight_, and a sewer _blight_ can target any mindless ooze with _dominate monster_, even though they are normally immune to this mind-affecting spell. When a sewer _blight_ dominates an ooze in this way, it gains enough influence over the ooze for the ooze to carry out simple commands (such as “_[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_ this room,” “flank this foe,” or “bring me that dead body”).

**Plagued Domain (Su)** The first time a creature enters a sewer _blight_’s domain in a 24-hour period, it must succeed at a DC 27 Reflex save or contract _[[diseases/Filth Fever|filth fever]]_. Within the domain, the save DCs for all disease-based effects inflicted by creatures under the sewer _blight_’s control increase by 2 and onset times for all diseases contracted there are reduced to 0.

##### Description

Sewer blights are unusual among their kind in that they thrive in artificial ecosystems rather than purely natural environs. These oozes prefer to lair in the sewers of large cities, and they see in the foul infestations, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Toxic|toxic]]_ fungi, and diseased creatures dwelling in such filthy warrens a sort of perverse rebuttal of civilization by the natural world. Those who dwell in the cities above are their preferred prey.

A sewer _blight_ is 6 feet in diameter and weighs 300 pounds.
