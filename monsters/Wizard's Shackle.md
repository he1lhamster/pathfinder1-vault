### Special Abilities

**Host Buffer (Ex)** A _[[classes/Wizard|wizard]]_’s _[[spells/Shackle|shackle]]_ that has dominated a host

uses the host’s saving throws if they are better than the

_wizard_’s _shackle_’s saving throws.

**_Puppet Master_ (Su)** If a _wizard_’s _shackle_ attaches to a

creature that can cast spells or use _spell-like abilities_,

the target creature must succeed at a DC 14 Will save

or become dominated (as per _[[spells/Dominate Monster|dominate monster]]_). The

domination lasts as long as the _wizard_’s _shackle_ remains

in contact with the victim. If the target would receive a

new save against the effect (as described in the spell), a

successful save allows it to avoid taking the action, but

doesn’t end the domination. The save DC is Intelligencebased

and includes a +2 racial bonus.

**Tenacious Grip (Ex)** A _wizard_’s _shackle_ gains a +8 bonus on

combat maneuver checks to grapple and to CMD against

grapple combat maneuvers.

##### Description

_Wizard_’s shackles are intelligent, eel-like parasites with

tough bodies covered in pulsating veins. A _wizard_’s _shackle_

not attached to a host is quite cowardly and typically f lees

if it can. However, if the _wizard_’s _shackle_ becomes aware

of a creature capable of casting spells or using spell-like

abilities, it becomes extraordinarily aggressive. Once it

establishes physical contact with such a creature, a _wizard_’s

_shackle_ attempts to dominate its host. _Wizard_’s shackles

can’t control non-spellcasters, and never attempt to.

Though _wizard_’s shackles are intelligent, they don’t have

a society of their own and, without a host, they perform

simple acts like eating, mating, and sleeping in the

fashion of mindless vermin. However, once it dominates

a spellcasting host, a _wizard_’s _shackle_ reveals its

full potential. Driven by strange yearnings and

enigmatic impulses, a _wizard_’s _shackle_ leads

its host to perform various tasks that don’t

make sense from an outside perspective. Most

of these tasks are _[[spells/Weird|weird]]_ but benign, such as

using magic to steal a merchant’s silverware

or fix the roof of a peasant’s house. Rarely, a

_wizard_’s _shackle_ will force its host to commit

murder or other brutal acts intended to

fulfill some _[[monsters/Unknown|unknown]]_ purpose, though

most victims of such actions tend to

be wicked or corrupt in their own rights.

Regardless, _wizard_’s shackles attached to hosts

have an alien but almost _[[feats/Childlike|childlike]]_ curiosity

when it comes to humanoid society, and only the

prospect of discovering more can distract them

from their enigmatic tasks.

_Wizard_’s shackles latched onto

hosts will sometimes form a

social group, like a mage’s guild

composed solely of dominated spellcasters.

These collectives tend to work toward goals just

as incomprehensible, if not more so, than an individual

_wizard_’s _shackle_. Such goals might include spending a week

dedicated to cleaning all the city’s fountains until they

shine or building an obelisk made of hollow copper.

A typical _wizard_’s _shackle_ measures a mere foot in

length and weighs about 2 pounds.
