### Special Abilities

**Opportunist Mauler (Ex)** A sodden _[[monsters/Draugr|draugr]]_ troop can deal sneak attack damage to foes in its space. When it makes a successful sneak attack, it can forgo any number of sneak attack dice to increase the initial save DC and the duration in rounds of its nausea ability by an equal amount.
 **Nausea (Su)** A creature damaged by a sodden _draugr_ troop must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or be _[[conditions/Nauseated|nauseated]]_ for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.
 **Sodden Field (Ex)** As a free action, a sodden _draugr_ troop can douse an area with _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Putrid|putrid]]_ seaweed and vermin. This affects the sodden _draugr_ troop's space and all adjacent squares for 1 minute. This area becomes difficult terrain; anyone who attempts to move through a sodden field must succeed at a DC 17 Reflex save or be _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_. A sodden _draugr_ troop is immune to this effect. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
 **Vomiting Deluge (Su)** A sodden _draugr_ troop can vomit a torrent of water as a standard action. This attack takes the form of up to two lines with a range of 20 feet. These lines can each start from any square the troop occupies. Creatures in these lines take 2d8 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 17 half). The save DC is Dexterity-based.

##### Description

When a large number of individuals drown, such as an

entire ship’s crew, they join into a mob of sodden _draugr_.
