### Special Abilities

**Blistering Slime (Ex)** A creature that leaves a pest drake

swarm’s space becomes coated in acidic slime. A creature

coated in acidic slime takes 3d6 points of acid damage at

the end of its turn each round. As a full-round action, an

affected creature can attempt a DC 18 Reflex save to clean

off the slime. Dropping and rolling on the ground grants a

+4 bonus on this save. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Caustic Cloud (Su)** The dragons making up the pest drake

swarm can coordinate their acidic breath together to create

a caustic cloud as a standard action. The _[[monsters/Pest Drake Swarm|pest drake swarm]]_

can create a caustic cloud once every 1d4 rounds. All

creatures within a 10-foot-radius burst, including creatures

within the swarm’s squares, take 8d6 points of acid damage

(Reflex DC 20 half). The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Homing (Ex)** As a standard action, the _pest drake swarm_

can determine its approximate distance from its home as

well as the direction it must travel to reach it. A pest drake

must spend 1 week in a new location to designate the new

location as its home.

##### Description

Roosting on statuary and eaves, pest drakes are the _[[spells/Bane|bane]]_ of

masons and carpenters across Golarion. By itself, a single

pest drake is a tolerated nuisance, eating insects and other

vermin in the city. Its distinctive song-like chirp greets

passersby and thanks those who throw it scraps of food.

When pest drakes gather, however, they become much

more dangerous. The little wyvern-like dragons erode the

stone where they nest and grow territorial in large groups,

becoming _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_, acid-spitting flocks when agitated.

Some of the smallest dragons, adult pest drakes are just

under a foot in length and weigh 1–2 pounds. They live

approximately 10–15 years.
