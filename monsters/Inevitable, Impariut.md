  Kingslayer (Su): Against any creature with a title denoting leadership or nobility

    attack rolls and deal an additional 1d8 damage. Against any creature recognized
    as an autonomous region's head of state (such as an empress or king), an impariut's
    attacks instead gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls, deal an additional 2d8 damage,
    and ignore any damage reduction the target has.
  Royal Gift (Su): Once per day as a full-round action, an impariut can grant its
    blessing to a willing humanoid creature by touching it for 1 full round. The target
    gains a +1 sacred bonus on Will saving throws; a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws
    against disease and poison; and a +2 sacred bonus on Knowledge (history), Knowledge
    (nobility), and Sense Motive checks for 1 year. A single creature can have no
    more than one royal gift from an impariut at a time. As long as the royal gift
    lasts, the impariut can sense the target's position and general condition, as
    per status. The impariut can remove a royal gift as a free action, and a royal
    gift can be removed by dispel law. An impariut can only maintain one royal gift
    for every 4 Hit Dice it has (3 royal gifts for a standard impariut).
desc_long: |-
  Monarchs, dictators, governors, and mayors may rule under the pretense of sustaining lawful civilization, yet those who abuse their power or harm their people undermine the foundation of government. To the forces of Axis, these bad actors represent a threat to cosmic order and a means by which the chaos of uprisings and revolution can take hold. The mortal agents of lawful deities are responsible for encouraging responsible governance; where they fail, an impariut must intervene.

   Each impariut is a stern counselor sent to reform a powerful leader, guiding that figure toward sustainable policies that maintain order. Unlike many inevitables that care only that the universal order is upheld, impariuts exhibit slightly more patience and flexibility, knowing that an iron-fisted response is as likely to trigger riots as a negligent regime. As a result, impariuts are capable diplomats and teachers, equally proficient with incentives as with unflinching punishments.

   An impariut stands precisely 7 feet tall and weighs exactly 350 pounds.
