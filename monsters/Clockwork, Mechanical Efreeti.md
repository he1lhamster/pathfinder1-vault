  Mechanical genies are best used as stationary guards rather than scouts, and are often placed in pairs so they can wind each other up. They stand 2 feet tall and weigh around 8 pounds.

   The most common mechanical genie is that presented above. A mechanical efreeti has a face sculpted into a permanent scowl and an inner boiler to heat its large fists.
