special_abilities:
  Bardic Performance (Su): Ashava has the bardic performance ability of a 20th-level
    bard, granting her access to the distraction, fascinate, inspire courage, inspire
    competence, suggestion, inspire greatness, soothing performance, inspire heroics,
    mass suggestion, and deadly performance aspects of bardic performance. Ashava's
    fascinate and inspire heroics bardic performances can affect any number of creatures
    that can see and hear her. There is no limit to the number of rounds Ashava can
    use her bardic performances each day.
  Hypnotize Undead (Su): Ashava can affect undead creatures with her fascinate bardic
    performance, despite their immunity to enchantment or mind-affecting effects,
    and she can command any number of undead creatures fascinated in this way as a
    standard action, per command undead (Will DC 41 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Luminescent Form (Su): As a swift action, Ashava can transform herself into pure
    moonlight, becoming incorporeal. Her fly speed triples in luminescent form, but
    she can't use any of her spell-like abilities or her moonlight javelin attack.
    She can return to her corporeal form as a swift action.
  Lyrical Grace (Ex): Ashava gains a sacred bonus to her Armor Class and on initiative
    checks equal to her Charisma modifier. She can ignore any effect that would reduce
    her speed or prevent her from taking a 5-foot step.
  Moonlight Javelin (Su): As a free action, Ashava can conjure a +5 holy javelin created
    out of solid moonlight into her hand. This weapon deals force damage, has a range
    increment of 100 feet, and dazzles any target it strikes for 1 month or until
    Ashava chooses to end a target's dazzled condition as a free action. Ashava adds
    her Charisma modifier to damage rolls with her moonlight javelins. A moonlight
    javelin vanishes once it leaves Ashava's hand (or, if thrown, it vanishes after
    striking or missing its target).
  Primal Aura (Su): Ashava constantly shines with the light of the moon. No effect
    can reduce the light level in her primal aura below dim light, unless she allows
    it or unless the effect is created by a more powerful deity. Weapons wielded in
    Ashava's primal aura are treated as chaotic-aligned, good-aligned, and silver
    for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
desc_long: |-
  Long ago in the wild and lonely fens of Elysium, a collection of helpful marsh lights coalesced to form Ashava, the True Spark. Ashava is constant motion, spinning and twirling in steps that soothe all who watch her dance. Although she often remains at a distance from those who watch her, she nevertheless leads them out of wild places and back to the safety of civilization. She believes that no being-whether living or dead-should suffer the fear of being lost.

   A part of Ashava lives in the hearts of all dancers, and her influence can be felt by those who rise from their seats when moved by a stirring beat or melodious chords. She believes that dance is the soul's truest form of expression, and she looks down on those who would stifle their own or others' creativity in this field. Ashava maintains that there is no wrong way to dance, and that dance not only embodies but transcends culture. She derives as much pleasure from the clumsy steps of eager but novice dancers as she does the practiced movements of professional ballerinas.

   Ashava spends much of her time dancing through darkened swamps across many worlds, aiding lost travelers and fighting evil forces that would disorient and waylay them. On Elysium, Ashava's realm is the Sparkling Fens, a swamp eternally bathed in moonlight. It rests at the base of the Mountain of Lingering Soulsong, and the mountain's echoing melodies drift down into the marsh to provide Ashava and the azatas who follow her with accompaniment to their never-ending dances. No one can remain lost for very long within the Sparkling Fens, as floating globes of light-similar to will-o'-wisps in appearance but kindly in temperament-always appear to guide visitors to safety. These lights are both servants of Ashava and part of her, and she can feel and control them no matter where she is in the cosmos as if they were extensions of her own limbs.

##### Description

Long ago in the wild and lonely fens of Elysium, a collection of helpful marsh lights coalesced to form Ashava, the True _[[spells/Spark|Spark]]_. Ashava is constant motion, spinning and twirling in steps that soothe all who watch her dance. Although she often remains at a distance from those who watch her, she nevertheless leads them out of wild places and back to the safety of civilization. She believes that no being—whether living or dead—should suffer the _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ of being lost.

A part of Ashava lives in the hearts of all dancers, and her influence can be felt by those who rise from their seats when moved by a stirring beat or melodious chords. She believes that dance is the soul’s truest form of expression, and she looks down on those who would stifle their own or others’ creativity in this field. Ashava maintains that there is no wrong way to dance, and that dance not only embodies but transcends culture. She derives as much pleasure from the clumsy steps of eager but novice dancers as she does the practiced movements of professional ballerinas.
