title1: Stygira
desc_short: Gaunt and parched, this crone-like figure moves with the predatory jerkiness
  of a hunting vulture. Unnaturally tall and lean, her form is all cracked flesh and
  stony crevices spanning a wasteland of withered gray flesh. Shattered black teeth
  jut from a chapped, lipless mouth that stretches beneath a high, scarred brow devoid
  of nose or eyes.

special_abilities:
  Gem Eye (Su): Stygiras possess a special connection with gemstones. While holding
    or otherwise in contact with a gemstone of at least the size of a human eye, a
    stygira can see through the gemstone like a magical eye, viewing her surroundings
    as if her blindsense extended to 120 feet and she were under the effects of true
    seeing, which grants her a +4 bonus on Perception checks.
  Gem Gaze (Su): Shaken for 1d4 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 16 negates. The save
    DC is Charisma-based. A stygira can only make use of this ability while holding
    a gemstone.
  Light Blindness: Despite their effective blindness, stygiras remain sensitive to
    light. Abrupt exposure to bright light blinds stygiras for 1 round; on subsequent
    rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain in the affected area.
  Stone Curse (Su): |-
    Any creature struck by a stygira's claws must make a DC 18 Will save or be affected by a curse that gradually drains it of color, stiffens its joints, and finally turns the victim to stone. This curse proves frighteningly unpredictable, forcing another save against its effects every 1d3 hours. Any creature that is drained to 0 Dexterity or fails three saves against the curse is permanently petrified. Even if a creature is petrified and then restored to flesh, it is still affected by the curse and is petrified again upon failing its next save against the curse. A stone curse can only be removed in one of two ways: by casting remove curse or by spending a full hour in unobstructed natural sunlight. Magical radiance like daylight does not affect a stone curse, and remove curse does not return a petrified creature to flesh. The save DC is Constitution-based.

    Stone curse: Claw-curse; save Will DC 18; frequency 1/1d3 hours; effect 1d6 Dex damage, failing 3 saves results in petrification; cure casting remove curse or spending 1 hour in natural sunlight
desc_long: |-
  Withered hermits wrapped in tattered black rags, these scarred, eyeless crones slip through the dark crevasses of both earth and time. Degenerate inheritors of the half-remembered, collapsed cyclops civilizations, the stygiras-or stone witches, as they are often called- command strange secrets of the earth and interpret the fateful energies of the depths. Ages of communion with the darkness and reliance upon alien magics have corrupted the stygiras from the primitive human witches their ancestors were countless ages ago, transforming them into a terrifying, debased breed infused with magics not their own. In many a savage land, these crones were once or are still worshiped as seers and demigods, weaving magic and communing with the earth to manipulate their servants into obeying their selfish and grotesque whims. In other realms, they haunt the night, prowling from their caves to feed upon the unwary or make alliances with those cruel and ambitious enough to believe their perverse counsel. Yet for all their perverse blasphemies and primitive desires, their powers to see what none should and reduce life to brittle stone proves enough to inspire dread and superstitious belief in nearly all who hear of the harsh stone witches.

  Stygiras on average stand 6-1/2 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**Gem Eye (Su)** Stygiras possess a special connection with gemstones.

**Gem _Gaze_ (Su)** _[[conditions/Shaken|Shaken]]_ for 1d4 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 16 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based. A _stygira_ can only make use of this ability while holding a gemstone.

**Stone Curse (Su)** Any creature struck by a _stygira_’s claws must make a DC 18 Will save or be affected by a curse that gradually drains it of color, stiffens its joints, and finally turns the victim to stone. This curse proves frighteningly unpredictable, forcing another save against its effects every 1d3 hours. Any creature that is drained to 0 Dexterity or fails three saves against the curse is permanently _[[conditions/Petrified|petrified]]_. Even if a creature is _petrified_ and then restored to flesh, it is still affected by the curse and is _petrified_ again upon failing its next save against the curse. A stone curse can only be removed in one of two ways: by casting _[[spells/Remove Curse|remove curse]]_ or by spending a full hour in unobstructed natural sunlight. Magical _[[items/Weapon/Radiance|radiance]]_ like _[[spells/Daylight|daylight]]_ does not affect a stone curse, and _remove curse_ does not return a _petrified_ creature to flesh. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Stone curse: Claw—curse; save Will DC 18; frequency 1/1d3 hours; effect 1d6 Dex damage, failing 3 saves results in petrification; cure casting _remove curse_ or spending 1 hour in natural sunlight

##### Description

Withered hermits wrapped in tattered black rags, these scarred, eyeless crones slip through the dark crevasses of both earth and time. Degenerate inheritors of the half-remembered, collapsed _cyclops_ civilizations, the stygiras—or stone witches, as they are often _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_— _[[spells/Command|command]]_ strange secrets of the earth and interpret the fateful energies of the depths. Ages of communion with the _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_ and reliance upon alien magics have corrupted the stygiras from the primitive human witches their ancestors were countless ages ago, transforming them into a terrifying, debased breed infused with magics not their own. In many a savage land, these crones were once or are still worshiped as seers and demigods, weaving magic and communing with the earth to manipulate their servants into obeying their selfish and grotesque whims. In other realms, they haunt the night, prowling from their caves to feed upon the unwary or make alliances with those _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_ and ambitious enough to believe their perverse counsel. Yet for all their perverse blasphemies and primitive desires, their powers to see what none should and reduce life to brittle stone proves enough to inspire dread and superstitious belief in nearly all who hear of the harsh stone witches.

Stygiras on average stand 6-1/2 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds.
