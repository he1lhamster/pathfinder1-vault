##### Description

These flightless birds typically inhabit isolated tropical islands and coastlines that are devoid of predators and other creatures that might kill them to use as a resource. Dodos’ size and unfamiliarity with natural dangers contribute to a kind of boldness in their species—or what some would call stupidity—causing them to bumble into precarious situations and making them easy targets for other creatures that are on the prowl for a tasty meal. The birds can all too easily be caught and slain, and while their meat has a most unpleasant taste, few starving, shipwrecked sailors would turn such a providential meal down.
