### Special Abilities

**Hidey-Hole (Su)** When a _[[monsters/Kikimora|kikimora]]_ chooses a house to

inhabit, she can create an extradimensional space

by scrawling a sigil on a wall, baseboard, cupboard,

or other permanent object (such as a stove). This sigil serves

as the entrance to the _kikimora_’s tiny domain, where

she can live within the house without being detected.

Only the _kikimora_ can enter this hidey-hole. Anytime after

designating a hidey-hole, the _kikimora_ can transport herself

and up to 50 pounds of objects to the hidey-hole as a

standard action, as long as she is in the same room as

the sigil. The _kikimora_ can exit the hidey-hole in

the same way, appearing in the nearest empty

square to the sigil. Any objects left within the

hidey-hole remain there when the _kikimora_ exits

the space, even if she removes the sigil and places it in

another location. While inside the hidey-hole, the _kikimora_

can see what is going on outside of the space through a

special sensor, as if the _kikimora_ were standing where her

sigil is placed. As a result, mundane objects placed in front of the sigil can block the _kikimora_’s sight from the hidey-hole.

##### Description

Kikimoras are house spirits who torment those with whom

they live unless the poor folk cater to and cajole them. They

delight in stressing homeowners by using illusion magic to

make the house look much filthier than it actually is; their

favored illusions are those of scuttling vermin.

Kikimoras are enemies of brownies. While brownies

can be mischievous, kikimoras often invite pain and

frustration on their chosen housemates instead of helping

chores along. Some brownies actively seek out kikimorainfested

homes with the intention of driving out the

_[[feats/Disruptive|disruptive]]_ fey creatures. When homeowners refuse to

appease a resident _kikimora_ (or can’t rid themselves of her

devious presence), the _kikimora_ visits upon them a swarm

of spiders, rats, or bats. Because of the subtle tricks these

fey employ, inhabitants in homes plagued by kikimoras

often believe they have been beset by ghosts.

Kikimoras love secretly _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Breaking|breaking]]_ things or making

such _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ seem like an accident. They proceed to

trick the people in the house into leaving gifts in return

for making repairs at night, much to the indignation of

brownies, who view such gifts as payments for services

rendered and resent the kikimoras’ _[[spells/Transformation|transformation]]_ of

such agreements into coercion.
