    Cockroach swarms are dazzled in bright sunlight or within the radius of a daylight spell.

    Monstrous cockroaches come in a wide variety of sizes and colors, ranging from dark brown or black to lighter shades such as red or yellow, sometimes with multicolored banding across their abdomens. They have six legs and antennae and many varieties have wings. Their exoskeletons tend to have a shiny, oily appearance, though it is dry. Monstrous cockroaches vary widely in size, growing from mere inches long to the size of small buildings.

    Aside from the threat presented by overgrown cockroaches, occasionally when enjoying limitless supplies of food and few local predators, an area's population of normal cockroaches can grow to number in the millions. In such cases, the typically docile creatures can amass into dangerous swarms to protect their territories. Benefiting from their species' collective intelligence, hundreds of thousands of otherwise common cockroaches might amass in such swarms to defend their fertile territories or prey upon interlopers.
