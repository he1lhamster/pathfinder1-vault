    except it even obeys self-destructive orders) and loses the Wisdom damage it has
    taken from this ability. A subservient ally who is killed rises the next round
    as a juju zombie under the immortal ichor's control. If the ichor is killed, these
    zombies are immediately destroyed.
desc_long: An immortal ichor is an intelligent mass of blood from a dead evil deity.
  Blessed with profane powers and the will to dominate other creatures, these oozes
  are a threat to all living things. The rare few that exist are banished underground
  or sealed away in chambers that block their magical abilities. Over time these seals
  break or erode, allowing a trickle of an ooze's substance to escape and giving it
  a narrow aperture to exert its power through. Retaining vague memories of the god
  it was taken from, an immortal ichor uses its minions to find a body to possess,
  and either sets itself up as a godling or tries to find a way to revive its divine
  source.

##### Description

An _immortal ichor_ is an intelligent mass of blood from a dead evil deity. _[[feats/Blessed|Blessed]]_ with profane powers and the will to dominate other creatures, these oozes are a threat to all living things. The rare few that exist are banished underground or sealed away in chambers that block their magical abilities. Over time these seals break or erode, allowing a trickle of an ooze’s substance to escape and giving it a narrow aperture to exert its power through. Retaining vague memories of the god it was taken from, an _immortal ichor_ uses its minions to find a body to possess, and either sets itself up as a godling or tries to find a way to revive its divine source.
