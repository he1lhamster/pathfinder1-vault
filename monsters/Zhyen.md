  The zhyen is a minor genie that serves as a messenger and servant to greater beings. Despite knowledge of their superior genie status as compared to mortal spellcasters, they often serve as familiars to powerful mages, especially the genie-friends known as daivrat (see page 20). They can be summoned with the summon monster II spell.

  Each zhyen appears as a miniature djinni from the waist up, broadly muscular and attractive. Beneath the waist, the zhyen has no form at all, instead dissipating into a “tail” of the genie's favored element: a wisp of mist for air, a flowing wave for water, a trail of flame for fire, or a seemingly endless shower of stone for earth. This appearance is reflected in the skin tone of the zhyen as well, but has no influence on the genie's powers or abilities.

##### Description

The _zhyen_ is a minor genie that serves as a messenger and servant to greater beings. Despite knowledge of their superior genie _[[spells/Status|status]]_ as compared to mortal spellcasters, they often serve as familiars to powerful mages, especially the genie-friends known as daivrat (see page 20). They can be summoned with the _[[spells/Summon Monster II|summon monster II]]_ spell.

Each _zhyen_ appears as a miniature djinni from the waist up, broadly muscular and attractive. Beneath the waist, the _zhyen_ has no form at all, instead dissipating into a “tail” of the genie’s favored element: a wisp of mist for air, a flowing wave for water, a trail of flame for fire, or a seemingly endless shower of stone for earth. This appearance is reflected in the skin tone of the _zhyen_ as well, but has no influence on the genie’s powers or abilities.
