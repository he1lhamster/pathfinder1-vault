special_abilities:
  Aura of Truth (Sp): An apocrisiarius kyton exudes an aura of truth, making it difficult
    for anyone within 30 feet to utter a lie. This effect functions as per zone of
    truth, save that it emanates from the kyton (not a fixed point in space) and thus
    moves along with the kyton. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Lancet Mastery (Su): An apocrisiarius kyton wields two lancets in combat. In the
    kyton's hands, these weapons function as +1 keen punching daggers. The apocrisiarius
    kyton adds its Intelligence modifier as a bonus on all damage rolls for the lancets
    (this modifier is in addition to any other damage modifiers, such as that granted
    by Strength, and is included in the statistics above). When not wielded by the
    kyton, these weapons revert to nonmagical daggers. A kyton who loses a lancet
    can withdraw a lancet from its flesh and transform the blade into a new punching
    dagger as a move action.
  Truthspeaker (Ex): An apocrisiarius kyton is incapable of lying; it can withhold
    the truth by refusing to answer a question, but can't utter or telepathically
    communicate a falsehood. Any attempts to do so (including attempts to obey commands
    to do so while the kyton is mind controlled) simply fail, as if the kyton had
    chosen not to communicate.
  Unnerving Gaze (Su): The gaze of an apocrisiarius kyton causes an opponent to become
    overwhelmed with a painfully acute awareness of all the times that lies (be they
    his own or those of others) have hurt or complicated his life. Those who fail
    to save against this effect are staggered for 1 round.
desc_long: The term “sadistic” is synonymous with kytons, who are known for their
  innate cruelty and capacity to gain pleasure from the suffering of others. However,
  an apocrisiarius kyton considers inflicting pain and suffering nothing more than
  a tool to reach what truly intrigues it-the purest form of a single truth. An apocrisiarius
  typically appears as a human whose eyes are blank, white orbs. Tears of blood weep
  from its eyes-physical evidence of the sorrow it has tasted over the ages from dreadful
  truths torn from the flesh and mind of its countless victims. The dozens of surgical
  lancets that pierce an apocrisiarius's body do the creature no harm, and the holes
  these instruments leave are as bloodless as they are deep. The kyton operates on
  those it captures with these lancets; these fiends prefer to use torture and vivisection
  to carve away both physically and metaphorically at their victims until all that
  remains is the one nugget of information they desire-a pure truth, unadulterated
  by extraneous life.
