### Special Abilities

**Adaptive Learning (Ex)** A gearsman has a number of skill points

equal to 4 + its Intelligence modifier per Hit Die, and treats

Craft and Profession as class skills. In addition, a gearsman has

a number of bonus skill ranks equal to its Hit Dice that can be

reprogrammed to apply to any one skill—these ranks can’t

be _[[universal monster rules/Split|split]]_ among multiple skills and must apply to one skill.

A gearsman can change what skill these bonus ranks apply

to up to once per day by concentrating for 1 minute, during

which time it can take no other actions. Rather than spend

these bonus ranks on a skill, a gearsman can choose to devote

them to weapon knowledge, gaining proficiency with a single

weapon instead of bonus ranks in a skill. All gearsmen are

automatically proficient with all simple weapons.

**Charge Weapon (Ex)** Any metal weapon wielded by a

gearsman becomes charged with electricity and deals 1d6

additional points of electricity damage on a hit.

**Nanite Repair (Ex)** A gearsman’s nanites _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ it, restoring a

number of hit points equal to its Hit Dice every hour (4 hit

points per hour for most gearsmen). Once per day, as a

full-round action, a gearsman can _heal_ itself or any robot it

touches of 4d6 points of damage.

##### Description

For reasons known only to themselves, gearsmen willingly

serve as _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Shock|shock]]_ troops and guards, performing their tasks

with mechanical detachment and coldly logical efficiency.

Yet they serve a purpose beyond their current directives—

an objective installed in them when they were first created.

Gearsmen disobey their putative masters whenever an

order contradicts these mysterious internal directives.

When questioned about their lapses, gearsmen answer

with only _[[spells/Silence|silence]]_.

Despite their construction, gearsmen move fluidly.

Their lack of a functional mouth doesn’t prevent them from

talking, though most speak rarely. When they do talk, they

speak with shrill, oddly distorted speech devoid of emotion

and nuance, and their voices are all eerily alike.
