  Pistols (Su): A pale stranger fights with two pistols. A pistol has a range increment
    of 20 feet and deals both bludgeoning and piercing damage. At a range of up to
    20 feet, a pale stranger's pistol attacks resolve as touch attacks. While pistols
    normally consume bullets and black powder when fired, a pale stranger's pistols
    supernaturally reload the instant it fires them, allowing the undead to make multiple
    attacks in a round with the weapons. In addition, any pistol a pale stranger wields
    functions as a +1 pistol. A pale stranger does not provoke attacks of opportunity
    when it fires a pistol in melee, and treats pistols as light weapons for the purposes
    of determining penalties from two-weapon fighting.
  Stranger's Luck (Su): A pale stranger gains a +3 luck bonus to AC and has no chance
    of misfire when using firearms.
  Stranger's Shot (Ex): As a full-round action, a pale stranger can take careful aim
    with one of its firearms and take a single, ruinous shot. This single shot always
    resolves as a touch attack, regardless of the actual range. If the pale stranger
    threatens a critical hit with this shot, it automatically confirms the critical
    hit. Regardless of whether the shot is a critical hit or not, it deals +6d6 points
    of damage.
desc_long: |-
  Sometimes death itself cannot come between a gunslinger and its final revenge. When a gunslinger is slain by a hated enemy, or murdered before it can achieve vengeance against a hated foe, the anger and wrath can animate its remains as a vengeful undead monstrosity. When a pale stranger first rises, it seeks out the source of its anger to finish the job-thereafter, it wanders the desolate parts of the world looking for new victims to vent its unending rage upon.

  A pale stranger appears much as it did in life, though desiccated and obviously undead. Rare pale strangers have the ability to hide their undead nature and appear as they did in life using veil as a constant spell-like ability (CL equals their CR). These pale strangers are often more powerful and have class levels in gunslinger or ranger, and often attract large groups of adoring bandits and followers who may or may not realize that their murderous idol is in fact an unliving horror.

  A pale stranger stands 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs 130 pounds.

##### Description

Sometimes death itself cannot come between a _[[classes/Gunslinger|gunslinger]]_ and its final revenge. When a _gunslinger_ is slain by a hated enemy, or murdered before it can achieve _[[feats/Vengeance|vengeance]]_ against a hated foe, the anger and wrath can animate its remains as a vengeful undead monstrosity. When a _pale stranger_ first rises, it seeks out the source of its anger to finish the job—thereafter, it wanders the desolate parts of the world looking for new victims to vent its unending _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ upon.

A _pale stranger_ appears much as it did in life, though desiccated and obviously undead. Rare pale strangers have the ability to hide their undead nature and appear as they did in life using _[[spells/Veil|veil]]_ as a constant spell-like ability (CL equals their CR). These pale strangers are often more powerful and have class levels in _gunslinger_ or _[[classes/Ranger|ranger]]_, and often attract large groups of adoring bandits and followers who may or may not realize that their murderous idol is in fact an unliving horror.

A _pale stranger_ stands 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs 130 pounds.
