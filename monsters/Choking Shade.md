  Create Spawn (Su): A humanoid creature killed by suffocation resulting from a choking
    shade's gravedust attack rises as a choking spirit in 1d4 rounds.
  Desperation (Su): A choking shade exudes an aura of desperation associated with
    its suffocating death, causing all creatures within 30 feet to become shaken as
    long as they remain in this area. A creature struck by the shade's incorporeal
    touch must also save against this effect. Once a creature is affected, it remains
    shaken as long as it remains within 30 feet of the choking shade. This fear effect
    does not stack with other fear effects. A successful DC 17 Will save negates the
    effect. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Gravedust (Su): As a standard action, a choking shade can enter the lungs of an
    adjacent living creature that is under the influence of a fear effect (such as
    the effect brought on by its desperation aura), bringing with it the dust of the
    grave. The victim can resist this attack with a successful DC 16 Fortitude save,
    and the choking shade is instantly expelled from a victim's lungs as soon as the
    victim is no longer under the effect of a fear effect (for example, because the
    victim has left the radius of the choking shade's aura or succeeded on the Will
    save). Until that point, the victim is prevented from breathing or speaking while
    the undead occupies its lungs. A creature can attempt to cough the shade out of
    its lungs on its turn as a standard action, but it must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude
    save to do so. See the Environmental Rules for how long a victim can hold its
    breath and the consequences of eventual suffocation.
  Susceptible to Wind (Ex): A choking shade is treated as a Tiny corporeal creature
    for the purposes of determining the effects high wind has upon it.
desc_long: |-
  There is nothing quite like the desperation of a suffocating creature, frantic for one last, sweet breath of air to fill deprived, aching lungs; it is a terrible way to die. There are so many ways to die of suffocation: asphyxiation in a fire, being buried alive, crucifixion, disease, drowning, strangulation-the list seems endless. Sometimes, the terrible imminence filling a person as life ends in so cruel a manner is enough to cause the doomed soul to rise from death as a choking shade.

   Choking shades animate into a swirling swarm of ashes, bone shards, dirt, and dust, assuming a facsimile of a humanoid form. They have a brutish intelligence and are drawn with envy to the breath of living creatures, attacking them on sight. In addition to the dust of the grave, these hateful spirits carry with them the overwhelming fear that accompanied them in their suffocating deaths, and this aura infects those who are near them with this same terror. Choking shades can take advantage of those affected by their fearful auras (or those already under the influence of a fear effect): they enter the victim's lungs, carrying their dusty remains with them, threatening unwilling hosts with the same awful deaths that they endured. Anyone slain by the choking essence of these undead creatures rises as one of their number, seeking retribution for all who are still afforded the freedom to breathe, a luxury taken for granted by the living.

   Though choking shades have some measure of intelligence and understand the languages they knew in life, their unreasoning hatred of the living makes communication with them impossible: these spirits would much rather make even a futile assault on the lungs of the living than engage in any form of communication.

##### Description

There is nothing quite like the desperation of a suffocating creature, frantic for one last, sweet breath of air to fill deprived, aching lungs; it is a terrible way to die. There are so many ways to die of _suffocation_: asphyxiation in a fire, being buried alive, crucifixion, disease, drowning, strangulation—the list seems endless. Sometimes, the terrible imminence filling a person as life ends in so _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_ a manner is enough to cause the doomed soul to rise from death as a _choking shade_.

Choking _[[spells/Shades|shades]]_ animate into a swirling swarm of ashes, bone shards, dirt, and dust, assuming a facsimile of a humanoid form. They have a brutish intelligence and are drawn with envy to the breath of living creatures, attacking them on sight. In addition to the dust of the grave, these hateful spirits carry with them the overwhelming _fear_ that accompanied them in their suffocating deaths, and this aura infects those who are near them with this same terror. Choking _shades_ can take advantage of those affected by their fearful auras (or those already under the influence of a _fear_ effect): they enter the victim’s lungs, carrying their dusty remains with them, threatening unwilling hosts with the same awful deaths that they endured. Anyone slain by the choking essence of these undead creatures rises as one of their number, seeking _[[spells/Retribution|retribution]]_ for all who are still afforded the _[[spells/Freedom|freedom]]_ to breathe, a luxury taken for granted by the living.

Though choking _shades_ have some measure of intelligence and understand the languages they knew in life, their unreasoning hatred of the living makes communication with them impossible: these spirits would much rather make even a futile assault on the lungs of the living than engage in any form of communication.
