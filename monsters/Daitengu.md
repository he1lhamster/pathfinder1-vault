### Special Abilities

**Ascetic Master (Ex)** A _daitengu_ can use unarmed strikes, flurry of blows, and _Stunning Fist_ as a 12th-level _monk_. He adds his Wisdom bonus to his AC and CMD, and gains an additional +1 bonus to AC and CMD for every four Hit Dice he has. He can treat unarmed attacks as cold iron, magic, silver, or any alignment for overcoming _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_.

**_Daitengu_’s Blessing (Su)** Once per week as a standard action, a _daitengu_ can bestow its mastery of greater fighting arts upon a creature it touches. The _daitengu_ selects any combat feat that it knows and that its target meets the prerequisites for. Upon being touched, the target gains that feat as a bonus feat for a number of days equal to the _daitengu_’s Hit Dice. A _daitengu_ with 15 or more Hit Dice can grant two feats with this ability, while a _daitengu_ with 20 or more Hit Dice can grant three.

Some say the first daitengus arose from the spirits of tengus who didn’t deserve punishment in the afterlife, but who also _[[items/Mundane/Saw|saw]]_ no appeal in the afterlife’s rewards.

A _daitengu_ stands 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. Daitengus’ most prominent features include bright red skin, crow-like wings, and prodigious noses.
