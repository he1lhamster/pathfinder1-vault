special_abilities:
  Earth Mastery (Ex): A earth elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls
    if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or
    waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These
    modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating
    or resisting these kinds of attacks.
  Petrify (Su): If it hits a target with a slam attack, a mythic earth elemental can
    expend two uses of mythic power to permanently turn that target to stone. If the
    target succeeds at a DC 23 Fortitude save, it is slowed (as the spell) for 1d6
    rounds instead of petrified. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Stun (Ex): If a mythic earth elemental strikes an opponent with two slams in 1 round,
    that creature must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d6 rounds.
    The save DC is Strength-based.
  Trap Weapon (Ex): A mythic earth elemental's body traps manufactured weapons that
    damage it. A manufactured weapon that deals hit point damage to the elemental
    (after subtracting its DR) is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds at a DC 30
    Reflex save. A creature can spend a standard action to attempt a DC 30 Strength
    check to remove a stuck weapon. Weapons that deal only bludgeoning damage are
    immune to this ability. The elemental can release any number of stuck weapons
    as a free action. The save DC is Strength-based.
desc_long: Infused with the power and wisdom of the deepest, oldest stone, a mythic
  elder earth elemental is a rocky bulwark against progress and change. They use innate
  magic and their very bodies to block enemy advances and preserve treasures of the
  earth.

 Earth elementals are plodding, stubborn creatures made of living stone or earth. When utterly still, they resemble a heap of stone or a small hill.

When an earth elemental lumbers into action, its actual appearance can vary, although its statistics remain identical to other elementals of its size. Most earth elementals look like terrestrial animals made out of rock, earth, or even crystal, with glowing gemstones for eyes. Larger earth elementals often have a stony humanoid appearance. Bits of vegetation frequently grow in the soil that makes up parts of an earth elemental’s body.
