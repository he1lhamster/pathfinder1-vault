  Change Shape (Su): As a full-round action, a raktavarna can take the shape of a
    handheld object, most often an ornamental light, a one-handed weapon, or a piece
    of treasure. If the rakshasa remains stationary in such a form, it can attempt
    Stealth checks even while being observed. It can remain motionless in object form
    indefinitely, but reverts to its true form as soon as it takes any action.
  Master's Eyes (Su): A raktavarna can designate a single creature as its master as
    a standard action. If the raktavarna is a spellcaster's familiar, its master is
    automatically that spellcaster, and the raktavarna cannot change this. As a full-round
    action, a raktavarna's master can observe the world as if looking through the
    raktavarna's eyes. The master must concentrate to maintain this link each round.
    The master's visual senses are suppressed for this time, and he uses the raktavarna's
    darkvision, detect magic, and regular eyesight to observe the world. This ability
    has no limit on range, and functions even across planar boundaries. If the raktavarna
    is slain while its master is using this ability, the master is stunned for 1d4
    rounds (no save).
  Poison (Su): Bite-injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect
    1d2 Wis plus modify memory; cure 1 save. Each time a victim takes Wisdom damage
    from this poison, a modify memory effect causes the victim to forget the previous
    minute's interactions with the raktavarna, as long as the raktavarna is no longer
    visible or is in object form. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
  Made up of smoke, blood, and gold, raktavarnas are the least of the rakshasas-they are born not from humanoids, but from the souls of rakshasas who failed utterly in their previous incarnation and who are thus reborn from a serpent's egg.

  These terrors drift through society, passing from hand to hand as weapons or strange tokens from foreign lands, curiosities brought home by traders and emissaries and given to leaders as tribute. In this manner the raktavarnas gain entry into corridors of power throughout the world, and what they see, their foul masters know. A raktavarna's servitude to a master ends only when its master decrees, or (more commonly) upon the master's death. Little disconcerts raktavarnas more than having no master, and when they are cast adrift in this manner, they seek a replacement as soon as they can.

  A 7th-level lawful evil spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can gain a raktavarna rakshasa as a familiar.

### Special Abilities

**_Change Shape_ (Su)** As a full-round action, a raktavarna can take the shape of a handheld object, most often an ornamental light, a one-handed weapon, or a piece of treasure. If the _rakshasa_ remains stationary in such a form, it can attempt Stealth checks even while being observed. It can remain motionless in object form indefinitely, but reverts to its _[[spells/True Form|true form]]_ as soon as it takes any action.

**Master’s Eyes (Su)** A raktavarna can designate a single creature as its master as a standard action. If the raktavarna is a spellcaster’s familiar, its master is automatically that spellcaster, and the raktavarna cannot change this. As a full-round action, a raktavarna’s master can observe the world as if looking through the raktavarna’s eyes. The master must concentrate to maintain this link each round. The master’s visual senses are suppressed for this time, and he uses the raktavarna’s _darkvision_, _detect magic_, and regular eyesight to observe the world. This ability has no limit on range, and functions even across _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Planar|planar]]_ boundaries. If the raktavarna is slain while its master is using this ability, the master is _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_ for 1d4 rounds (no save).

**Poison (Su)** Bite—injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Wis plus _[[spells/Modify Memory|modify memory]]_; cure 1 save. Each time a victim takes Wisdom damage from this poison, a _modify memory_ effect causes the victim to forget the previous minute’s interactions with the raktavarna, as long as the raktavarna is no longer visible or is in object form. The save DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

Made up of smoke, blood, and gold, raktavarnas are the least of the rakshasas—they are born not from humanoids, but from the souls of rakshasas who failed utterly in their previous incarnation and who are thus reborn from a serpent’s egg.

These terrors drift through society, passing from hand to hand as weapons or strange tokens from foreign lands, curiosities brought home by traders and emissaries and given to leaders as tribute. In this manner the raktavarnas gain entry into corridors of power throughout the world, and what they see, their foul masters know. A raktavarna’s servitude to a master ends only when its master decrees, or (more commonly) upon the master’s death. Little disconcerts raktavarnas more than having no master, and when they are cast adrift in this manner, they seek a replacement as soon as they can.

A 7th-level lawful evil spellcaster with the _[[feats/Improved Familiar|Improved Familiar]]_ feat can gain a raktavarna _rakshasa_ as a familiar.
