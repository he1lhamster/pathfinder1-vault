    lapping up the blood from wounded creatures nearby. Every round a clawbat may
    choose either a creature it attacks or any creature it passes adjacent to as it
    moves. If the target is at less than full hit points, it must make a DC 11 Fortitude
    save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

Clawbats, or einchadu, as they’re known to the tribes of greater Iobaria, haunt the desolate expanses of northeastern Avistan and the rugged lands beyond. Swarming forth from their shadowy dens to hunt by night, these strange predators thirst for blood, scavenging from the victims of greater nocturnal hunters and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Stalking|stalking]]_ those foolish enough not to _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ dangers in the dark. Drawn by the _scent_ of spilled blood, clawbats fearlessly follow _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ beasts, and more than one traveler has narrowly escaped a predator’s nearly lethal ambush only to find his luck change as a swarm of wings and eyes descend upon him.

The span of an average _clawbat_’s dual pairs of wings stretches 3 feet wide, lifting aloft rubbery bodies weighing 2 to 4 pounds. Tales of more monstrous clawbats, with wings that _[[spells/Blot|blot]]_ out the stars as they swoop away with children and small animals, also pass through the civilized lands of Iobaria. Such overgrown clawbats might be constructed by making use of the giant creature simple template.
