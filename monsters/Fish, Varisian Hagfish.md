  Slime Cloud (Ex): While underwater, as a free action, a Varisian hagfish can secrete
    slime that transforms a 5-foot cube of water into a transparent cloud of viscous
    slime. This slime is the aquatic equivalent of rough terrain, and creatures swimming
    through it expend 2 squares of movement. The slime cloud remains for 10 rounds
    before dissipating. Hagfish are unaffected by these slime clouds. The slime also
    grants the hagfish a +4 bonus on grapple checks.
desc_long: These cousins to normal hagfish most commonly appear in the Varisian Gulf.
  They can reach lengths of 4 feet and weigh up to 15 pounds.
