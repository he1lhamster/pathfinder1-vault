# Daemon, Sangudaemon
This human-sized, serpent-headed spider seems to be made of

clotted blood, its dragonfly-like wings dripping crimson streamers.

##### Ecology

**Environment** any (Abaddon)
**Organization** solitary, cluster (2–5), or hunt (6–10)
**Treasure** standard

### Special Abilities

**Augmented Critical (Ex)** A sangudaemon’s bite threatens a critical hit on a roll of 18–20 and deals ×3 damage on a confirmed critical hit.

**Bleeding Aura (Su)** Blood gushes from wounds at an increased rate when within 30 feet of a sangudaemon. All _bleed_ effects deal 2 additional points of damage (this bonus is included in the daemon’s _bleed_ damage). _[[spells/Heal|Heal]]_ checks to stop bleeding or stabilize a _[[conditions/Dying|dying]]_ creature, Constitution checks to become _[[conditions/Stable|stable]]_, and saving throws against effects that deal _bleed_ damage take a –4 penalty.

**Contagious Gore (Su)** Any creature that stops a _bleed_ effect created by a sangudaemon must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or gain a _bleed_ effect identical to what the creature just stopped (this has no effect if the creature was stopping a _bleed_ effect on itself). A creature that succeeds at this save is immune to this ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Drain Soul (Su)** A sangudaemon can revitalize itself by draining souls. The target must be a dead creature the daemon dealt _bleed_ damage to or used its _blood drain_ ability on within the last hour, and can have been dead for no longer than 1 minute. As a full-round action, the daemon can drink the creature’s soul dry, condemning it to Abaddon as one of the hunted (though the dead creature can be returned to life as normal). The daemon gains _[[universal monster rules/Fast Healing|fast healing]]_ 2 for a number of rounds equal to the Hit Dice of the creature whose soul was drained.

##### Description

Sangudaemons personify death by blood loss. Perhaps more so than any other caste of daemon, the sangudaemon enjoys the hunt for prey, whether that prey is _[[monsters/Petitioner|petitioner]]_, mortal, or anything else that bleeds. That the souls of those who perish to a sangudaemon’s wrath are consigned to Abaddon makes these daemons particularly hated by those who hold the supernatural cycle of the soul’s journey _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sacred|sacred]]_. A sangudaemon is about 5 feet long and weighs 200 pounds.
