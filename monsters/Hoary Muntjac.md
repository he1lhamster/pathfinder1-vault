  Hibernal Breath (Su): Once per day, a hoary muntjac can exhale a 15-foot cone of
    icy mist as a standard action. Characters caught in the cloud take 2d4 points
    of cold damage and are fatigued. A DC 14 Fortitude save halves the damage and
    negates the fatigue. Creatures that don't breathe and creatures that don't sleep
    (including elves) are immune to this ability, as are other hoary muntjac. The
    save DC is Constitution-based.
  Shoveler (Ex): A hoary muntjac can move over snow or ice at its normal speed and
    heavy snow at half-speed (instead of one-quarter).
  Track Heat (Ex): A hoary muntjac gains a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Survival checks
    in cold weather (below 40º). This bonus increases to +8 in severe cold (below
    0º).
desc_long: |-
  Hoary muntjac are a carnivorous offshoot of the deer family. Owing to the bloodstains often seen on their muzzles, they are also known as red-nosed elk.

  The body of a hoary muntjac differs little from that of a reindeer or elk. Its head, however, is that of a wolflike predator, with forward-facing eyes, sharp ears, and long canines. The hoary muntjac's stubby antlers are barely noticeable amid its thick fur, which is more akin to a shaggy wolf 's pelt than a deer's hide.

  Hoary muntjac hunt in packs but squabble over food once caught. Hoary muntjac prefer warm meat but can survive for short stretches on mountain scrub.

  Environment: Hoary muntjac roam mountain and sub-arctic terrain. In contrast to most animals, hoary muntjac hunt primarily during the snowy season and estivate when the spring thaw comes. Their heat tracking allows them to find prey both active and torpid.

  Typical Physical Characteristics: Hoary muntjac stand about 5 feet at the shoulder, although a truly monstrous bull might reach 7 feet. They weigh 500 lb.
