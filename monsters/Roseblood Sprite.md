  Level Adjustment +2Special AbilitiesPoison Thorns (Ex) Roseblood sprites typically carry a number of poison thorns with them, usable in their thorn bows. These thorns carry an irritating toxin known as the red rash. This poison has an initial effect of forcing the target to spend 1 round itching and scratching the wound, incapable of taking any other action (treat as dazed). The secondary effect of the poison is 1d2 points of Strength damage. A DC 14 Fortitude save negates these effects.

  Rose Form (Su) A roseblood sprite can, as a standard action, take the form of a Small rose bush. While in this form, the roseblood sprite is immobile but it can perceive its surroundings. It can take no actions other than to revert to sprite form (a free action). Any damage dealt to the bush is applied to the sprite while in this form (AC 6). A roseblood sprite is susceptible to any spell or effects that target plants while in this form, but it is immune to critical hits and sneak attack damage. A roseblood sprite in rose form automatically fails all Reflex saves. A roseblood sprite can assume the form of a rose bush any number of times per day and can maintain the form indefinitely.

  Sneak Attack (Ex) This ability functions just like the rogue ability of the same name, allowing the sprite to deal an additional 1d6 points of damage when attacking a flat-footed or flanked foe. If a roseblood sprite takes levels in a class that grants sneak attack damage (such as a rogue) it stacks with this ability.

  Woodland Stride (Su) This ability functions just like the druid ability of the same name, allowing the sprite to move through any sort of undergrowth (such as rose bushses) at normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.DescriptionKnown for their cruelty and disdain for humanoid creatures, rose blood sprites are the embodiment of nature's uncaring and vengeful aspects. Roseblood sprites act out against those who would despoil nature's beauty, often with excessive force. All too often, even the presence of such an outsider is enough to provoke their ire, be it human, orc, or even elf (although they seem to forgive the presence of fey-allied gnomes).

  The origins of the roseblood sprites are lost to time, but their legends hold that they formed from the petals of the world's first rose, whose wicked thorns protected its beauty. The legend goes on to say that these first roseblood sprites were all crowned king by Gozreh and taught the secrets of awakening more of their kin. Whether or not this limits the total number of roseblood kings is not known, but sages speculate that when one dies, another is crowned.

  Roseblood sprites tend to organize themselves into courtly strata, with dukes, barons, and earls all vying for their king's attention. These titles seem to mean little to the king, but individual sprites often attack those who misuse or disregard their rank.

  Roseblood sprites reproduce through an odd ritual involving their king, by which a pair of sprites both assume their bush form side by side for one full year. At the end ofthat time, a third smaller rose bush has grown up between them. This bush is tended by the king and its parents and once it reaches maturity, it is transformed by the king. This last step is a closely guarded secret that involves the king whispering ancient words into the flowering bush.

##### Description

Known for their _cruelty_ and disdain for humanoid creatures, rose blood sprites are the embodiment of nature's uncaring and vengeful aspects. Roseblood sprites act out against those who would despoil nature's beauty, often with excessive force. All too often, even the presence of such an outsider is enough to provoke their ire, be it human, _[[monsters/Orc|orc]]_, or even elf (although they seem to forgive the presence of fey-allied gnomes).

The origins of the roseblood sprites are lost to time, but their legends hold that they formed from the petals of the world's first rose, whose wicked thorns protected its beauty. The legend goes on to say that these first roseblood sprites were all crowned _[[npcs/King|king]]_ by Gozreh and taught the secrets of awakening more of their kin. Whether or not this limits the total number of roseblood kings is not known, but sages speculate that when one dies, another is crowned.

Roseblood sprites tend to organize themselves into courtly strata, with dukes, barons, and earls all vying for their _king_'s attention. These titles seem to mean little to the _king_, but individual sprites often attack those who misuse or disregard their rank.

Roseblood sprites reproduce through an odd ritual involving their _king_, by which a pair of sprites both assume their bush form side by side for one full year. At the end ofthat time, a third smaller rose bush has grown up between them. This bush is tended by the _king_ and its parents and once it reaches maturity, it is transformed by the _king_. This last step is a closely guarded secret that involves the _king_ whispering ancient words into the flowering bush.
