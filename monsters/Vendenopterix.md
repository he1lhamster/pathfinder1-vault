  Ability Drain (Su): A vendenopterix drains energy from a mortal she lures into an
    act of passion, such as a kiss. An unwilling victim must be grappled before the
    vendenopterix can use this ability. The vendenopterix's kiss inflicts 1 point
    of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma drain (her choice). The kiss also has the
    effect of a suggestion spell, asking the victim to accept another act of passion
    from the vendenopterix. The target must succeed at a DC 15 Will save to negate
    the suggestion. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Poison (Ex): Claw-injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect
    1d2 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based, and
    includes a +2 racial bonus.
  Swift Tracker (Ex): A vendenopterix can move at her normal speed while using Survival
    to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty
    (instead of the normal -20 penalty) when moving at up to twice her normal speed
    while tracking.
desc_long: Beautiful, seductive, and ruthless, vendenopterixes are servitors of Calistria
  tasked with hunting down and punishing enemies of the faith. Though they typically
  take female form, vendenopterixes are comfortable taking the shape of any gendered
  humanoid (including polygendered creatures) but avoid genderless shapes. A vendenopterix's
  purpose is to punish, but not necessarily to kill. She may be tasked with exposing
  a creature's secrets or convincing a creature to do so itself in an embarrassing
  way, and she is just as likely to drain her victim's mental facilities until it
  acts like a buffoon or clod as she is to poison her target so it appears to be aff
  licted with (or even dying from) a venereal pox. Vendenopterixes stand about 6 feet
  tall and range in weight from a slender 140 pounds to a curvaceous 240.

Beautiful, seductive, and ruthless, vendenopterixes are servitors of Calistria tasked with hunting down and punishing enemies of the faith.

A _vendenopterix_’s purpose is to punish, but not necessarily to kill. She may be tasked with exposing a creature’s secrets or convincing a creature to do so itself in an embarrassing way, and she is just as likely to drain her victim’s mental facilities until it acts like a buffoon or clod as she is to poison her target so it appears to be aff licted with (or even _[[conditions/Dying|dying]]_ from) a venereal pox. Vendenopterixes stand about 6 feet tall and range in weight from a slender 140 pounds to a curvaceous 240.
