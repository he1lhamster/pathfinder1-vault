  Manipulate Path (Su): As a standard action, a dosojin can alter the structure and
    stability of its ward, making travel along its road or trail either easier or
    harder for specific groups of travelers. Helping travelers in this way makes a
    dosojin's ward sturdier and more straightforward, allowing creatures to reach
    their destination in half the time they would normally take (though this does
    not grant a bonus to creatures' movement speeds in combat). If a dosojin instead
    chooses to hinder travelers, it creates unexpected twists and turns within its
    ward, turning the path into difficult terrain and so causing travelers to take
    twice as long as they normally would to reach their destination. These effects
    last as long as the targets stay within the boundaries of the dosojin's ward.
  Mimic Statue (Su): As a standard action, a dosojin can assume the appearance of
    any Medium-sized statue, such as a stone marker, a religious icon, or a sculpture
    carved into the side of a cliff. A dosojin's body is hard and has the texture
    of rough stone no matter what appearance it takes. A dosojin gains a +20 racial
    bonus on Disguise checks when imitating a statue in this manner.
desc_long: |-
  Dosojins are kami that take the form of stone icons and watch over roads and trails. They are often found in statue form at the edges of villages, along mountain passes, at the beginnings of tunnels and other major works of roadway construction, or at simple country crossroads. In urban areas, dosojins can sometimes be found on street corners and near bridges. They serve as the guardians of travelers, keeping the malicious and malevolent off the paths they diligently watch over. Wise travelers know to seek a dosojin's blessing before traveling upon its ward, for falling out of favor with the kami of travel is a sure way to become lost or hampered. Pious mortal couples also seek out dosojin for their own reasons, as the kami are often regarded as patrons of fertility, and are known for their habit of choosing mates and standing beside one another for their entire lives. In many regions, the blessing of a dosojin is believed to ensure a long and happy marriage, as well as many healthy children.

  The average dosojin stands about 4-1/2 feet tall and weighs upward of 400 pounds.

##### Description

Dosojins are kami that take the form of stone icons and watch over roads and trails. They are often found in _statue_ form at the edges of villages, along mountain passes, at the beginnings of tunnels and other major works of roadway construction, or at simple country crossroads. In urban areas, dosojins can sometimes be found on street corners and near bridges. They serve as the guardians of travelers, keeping the malicious and _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Malevolent|malevolent]]_ off the paths they diligently watch over. Wise travelers know to seek a dosojin’s blessing before traveling upon its ward, for falling out of favor with the kami of travel is a sure way to become lost or hampered. Pious mortal couples also seek out dosojin for their own reasons, as the kami are often regarded as patrons of fertility, and are known for their habit of choosing mates and standing beside one another for their entire lives. In many regions, the blessing of a dosojin is believed to ensure a long and happy marriage, as well as many healthy children.

The average dosojin stands about 4-1/2 feet tall and weighs upward of 400 pounds.
