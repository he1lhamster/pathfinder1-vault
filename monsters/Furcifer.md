### Special Abilities

**Deleriant Aura (Ex)** A _[[monsters/Furcifer|furcifer]]_’s pollen induces euphoria and

_[[spells/Confusion|confusion]]_, imposing a –2 penalty on Will saving throws

on any creatures within 50 feet of the _furcifer_. Creatures

immune to poison are immune to this effect.

**_Displacement_ (Su)** A _furcifer_’s illusory pollen constantly

distorts its presence. It gains a 50% miss chance as if it

had total concealment. Unlike actual total concealment,

_displacement_ does not prevent enemies from targeting the

creature normally. _[[spells/True Seeing|True seeing]]_ reveals its true location and

negates the miss chance, and creatures immune to illusions

or poison are immune to this effect.

**Tongue (Ex)** A _furcifer_ can _[[universal monster rules/Grab|grab]]_ a foe with its tongue and

draw the victim to its mouth. This tongue attack has a

reach of 25 feet. The attack deals no damage but allows

the _furcifer_ to _grab_ its target. A _furcifer_ does not gain the

_[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ condition while using its tongue in this manner.

**Utopia (Sp)** A _furcifer_ is _[[feats/Blessed|blessed]]_ with strange powers of

illusion and can warp the world around it at will to seem

idyllic and safe. This functions as a _[[spells/Mirage Arcana|mirage arcana]]_ spell,

though the _furcifer_’s simplistic intellect means it may create

unusual or surreal illusions based on what its victims find

appealing. Creatures in the affected area may recognize

the landscape as unnatural with a successful DC 20 Will

saving throw; otherwise, the _furcifer_’s powers lull them

into accepting the impossible. Affected creatures cannot

recognize any natural hazards in the area, and the _furcifer_

itself appears as something harmless within the affected

area, such as a flower-covered hill, quaint home, or friendly

animal, making it effectively _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_; if the _furcifer_

attacks, it immediately breaks the _[[spells/Invisibility|invisibility]]_ effect but

does not end the _mirage arcana_ effect. Creatures immune

to illusions and mind-affecting effects are immune to this

effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

##### Description

Standing as tall as a house and draped in intoxicating

blossoms, the _furcifer_ is a bizarre synthesis of reptile

and plant born from enormous surges of positive

energy. Despite their inviting, vibrant hides, furcifers

are _[[curses/Ravenous|ravenous]]_ predators, capable of warping the world

around them into almost any placid scene and concealing

themselves from ordinary senses. These abilities make

them extraordinary ambush predators, and parties of

human-sized travelers are easily picked off one by one

from above thanks to the clever reptilian hunters’ long,

_[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Prehensile|prehensile]]_ _[[spells/Tongues|tongues]]_.

Lazy and patient, these large reptiles sometimes lull

whole caravans into complacency, letting them linger in

false wonderlands for days or weeks as the _furcifer_ picks

off its prey one at a time. Furcifers are cantankerous and

stubborn, and dispense with all subtlety to pursue prey

relentlessly if it escapes their illusory paradise.

Furcifers on average stand over 15 feet tall and 35 feet

long thanks to their long, curled tails. Furcifers weigh up

to 6-1/2 tons.
