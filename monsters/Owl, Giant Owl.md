    most giant owls) on its initiative checks.
  Piercing Stare (Su): Up to three times per day as a swift action, a giant owl can
    gain the effects of true seeing (as the spell) for 1 round.

  it doesn't observe directly, it learns from its wide network of animal informants.
  Giant owls view themselves more as watchers than participants, rarely interfering
  in the affairs of others barring a threat to their homes. Giant owls stand 18 feet
  tall and have 30-foot wingspans, yet they rarely weigh over 600 pounds.
