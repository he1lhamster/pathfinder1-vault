  Ant Affinity (Su): Ants will never attack a nuno. A nuno can control ants and ant
    swarms as a druid's wild empathy, with a +4 racial bonus on their checks. While
    ants are normally mindless, the nuno imparts to them a modicum of implanted intelligence,
    allowing nunos to train ants to perform tasks as necessary to suit the nunos'
    fancies.
  Nuno's Curse (Su): A nuno can curse any creature it touches unless the creature
    succeeds at a DC 14 Will save. A creature that harms the nuno, damages the nuno's
    home, or steals the nuno's belongings must also save against the curse with a
    -2 penalty. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to that nuno's curse
    for 24 hours. A creature under the effects of the nuno's curse experiences horrific
    swelling and hair growth in a location the nuno touched or that was associated
    with harming the nuno (for instance, a creature's foot if that creature kicked
    over the nuno's anthill). This swelling imparts a -2 penalty to Dexterity and
    causes the affected area to occasionally ooze or expel black pus. The DC to remove
    a nuno's curse with spells and abilities like remove curse is 10 higher than normal
    (24 for a typical nuno). A nuno can remove its curse as a standard action, and
    when a nuno dies, all its active curses end immediately. The effects of multiple
    nuno's curses don't stack. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Wax Locator (Su): Any creature cursed by a nuno can spend 1 minute pouring molten
    wax into a spoon and then into a container of water, causing the wax to run in
    the direction of the nuno. This allows the accursed creature to find the nuno
    no matter where it hides and attempt to put an end to the curse.
desc_long: |-
  Nunos are fungus gremlins that live in anthills. Even young nunos appear as wizened old men, and the creatures are solitary hermits, living among ants in anthills and burrows in tropical regions. Though nunos are as spiteful as any other gremlins, they tend to keep to themselves and reserve their enmity for those who bother them-especially those who dare to harm a nuno's anthill home.

  Due to the relative difficulty of removing a nuno's curse via magic, the best options for a creature cursed by a nuno are to slay the nuno or parley with the creature. Since the curse could have triggered while the nuno wasn't present, both approaches are made easier by the nuno's wax locator ability. Though inherently grumpy, nunos are easily bribed with offerings of fruit or valuable objects, and can at times be swayed by a particularly well-constructed argument. They can also usually be persuaded by humanoids and fey they find beautiful, though a nuno's predilections are unpredictable at best, and they tend to loathe conventional beauty.

##### Description

Nunos are fungus gremlins that live in anthills. Even young nunos appear as wizened old men, and the creatures are solitary hermits, living among ants in anthills and burrows in tropical regions. Though nunos are as _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Spiteful|spiteful]]_ as any other gremlins, they tend to keep to themselves and reserve their enmity for those who bother them—especially those who dare to _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ a nuno’s anthill home.

Due to the relative difficulty of removing a nuno’s curse via magic, the best options for a creature cursed by a nuno are to slay the nuno or parley with the creature. Since the curse could have triggered while the nuno wasn’t present, both approaches are made easier by the nuno’s wax locator ability. Though inherently grumpy, nunos are easily bribed with offerings of fruit or valuable objects, and can at times be swayed by a particularly well-constructed argument. They can also usually be persuaded by humanoids and fey they find beautiful, though a nuno’s predilections are unpredictable at best, and they tend to loathe conventional beauty.
