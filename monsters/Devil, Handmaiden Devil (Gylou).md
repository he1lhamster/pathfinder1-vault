    whole. The gylou's tentacles are AC 17 and have 18 hp for the purpose of an entrapped
    creature cutting itself out. A gylou's tendrils heal quickly, allowing her to
    use this ability 1 round after a creature cuts itself free.

  Known as handmaiden devils, Mothers of Pain, and Maids of Miscarriage, gylous attend to the whims and schemes of Hell's few female overlords. Like manipulative matrons amid decadent mortal courts, these deceivers hide their fathomless evil beneath illusions of beauty, graciousness, and tradition. Gylous particularly loathe children. It's said that the persistent cry of a babe can sometimes cause these fiends to abandon their illusions and viciously attack. 

  As greater devils, gylous can command many lesser devils, yet harbor an exclusive favoritism for erinyes. A gylou weighs 160 pounds and stands stiffly at 5-1/2 feet-though many wear their head-sprouting tentacles in tall, elaborate coiffures.
