  Tearing Bite (Ex): A dimetrodon's jaws are filled with razor-sharp teeth of two
    different sizes. This gives the creature a threat range of 19-20 with its bite
    attack.
desc_long: |-
  A dimetrodon is a quadrupedal reptile similar in shape to a crocodile, but with a blunter snout filled with jagged, sharp teeth. Its most distinguishing feature is the massive sail that runs the length of its back. By extending or contracting the fin, the cold-blooded reptile can control its body temperature with ease. While they are not technically dinosaurs, dimetrodons are still often found dwelling in regions inhabited by such creatures.

  A fully grown adult dimetrodon can reach a length of up to 15 feet and weigh upward of 2,000 pounds.
