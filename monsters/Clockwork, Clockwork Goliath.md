  Cannon (Ex): One of a goliath's arms ends in a cannon. The goliath may use this
    as one of its four slam attacks, or it can use it to fire cannonballs. A cannon
    has a range increment of 100 feet, and deals 6d6 points of bludgeoning and piercing
    damage on a hit with a ×4 critical modifier. A clockwork goliath's cannon can
    hold up to 12 cannonballs-reloading a single cannonball is a standard action.
  Self-Destruction (Su): When a goliath's hit points are reduced to 10% its total
    (21 hp for most clockwork goliaths) or less but still above 0, it self-destructs
    on its next turn, bursting in an explosion of metal scraps and steam that deals
    12d6 points of slashing damage plus 12d6 points of fire damage to all creatures
    within a 20-foot-radius burst. A successful DC 24 Reflex save halves the damage.
    The save is Constitution-based.

  The thunderous clockwork goliath is easily recognized as the epitome of technology created to destroy. The exact nature of a clockwork goliath's “hands” varies-they all resolve as slam attacks in melee combat, though.
