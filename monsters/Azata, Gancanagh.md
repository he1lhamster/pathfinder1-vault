  Gancanagh's Grace (Su): A gancanagh's otherworldly grace and flowing movement allow
    him to add his Dexterity modifier to damage rolls with his rapier in place of
    his Strength modifier.
  Invigorating Passion (Su): A gancanagh's passion has the power to raise those who
    receive it to great heights. Any creature who performs an act of passion with
    a gancanagh, such as a kiss, gains a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls, gains
    1 bonus Hit Die (d10) with the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply
    the target's Constitution modifier, if any), and takes no penalties from the fatigued
    or exhausted conditions. These benefits last for 1 hour. At the end of that time,
    the creature must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or become fatigued, or exhausted
    if it was already fatigued. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Vulnerable to Smoke (Ex): A gancanagh's lungs can't tolerate smoke. He takes a -4
    penalty on all saving throws against smoke and cloud effects, such as stinking
    cloud and the smoke from pyrotechnics.
desc_long: |-
  Male azatas of extraordinary and radiant beauty, gancanaghs are Elysium's knights-errant, but they are best known as inveterate wooers of mortals and immortals alike. While gancanaghs are incorrigible flirts, a gancanagh's true attention tends to alight on one man or woman at a time, and he throws himself into wooing and courting his current target, into a brief but earnest fling before his quicksilver passions change yet again.

  Gancanaghs hate succubi and incubi more than anything else, as they feel that the mere existence of such creatures profanes the spirit of romance with the shadow of the demons' seduction and violence, leading good people who share the gancanagh's flirtatious and open nature to be compared to evil creatures. One can give a gancanagh no greater offense than to mistake him for an incubus, and more than one hotheaded gancanagh has challenged a misinformed paladin or other ally of good to a duel over such an insult.

  While many gancanaghs carry whimsical-looking pipes because they like the way they look, they can't stand smoke, and so rarely make use of them. A gancanagh's flute, on the other hand, is a cherished possession, as they enjoy both the beauty of the music and its ability to sway the heart. A typical gancanagh stands 6 feet tall but weighs only 130 pounds.

##### Description

Male azatas of extraordinary and _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Radiant|radiant]]_ beauty, gancanaghs are Elysium’s knights-errant, but they are best known as inveterate wooers of mortals and immortals alike. While gancanaghs are incorrigible flirts, a gancanagh’s true attention tends to alight on one man or woman at a time, and he throws himself into wooing and courting his current target, into a brief but earnest _[[feats/Fling|fling]]_ before his quicksilver passions change yet again.

Gancanaghs hate succubi and incubi more than anything else, as they feel that the mere existence of such creatures profanes the spirit of romance with the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|shadow]]_ of the demons’ seduction and violence, leading good people who share the gancanagh’s flirtatious and open nature to be compared to evil creatures. One can give a gancanagh no greater offense than to mistake him for an incubus, and more than one hotheaded gancanagh has challenged a misinformed _[[classes/Paladin|paladin]]_ or other ally of good to a duel over such an insult.

While many gancanaghs carry whimsical-looking pipes because they like the way they look, they can’t stand smoke, and so rarely make use of them. A gancanagh’s flute, on the other hand, is a cherished _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_, as they enjoy both the beauty of the music and its ability to sway the heart. A typical gancanagh stands 6 feet tall but weighs only 130 pounds.
