    space. All creatures in any of these lines take 5d6 points of piercing damage
    (Reflex DC 21 half). The save DC is Dexterity-based.
desc_long: This represents an average troop of Glorious Reclamation sergeants active

  the troop are skilled fighters, the troop contains a sufficient number of clerics
  to provide the troop with limited healing. These troops are normally outfitted with
  longswords, full plate armor, and tower shields.
