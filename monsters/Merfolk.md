##### Description

From the waist up, _merfolk_ bear the torsos of well-built humans and delicate features reminiscent of elves and other humanoids tied to the natural world. A _merfolk_’s lower body consists of the fins and tail of a great fish. Depending on the region, _[[diseases/The Scales|the scales]]_ of _merfolk_ vary in hue, including gleaming silver, pale green, or even blue with stripes of yellow and crimson. _Merfolk_ typically measure 6 to 8 feet in length and weigh over 200 pounds, with females being slightly smaller than males. Although _amphibious_, _merfolk_ move only with difficulty on land and rarely wander more than a mile from sea.

It is quite rare for a _merfolk_ to make contact with a creature not of its kind. In fact, many go to great lengths to steer sailors away from their lands, even resorting to violence if necessary. Ancient accounts hint at _merfolk_ protecting a terrible secret bound to the depths, and though no reports mention what this secret is, the lengths _merfolk_ go to remain isolated from other races highlight the importance of this safeguard.

While _merfolk_ outwardly appear to be a beautiful and powerful race, some sages and seafarers whisper that degenerate and mutated _merfolk_ roam the deepest, most isolated regions of the seas and oceans. Some evidence states that this offshoot fell to the worship of twisted and sinister powers lurking in the _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_ below, while other theories include all _merfolk_ in this sinister agenda, holding that even those _merfolk_ who believe they control their own destinies are, in fact, merely unknowing puppets of a sinister and _[[monsters/Unknown|unknown]]_ master race deep under the sea.
