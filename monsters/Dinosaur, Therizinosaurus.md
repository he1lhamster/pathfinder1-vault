    and make a great, sweeping attack with its claws against up to four adjacent foes.
    The dinosaur makes an attack roll against each target, inflicting claw damage
    on a successful hit.
  Vicious Claws (Ex): A therizinosaurus's claws threaten a critical hit on an 18-20.
desc_long: At first glance, this dinosaur's massive claws may well convince observers
  that it is a predator, but the therizinosaurus is in fact an omnivore. Nonetheless,
  the therizinosaurus has a foul temper and is both easily angered and difficult to
  spook. With its deep-cutting claws, the therizinosaurus is more than a match for
  even the mightiest of predatory dinosaurs. A therizinosaurus is 35 feet long and
  weighs 13,000 pounds.

Nonetheless, the therizinosaurus has a foul temper and is both easily angered and difficult to spook. With its deep-cutting claws, the therizinosaurus is more than a match for even the mightiest of predatory dinosaurs. A therizinosaurus is 35 feet long and weighs 13,000 pounds.
