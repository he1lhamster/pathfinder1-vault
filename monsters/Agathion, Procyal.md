  Fabricated Forgery (Su): Procyal agathions are able to flawlessly forge signatures
    and legal documents even if they have never seen them before. They can use Bluff
    in place of Linguistics when forging the signature of or a document written by
    the creature whose form they are currently assuming.
  Imitator (Su): Procyal agathions can use the change shape special quality as per
    the alter self spell, but they can assume only the forms of any specific individual
    they have met at least once. They are unable to assume any other form beyond their
    natural shape.
desc_long: |-
  Procyals are mischievous agathions who take great pride and pleasure in acting just outside the boundaries of imperfect, mortal societies. Unlike many agathions, who are born from the souls of those who seek enlightenment through self-understanding, procyals are born from those who understand the balance of society and the individual.

  Procyals view society and the individuals therein as entities in a symbiotic relationship. They believe that individuals can be truly happy or free only within a society when they have access to luxury, commerce, and choice, and that society basically exists as a structure centered on the freedom of the individuals within. It is critically important to procyals that all individuals realize that society isn't something greater than themselves, but that they are intrinsically part of it and vice versa. Procyals commonly say that “you are not in the city, you are a part of the city”-and this serves as a reminder to those they visit that every member of the community is important.

  Procyals present a far more active force than most agathions, as they understand that neither societies nor people are static; rather, they believe that both are constantly growing and changing, and so must be willing to change to attain perfection. They move about the various planes constantly, humbling the prideful, praising the meek, striking down unfair laws, and building the structures that keep society in order. They happily see their work as never truly being complete, since healthy societies are constantly growing and changing. It is the goal of all procyals for this change to always be positive.

  Procyals are exceptional shape changers, able to effortlessly take the form of humanoid creatures they have met during their travels. This change is rarely more than cosmetic, however, for procyals are not interested in impersonating the person's normal behavior. Instead, they do things geared toward the creature's ultimate good-or at least the ultimate good of that creature's community. When all is well, procyals sometimes take on particular individuals' appearances just to play goodnatured pranks on them-though never harmful ones. Some favorites include shadowing that person through town to befuddle onlookers, making public appearances in multiple places at the same time, or asking “themselves” for directions, only to watch the mimicked creature's face twist in confusion.

  Despite their ability to take on specific forms, procyals are unable to assume a humanoid form of their own invention. Instead, they choose from the forms available to them as appropriate for a given task. They may, for example, portray old crones to relay important messages or powerful mercenaries to deliver threats.

  Procyals typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh 180 pounds.

##### Description

Procyals are mischievous agathions who take great pride and pleasure in acting just outside the boundaries of imperfect, mortal societies. Unlike many agathions, who are born from the souls of those who seek enlightenment through self-understanding, procyals are born from those who understand the balance of society and the individual.

Procyals view society and the individuals therein as entities in a symbiotic relationship. They believe that individuals can be truly happy or free only within a society when they have access to luxury, commerce, and choice, and that society basically exists as a structure centered on the _[[spells/Freedom|freedom]]_ of the individuals within. It is critically important to procyals that all individuals realize that society isn’t something greater than themselves, but that they are intrinsically part of it and vice versa. Procyals commonly say that “you are not in the city, you are a part of the city”—and this serves as a reminder to those they visit that every member of the community is important.

Procyals present a far more active force than most agathions, as they understand that neither societies nor people are static; rather, they believe that both are constantly _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Growing|growing]]_ and changing, and so must be willing to change to attain perfection. They move about the various planes constantly, humbling the prideful, praising the meek, striking down unfair laws, and building the structures that keep society in order. They happily see their work as never truly being complete, since healthy societies are constantly _growing_ and changing. It is the goal of all procyals for this change to always be positive.

Procyals are exceptional shape changers, able to effortlessly take the form of humanoid creatures they have met during their travels. This change is rarely more than cosmetic, however, for procyals are not interested in impersonating the person’s normal behavior. Instead, they do things geared toward the creature’s ultimate good—or at least the ultimate good of that creature’s community. When all is well, procyals sometimes take on particular individuals’ appearances just to play goodnatured pranks on them—though never harmful ones. Some favorites include shadowing that person through town to befuddle onlookers, making public appearances in multiple places at the same time, or asking “themselves” for directions, only to watch the mimicked creature’s face twist in _[[spells/Confusion|confusion]]_.

Despite their ability to take on specific forms, procyals are unable to assume a humanoid form of their own invention. Instead, they choose from the forms available to them as appropriate for a given task. They may, for example, portray old crones to relay important messages or powerful mercenaries to deliver threats.

Procyals typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh 180 pounds.
