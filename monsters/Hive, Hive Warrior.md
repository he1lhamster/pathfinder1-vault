  Acid Spit (Ex): A hive warrior can spray acid as a ranged touch attack out to a
    maximum range of 20 feet. Creatures struck by this spray take acid damage as if
    struck by a hive creature's death throes. Additionally, creatures damaged by a
    hive warrior's acid spit continue to take the same amount of acid damage for the
    next 1d3 rounds. A successful Reflex save halves the initial damage and negates
    the ongoing damage. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  Rending Mandibles (Ex): When a hive warrior confirms a critical hit with its bite,
    it deals equal damage to the creature's armor.
desc_long: Hive warriors guard colonies and serve as scouts for suitable hosts. Warriors
  sometimes range miles from their colony and drag victims back to be cocooned by
  hive workers. Hive warriors consider symbiosis with a hive creature to be both inevitable
  and beneficial and can't fathom why most victims struggle against it. Hive workers
  have similar statistics, though they have the ability to secrete resin and sculpt
  that resin, rather than acid spit or rending mandibles.

Hive warriors _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_ colonies and serve as scouts for suitable hosts. Warriors sometimes range miles from their colony and drag victims back to be cocooned by hive workers. Hive warriors consider symbiosis with a hive creature to be both inevitable and beneficial and can’t fathom why most victims struggle against it. Hive workers have similar statistics, though they have the ability to secrete resin and sculpt that resin, rather than acid spit or rending mandibles.
