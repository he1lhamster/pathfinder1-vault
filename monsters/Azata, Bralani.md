  Whirlwind Blast (Su): When in wind form, a bralani can attack with a scouring blast
    of wind, dealing 3d6 points of damage in a 20-foot line (Reflex DC 17 half). The
    save DC is Constitution-based.
  Wind Form (Su): A bralani can shift between its humanoid body and a body made of
    wind and mist as a standard action. In humanoid form, it cannot fly or use its
    whirlwind blast. In wind form, it functions as if under the effects of a wind
    walk spell. It can make slam attacks and use spell-like abilities in either form.
    A bralani remains in one form until it chooses to assume its other form. A change
    in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the bralani revert to any particular form
    when killed (both shapes are its true form). A true seeing spell reveals both
    forms simultaneously.
desc_long: |-
  Bralanis are among the fiercest and wildest of the azatas, living from moment to moment and always on the lookout for chances to test their skill in battle. In addition to their elf-like forms, they can take the shape of whirlwinds of dust, snow, or sand. In the mortal realm, they are often mistaken for djinn. They delight in violent weather, not for the destructive qualities of such events, but for the intensity and energy, and many tales describe bralani as spirits who laugh as they sail amid the strongest storms.

  Bralanis do not need to eat, but they enjoy doing so. Most prefer elven food, fiery human dishes, and spiced wine. Because of their similarities to elementals and fey, they sometimes act as intermediaries between mortals, elementals, and fey, though they prefer to arrange temporary truces that allow the interested parties to conduct their own negotiations on neutral ground. When taking the role of mediators-or whenever else such opportunities present themselves-bralani are quick to suggest friendly competitions or games to end disputes and enjoy creating challenges or complicated contests to test both physical and mental mortal prowess.

##### Description

Bralanis are among the fiercest and wildest of the azatas, living from moment to moment and always on the _[[feats/Lookout|lookout]]_ for chances to test their skill in battle. In addition to their elf-like forms, they can take the shape of whirlwinds of dust, snow, or sand. In the mortal realm, they are often mistaken for djinn. They delight in violent weather, not for the destructive qualities of such events, but for the intensity and energy, and many tales describe bralani as spirits who laugh as they sail amid the strongest storms.

Bralanis do not need to eat, but they enjoy doing so. Most prefer elven food, fiery human dishes, and spiced wine. Because of their similarities to elementals and fey, they sometimes act as intermediaries between mortals, elementals, and fey, though they prefer to arrange temporary truces that allow the interested parties to conduct their own negotiations on neutral ground. When taking the role of mediators—or whenever else such opportunities present themselves—bralani are quick to suggest friendly competitions or games to end disputes and enjoy creating challenges or complicated contests to test both physical and mental mortal prowess.
