  Aura of Revelation (Su): A fantionette appears as an adult halfling or a human child
    (its choice) to all creatures outside of its aura. This is an illusion (glamer)
    effect that can be bypassed only by  or similar magic. A creature within a fantionette's
    aura that is studying or interacting with it can attempt a DC 15 Will save to
    perceive the outsider for what it truly is. A creature that succeeds at this save
    or that is attacked by a fantionette immediately sees the fantionette's true form
    for the next 24 hours, even while outside the aura. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Puppet Strings (Su): Once per day as an immediate action, a fantionette can relinquish
    control of itself, letting a higher entity (presumably Thamir Gixx) gain control.
    When it does this, a fantionette can perform one of the following special actions.
    Make an extra attack as part of a standard action. Move up to its speed. The fantionette
    loses its move action on its next turn. Reroll a single roll after it was made,
    but before the results are determined.
desc_long: |-
  A fantionette is a servitor outsider for the halfling deity Thamir Gixx. It embodies the halfling god's association with assassination and opportunity, presenting itself to loyal followers of the Silent Blade both as a powerful assassin and as impressive support for established murderers. When left to its own devices on the Material Plane, a fantionette is a terrifying stalker of halflings and humans alike, positioning itself among large groups of human children or halflings and selecting adult targets to murder based entirely on whim and opportunity.

   A fantionette stands between 3 and 4 feet high and weighs about 70 pounds.
