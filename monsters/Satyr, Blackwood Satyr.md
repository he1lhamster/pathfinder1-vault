special_abilities:
  Incorrigible Charm (Su): A blackwood satyr emits an aura of incorrigible charm out
    to a radius of 30 feet. Any creature that begins its turn in this area of effect
    must succeed at a DC 19 Will save, or be affected as per the spell charm person.
    The blackwood satyr can suppress or resume this ability at will. This is a mind-affecting
    effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Pipes (Su): A blackwood satyr can focus and empower his magical abilities by playing
    haunting melodies on his panpipes. When he plays, all creatures within a 60-foot
    radius must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be affected by charm monster, deep
    slumber, reckless infatuation, or suggestion, depending on what tune the satyr
    chooses. A creature that successfully saves against any of the pipes' effects
    cannot be affected by the same set of pipes for 24 hours, but can still be affected
    by the blackwood satyr's other spell-like abilities as normal. The satyr's use
    of his pipes does not count toward his uses per day of his spelllike abilities,
    and if separated from them, he may continue to use his standard abilities. The
    pipes themselves are masterwork, and a satyr can craft a replacement with 1 week
    of labor. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: Blackwood satyrs are an especially infamous breed of fey indigenous to
  the Verduran Forest, which straddles the borders of Andoran, Taldor, and Galt. They
  are well known throughout southeastern Avistan for exuding the pleasantly sweet
  aroma of blackwood tar, from which they gain their name. Though the human population
  surrounding the Verduran Forest seldom ventures deep into the fey wood for anything
  other than logging, the blackwood satyrs seem to take perverse pleasure in waylaying
  noble lords and ladies during their passage down the heavily traveled Sellen River,
  playing songs from the river's bank to lure vessels closer and enthrall all aboard.
