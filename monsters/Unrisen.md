  Awfulness (Ex): An unrisen's form is horrifically distorted. Any creature that sees
    an unrisen within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or become nauseated
    for 1d4 rounds. Once a creature is subjected to an unrisen's awfulness aura, it
    is immune to that unrisen's awfulness aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting
    effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Essential Salts (Ex): An unrisen destroyed by fire damage, disintegration, or as
    a result of its resurrection vulnerability is reduced to a handful of metallic
    blue-green salts. Reducing an unrisen to 0 hit points while the undead is in the
    area of a consecrate or hallow effect also reduces the creature to its essential
    salts. These salts can be used as a material component for the casting of spells
    that restore life (such as raise dead, resurrection, and true resurrection), reducing
    the total cost of that spell's material components by 1,500 gp per handful of
    salts.
  Meant to Live (Su): An unrisen takes no damage from positive energy. Whenever a
    positive energy effect would otherwise deal damage to an unrisen, the unrisen
    heals half that amount of hit points instead.
  Resurrection Vulnerability (Su): A raise dead or similar spell cast on an unrisen
    destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material
    component.
  Rise Again (Su): One round after an unrisen is destroyed (unless it was reduced
    to its essential salts-see above), it returns to unlife at half its maximum hit
    points (26 hp for most unrisen), reforming in the square in which it was destroyed.
    Any creature that witnesses an unrisen rising again must succeed at a DC 16 Will
    save or be stunned for 1 round; this is a mind-affecting fear effect. An unrisen
    can rise again no more often than once per hour; if killed a second time within
    this hour it is permanently destroyed (note that this does not reduce it to its
    essential salts). The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  Even by the standards of the undead, unrisen are an affront to life. An unrisen is rarely created intentionally, as most come about when a resurrection attempt is poorly performed and results in a mishap, or through experimental alchemical processes that attempt to restore life to the dead. 

  The unrisen cling to unlife with unparalleled resilience. Their half-living organs drink in positive energy, taking a form of healing from the life-giving power. Even devastating violence cannot truly slay an unrisen, as the magic that created them reforms them over and over in a horrifying rebirth. Only the purifying touch of fire or the unrisen's dissolution to essential salts can grant these undead creatures permanent rest. 

  An unrisen is 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds

**Awfulness (Ex)** An _[[monsters/Unrisen|unrisen]]_’s form is horrifically distorted. Any creature that sees an _unrisen_ within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or become _[[conditions/Nauseated|nauseated]]_ for 1d4 rounds.

Reducing an _unrisen_ to 0 hit points while the undead is in the area of a _[[spells/Consecrate|consecrate]]_ or _[[spells/Hallow|hallow]]_ effect also reduces the creature to its essential salts. These salts can be used as a material component for the casting of spells that restore life (such as _[[spells/Raise Dead|raise dead]]_, _resurrection_, and _[[spells/True Resurrection|true resurrection]]_), reducing the total cost of that spell’s material components by 1,500 gp per handful of salts.

##### Description

Even by the standards of the undead, _unrisen_ are an affront to life. An _unrisen_ is rarely created intentionally, as most come about when a _resurrection_ attempt is poorly performed and results in a mishap, or through experimental alchemical processes that attempt to restore life to the dead.

The _unrisen_ cling to unlife with unparalleled resilience. Their half-living organs drink in positive energy, taking a form of healing from the life-giving power. Even devastating violence cannot truly slay an _unrisen_, as the magic that created them reforms them over and over in a horrifying rebirth. Only the purifying touch of fire or the _unrisen_’s _[[spells/Dissolution|dissolution]]_ to essential salts can grant these undead creatures permanent rest.

An _unrisen_ is 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds
