  Efficient Winding (Ex): A clockwork soldier can function for 2 days per Hit Die
    every time it is wound.
  Latch (Ex): Clockwork soldiers have specially designed hands that easily grasp and
    lock onto weapons and objects. A soldier can attempt to disarm or grapple as a
    standard action without provoking an attack of opportunity, and it receives a
    +2 bonus on disarm checks. In addition, it receives a +2 bonus to CMD against
    attempts to disarm it.
  Proficient (Ex): A clockwork soldier is proficient with all simple and martial weapons.
  Standby (Ex): A clockwork soldier can place itself on standby as a standard action.
    While on standby, a clockwork soldier cannot move or take any actions. It remains
    aware of its surroundings but takes a -4 penalty on Perception checks. Time spent
    on standby does not count against the soldier's wind-down duration. A clockwork
    soldier can exit standby as a swift action-if it does so to initiate combat, it
    gains a +4 racial bonus on its Initiative check.
desc_long: |-
  The clockwork soldier is a mechanical mercenary that fights to the death for its creator. With the ability to wield most weapons with full proficiency, clockwork soldiers are versatile and wholly unpredictable foes. Most are armed with magic weapons-a +1 halberd being the most common armament.

  Clockwork soldiers are among the most efficient constructs of their kind. They are ideal for sentry and guard duty. Clockwork soldiers have the same basic shape as a human. They are 6 feet tall and weigh 500 pounds.
