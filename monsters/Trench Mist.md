### Special Abilities

**Create Juju Zombie (Su)** A _[[monsters/Trench Mist|trench mist]]_ can animate

any corporeal creature that is slain while

engulfed within the mist’s form. The victim

rises as a juju zombie in 1d4 rounds, and is

under the control of the _trench mist_

that created it. A juju zombie becomes

free-willed if it is separated from

its parent _trench mist_. A trench

mist can animate and control

a number of juju zombies

whose Hit Die total does not

exceed twice the trench

mist’s own Hit Dice.

Any additional juju

zombies beyond

that become

free-willed.

**Engulfing Mists (Ex)** A _trench mist_ can _[[universal monster rules/Engulf|engulf]]_ foes. A creature engulfed

by a _trench mist_ does not gain the _[[conditions/Pinned|pinned]]_ condition and

can move normally—such a creature is not in danger of

suffocating, but as long as it begins its turn engulfed, it

takes the _trench mist_’s touch damage. A _trench mist_’s vapors

obscure sight as per the spell _[[spells/Obscuring Mist|obscuring mist]]_. The save DC to

avoid the engulfing mists is Constitution-based.

**Gaseous (Ex)** A _trench mist_ has a body composed of vapor. This

form grants it the _amorphous_ defensive ability and allows

it to pass through small holes or even mere cracks with

no reduction to its speed, but it can’t enter water or other

liquids. A _trench mist_ doesn’t have a Strength score. It can’t

manipulate or wear objects, and it is treated as a creature

three size categories smaller than its actual size (_[[classes/Medium|Medium]]_ for

most trench mists) for the purpose of how wind affects it.

**Juju Zombie Symbiosis (Su)** Because of its symbiotic

relationship with the juju zombies it creates, a _trench mist_

shares its senses with its _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Animated|animated]]_ zombies as long as they

are engulfed within its form, granting them _lifesense_ and

making them immune to the concealment the _trench mist_

imposes upon creatures within and outside of its foggy form.

##### Description

Trench mists arise from the wholesale slaughter of troops

with spells such as _[[spells/Acid Fog|acid fog]]_ and _[[spells/Cloudkill|cloudkill]]_. These magical

mists linger over the battlefield, absorbing the departing

souls and mental anguish of the slain, and developing

a supernatural, _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Malevolent|malevolent]]_ sentience. Once born, trench

mists seek only to impart misery and inf lict a choking,

scalding fate on those fortunate

enough to escape the attacks

that birthed the creature in the

first place.

As it preys upon the living, a trench

mist bleeds its _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Bitter|bitter]]_ impulses into

those it kills, adding the aff licted

to a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Growing|growing]]_ horde of shambling

servants. Victims of its acidic

mist rise as hateful zombies under

the creature’s control, and a trench

mist that gains a horde of zombies is a

dangerous foe indeed. On battlefields

where trench mists are known to

have _[[feats/Arisen|arisen]]_, wise commanders

arrange cease-fires during which

both sides abandon the site after

gaseous attacks, lest their troops

succumb to the horrifying fate

of their comrades.

A _trench mist_’s _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Billowing|billowing]]_

form extends 20 feet across,

but if bottled, weighs

less than a pound.
