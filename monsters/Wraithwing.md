  Cursed Land (Su): The area within a 3-mile radius from where a wraithwing was animated
    becomes cursed. Wraithwings can't leave this area on their own, and those that
    pass beyond its invisible borders take 1d4 points of damage for each hour they
    remain outside the cursed area.
  Hatred (Ex): A strix's natural hatred toward humans is intensified when a wraithwing
    is created. A wraithwing receives a +2 bonus on attack rolls against humanoid
    creatures of the human subtype.
  Rejuvenation (Su): The undead existence of a wraithwing is bound to a cursed area
    of land that reanimates it after its destruction. If the wraithwing is destroyed
    and its body remains within the cursed area, it reanimates the following night.
    A wraithwing can be permanently destroyed if its body is brought beyond this area
    or if its body is anointed with a vial of holy water and left in the sun for 8
    hours.
  Unholy Blast (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds, a wraithwing can beat its wings to send
    out blasts of unholy energy. Creatures in a 30-foot cone take 5d4 points of negative
    energy damage. A successful DC 15 Will save halves this damage. The save DC is
    Charisma-based.
  Wraithfire Wings (Su): A wraithwing's ghostly wings burn with a freezing green flame.
    A creature hit by one of these wings takes 1d4 points of cold damage. In addition,
    the creature is staggered for 1 round if it fails a DC 15 Fortitude save. The
    save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  Wraithwings are strix that were captured and killed by their Chelish enemies, and then rose again fueled by their lingering hatred. A terrible curse has brought them back from the dead to drive away invaders from their tribal land know as the Devil's Perch. Wraithwings roam the night, hunting down any non-strix within the cursed land, innocent and guilty alike.

  The Chelish forces that seek to occupy Devil's Perch have taken to making examples of any strix rebels they capture. After being interrogated, the captives are strung up on poles. While the strix hang there bleeding to death, their wings are broken to prevent any escape. Often, the soldiers who captured the strix warband lie in wait for anyone foolish enough to come to their rescue. This indignity kindles a burning anger within the strix that clings to their very souls. Once they have died, the bodies of the strix are dumped unceremoniously in remote locations as bait to lure strix hoping to retrieve their fallen comrades into an ambush. Dead strix tortured in this way can rise as wraithwings, but these foul creatures can be purposefully created as well.

  The mercilessly tightening grip of the Chelish Empire and the ever-rising number of dead friends and family push some strix spellcasters (typically oracles, shamans, and some witches) to turn to dark powers that whisper in the dead of night. Instead of giving a proper burial to the reclaimed bodies, the spellcaster takes them up a rugged crag and into a cavern where she prepares them for an unholy ritual. The spellcaster removes the broken wings from the bodies, and she places the bodies around a totem made of earth, wood, and bone. She then sews the wings into the totem and splashes them with blood drawn from her enemies. Upon the ritual's completion, the strix rise as wraithwings the following night. In addition to this ritual, a spellcaster of at least 11th level can create a wraithwing from the body of a dead strix using create undead.

  Wraithwings stand just over 6 feet tall, but their rotting bodies are lighter than those of living strix, weighing barely over 100 pounds.

##### Description

Wraithwings are _strix_ that were captured and killed by their Chelish enemies, and then rose again fueled by their lingering hatred. A terrible curse has brought them back from the dead to drive away invaders from their tribal land know as the Devil’s Perch. Wraithwings roam the night, hunting down any non-strix within the cursed land, innocent and guilty alike.

The Chelish forces that seek to occupy Devil’s Perch have taken to making examples of any _strix_ rebels they capture. After being interrogated, the captives are strung up on poles. While the _strix_ hang there bleeding to death, their wings are _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ to prevent any escape. Often, the soldiers who captured the _strix_ warband lie in wait for anyone foolish enough to come to their rescue. This indignity kindles a _burning_ anger within the _strix_ that clings to their very souls. Once they have died, the bodies of the _strix_ are dumped unceremoniously in remote locations as bait to lure _strix_ hoping to retrieve their _[[monsters/Fallen|fallen]]_ comrades into an ambush. Dead _strix_ tortured in this way can rise as wraithwings, but these foul creatures can be purposefully created as well.

The mercilessly tightening grip of the Chelish Empire and the ever-rising number of dead friends and family push some _strix_ spellcasters (typically oracles, shamans, and some witches) to turn to dark powers that whisper in the dead of night. Instead of giving a proper burial to the reclaimed bodies, the spellcaster takes them up a rugged crag and into a cavern where she prepares them for an _unholy_ ritual. The spellcaster removes the _broken_ wings from the bodies, and she places the bodies around a totem made of earth, wood, and bone. She then sews the wings into the totem and splashes them with blood drawn from her enemies. Upon the ritual’s completion, the _strix_ rise as wraithwings the following night. In addition to this ritual, a spellcaster of at least 11th level can create a _wraithwing_ from the body of a dead _strix_ using _[[spells/Create Undead|create undead]]_.

Wraithwings stand just over 6 feet tall, but their rotting bodies are lighter than those of living _strix_, weighing barely over 100 pounds.
