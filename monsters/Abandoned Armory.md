### Special Abilities

**Leaden Weariness (Su)** Any creature that strikes an

**Perimeter Defense (Su)** Once per minute as a standard

**Powerful Blows (Ex)** An _abandoned armory_ applies 1–1/2

its Strength modifier and threatens a critical hit on a roll of

19–20 with its slam attacks.

**Reflect Spell (Su)** Once per day as an immediate action, an

_abandoned armory_ can turn back a spell targeting it as spell

turning. An _abandoned armory_ can turn up to seven spell

levels with this ability. If an _abandoned armory_ attempts to

reflect an ineligible spell, this ability fails and is wasted.

**Tide of Metal (Su)** An _abandoned armory_ can switch

between its ebb-tide and rip-tide battle modes as a swift

action. An _abandoned armory_ begins combat in ebb-tide

##### Description

An _abandoned armory_ is an _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Animated|animated]]_ mass of weapons

and armor, both magic and mundane, as well as

spell-imbued items of offensive utility. Moving with

uncanny locomotion, these constructs scour battlefields

seeking objects of war that once held special significance

to previous owners who were slain in combat. Due to

the faint _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ imprints of the slain combatants from

which they collect these artifacts, abandoned armories

make it their mission to reunite the items with their past

owners or find new owners worthy of wielding their finds.

This process proves to be fatal, however, as the constant

_psychic_ echoes cause an _abandoned armory_ to believe

everyone is unworthy and slay them in hopes of finding

a new suitable owner for that individual’s equipment.

This behavior has led abandoned armories to become

something to be feared on the battlefield as they tear

through an area, slaying every combatant they encounter.

An _abandoned armory_ is roughly 15 feet wide, cresting

up to 20 feet tall, and weighs about 15 tons.
