special_abilities:
  Distraction (Ex): Any living creature that begins its turn with a bonestorm in its
    space must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The
    save DC is Charisma-based.
  Gather Bones (Su): By spending a full-round action in the same square as a dead
    creature, a bonestorm can shred the flesh from the corpse and absorb the bones
    into its swarm. The absorption grants the bonestorm healing (or temporary hit
    points if it is unwounded). The amount of healing depends on the size of the body
    absorbed. A Small creature grants 2 points of healing. A Medium grants 5 points,
    Large grants 10 points, and Huge grants 20 point. A bonestorm gains no benefit
    from collecting the skeletons of creatures smaller than Small or larger than Huge.
  Unholy Winds (Su): 'A bonestorm is surrounded by fierce netherwinds, the howls and
    raging essences of souls forever trapped within a whirlwind of death. As such,
    the area within 10 feet of a bonestorm is affected by winds of windstorm force
    (see page 95 of the DMG or the summary of these effects on the following page).
    Creatures that enter this area must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or be affected
    by the high winds as dictated by their size: Small or smaller creatures are blown
    away, Medium creatures are knocked down, Large creatures are checked, and larger
    creatures are unaffected. In addition, these winds are responsible for a bonestorm's
    movement and protect it from the damage and dispersal Diminutive swarms typically
    face when affected by powerful winds.'
  Wrath (Su): A bonestorm cuts apart creatures occupying the same space as it, not
    just with splintered bones and bludgeoning skulls, but with the unholy energies
    of the damned souls that make up the undead whirlwind. Thus, 3d6 points of the
    damage dealt by a bone swarm is physical, and 3d6 points are untyped damage, resulting
    directly from unholy power.
desc_long: |-
  Bonestorms are the charnel offspring of vast battlefields, the wrathful resurrections of legions of the fallen unwilling to let go of their wrath and unable to accept defeat. Amid violent currents of tormented souls, the rent corpses of the fallen rise again, formless masses of marrow and splintered bone that know only revenge.

  While bonestorms can spontaneously form-typically days or weeks after a particularly violent or meaningful battle-they have also been known to be created by malicious necromancers and arcane warlords. Brought into being to serve as lifeless engines of war or to wreak havoc upon their creators' enemies, bonestorms purposefully brought into existence have slightly more direction than their spontaneously forming counterparts. Upon completing a task, however, its not uncommon for one of these cyclones of bones to indulge its motivating rage, attacking and destroying living things far in excess of its creator's wishes.

  A bonestorm typically rises to about 10 feet tall, though it has no weight besides the hundreds of pounds of bones caught up in its macabre vortex.

##### Description

Bonestorms are the charnel offspring of vast battlefields, the wrathful resurrections of legions of the _[[monsters/Fallen|fallen]]_ unwilling to let go of their wrath and unable to accept defeat. Amid violent currents of tormented souls, the rent corpses of the _fallen_ rise again, formless masses of marrow and splintered bone that know only revenge.

While bonestorms can spontaneously form—typically days or weeks after a particularly violent or meaningful battle—they have also been known to be created by malicious necromancers and arcane warlords. Brought into being to serve as lifeless engines of war or to wreak havoc upon their creators’ enemies, bonestorms purposefully brought into existence have slightly more direction than their spontaneously forming counterparts. Upon completing a task, however, its not uncommon for one of these cyclones of bones to indulge its motivating _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_, attacking and destroying living things far in excess of its creator’s wishes.

A _bonestorm_ typically rises to about 10 feet tall, though it has no weight besides the hundreds of pounds of bones caught up in its macabre _vortex_.
