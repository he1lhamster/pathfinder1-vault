special_abilities:
  Armor of Corruption (Ex): A son of perdition is surrounded by a field of force drawn
    from its own evil essence. This grants the son of perdition a deflection bonus
    to armor class equal to its current charisma bonus.
  Conceal Alignment (Su): A son of perdition's evil aura is undetectable by any means
    unless the demon wishes to reveal it. Doing so is a free action. It requires a
    standard action for the son of perdition to conceal its alignment again.
  Natural Invisibility (Su): A son of perdition is naturally invisible but becomes
    visible when it attacks or if it chooses to reveal itself. It may resume its invisibility
    as a move action.
  Possession (Su): A son of perdition sinfully covets the physical bodies of other
    creatures. It may forcefully enter the body of any corporeal creature when the
    damage from the son of perdition's touch of the damned ability equals or exceeds
    the creature's Wisdom score, which it can sense with each successful touch of
    the damned attack. Doing so provokes an attack of opportunity from the creature
    it is trying to possess and the opponent is entitled to a Dc 21 Will save to resist
    it. If the save succeeds, the son of perdition may not make another possession
    attempt on that opponent for 24 hours. If the save fails, the son of perdition
    enters the victim's body and can control its host in the same manner as a magic
    jar spell, with an unlimited duration and no receptacle required. Each day after
    the first, the possessed creature may attempt to regain control of its body by
    making an opposed charisma check. If successful, the victim regains control for
    the next 24 hours, after which time another opposed roll is made to determine
    whether the son of perdition or the host asserts control. The possessed creature
    must repeat the opposed charisma check every 24 hours until the son of perdition
    is exorcised from him. a son of perdition can be exorcised with a successful banishment,
    dismissal, dispel evil, or holy word.
  Spawn Son of Perdition (Su): Each day a host creature is possessed by a son of perdition
    and loses the opposed roll for control of its body, the host takes 1 point of
    Wisdom drain. If the host creature's Wisdom score reaches 0, it dies and its soul
    becomes a son of perdition. The creature can only be returned to life by casting
    dispel evil on its body, followed by a true resurrection.
  Touch of the Damned (Su): A son of perdition's incorporeal body is charged with
    pure evil. When it makes a successful incorporeal touch attack on a corporeal
    non-demon, the opponent's flesh withers where touched and the son of perdition's
    unholy taint corrupts the flesh. Each successful hit deals 1d12+3 points of damage
    and provides the demon with a sense of how vulnerable its opponent is to its possession
    ability. This damage does not heal normally, and the caster of any healing spell
    must make a Dc 20 caster level check in order to heal damage from touch of the
    damned.
desc_long: |-
  The first sons of perdition came into being when a small group of angels were discovered consorting with temptresses from the Abyss, committing unspeakable carnal acts. Unrepentant of their lasciviousness and rebellious against the laws of the heavens, the angels were banished to the Abyss, their corrupted souls wrenched from their beautiful, perfect bodies. As fallen angels, the sons of perdition lost nearly all of the powers once granted in the heavens. They were embraced by the raw forces of corruption and evil in the Abyss, however, and endowed with new powers that would not only serve their covetous desire to regain physical bodies, but would promote the cause of evil and chaos as well.

  Sons of perdition are drawn to beautiful physical specimens of morality and paragons of virtue and righteousness-both qualities they once possessed but now covet and despise at the same time. Sons of perdition seek to corrupt the righteous and possess the bodies of attractive mortals, but when these qualities are lacking in their prey they make do with what they find. 

  Environment: The sons of perdition gain their power from the very essence of the Abyss, so they are often found wallowing there in their own corruption, seeking opportunities to force the misery of their damnation upon others. They are constantly on the lookout for a means of leaving the Abyss to slake their desire to possess physical bodies in the realm of mortals.

  Typical Physical Characteristics: A son of perdition looks like a sickly humanoid with pallid gray skin, the black wings of a molting raven, and empty black pits in place of eyes. Contrary to their names, numerous “daughters” of perdition exist as well. The average son of perdition stands approximately 6 feet tall.

##### Description

The first sons of perdition came into being when a small group of angels were discovered consorting with temptresses from the Abyss, committing unspeakable carnal acts. Unrepentant of their lasciviousness and rebellious against the laws of the heavens, the angels were banished to the Abyss, their corrupted souls wrenched from their beautiful, perfect bodies. As _[[monsters/Fallen|fallen]]_ angels, the sons of perdition lost nearly all of the powers once granted in the heavens. They were embraced by the raw forces of corruption and evil in the Abyss, however, and endowed with new powers that would not only serve their covetous desire to regain physical bodies, but would promote the cause of evil and chaos as well.

Sons of perdition are drawn to beautiful physical specimens of morality and paragons of _[[spells/Virtue|virtue]]_ and righteousness—both qualities they once possessed but now covet and despise at the same time. Sons of perdition seek to corrupt the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Righteous|righteous]]_ and possess the bodies of attractive mortals, but when these qualities are lacking in their prey they make do with what they find.

**Environment**: The sons of perdition gain their power from the very essence of the Abyss, so they are often found wallowing there in their own corruption, seeking opportunities to force the misery of their _[[spells/Damnation|damnation]]_ upon others. They are constantly on the _[[feats/Lookout|lookout]]_ for a means of leaving the Abyss to slake their desire to possess physical bodies in the realm of mortals.

**Typical Physical Characteristics**: A _son of perdition_ looks like a sickly humanoid with pallid _gray_ skin, the black wings of a molting raven, and empty black pits in place of eyes. Contrary to their names, numerous “daughters” of perdition exist as well. The average _son of perdition_ stands approximately 6 feet tall.
