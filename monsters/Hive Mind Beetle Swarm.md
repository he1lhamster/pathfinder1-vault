    and can only use feats that provide a static bonus.

    dodge attacks, forming holes in the swarm. It gains a +8 dodge bonus to its AC.
desc_long: |-
  Hive mind beetles have developed a peculiar method of communication. They generate arcs of electricity, the intensity and shape of which holds meaning for other beetles. Though hive mind beetles are individually only as intelligent as common insects, their capacity to process information increases dramatically when they function as a swarm. Each beetle processes and transmits basic thoughts, forming a network that mimics more complex brains. Their collective intellect makes informed decisions, evaluates risks, and even plans for the future.

  When hungry, hive mind beetle swarms don't hesitate to attack other creatures. They use their electrical control to stun and cook prey. The beetles never eat raw food, and thus are largely indifferent toward anything immune to electricity unless provoked. A creature capable of using electricity-based effects may even engage in a rudimentary conversation with a hive mind beetle swarm if it succeeds at a DC 25 Linguistics check, though most creatures don't have the same fine control the beetles possess, and their communication therefore remains broad and clumsy at best. The swarm responds by shaping itself into three-dimensional images.

  Hive mind beetle swarms' intellects focus primarily on food and weather. They can develop friendships with creatures who point them toward food sources, and may return to their new friends to inform them about approaching storms and other meteorological phenomena. Friendly swarms may even inform familiar creatures about other predators in the area, or assist in locating people or treasures (though the ravenous insects may just as readily eat the subject of their search). Hive mind beetle swarms are even capable of religious thought, considering thunderstorms to be messages from a divine being.

##### Description

Hive mind beetles have developed a peculiar method of communication. They generate arcs of electricity, the intensity and shape of which holds meaning for other beetles. Though hive mind beetles are individually only as intelligent as common insects, their capacity to process information increases dramatically when they function as a swarm. Each beetle processes and transmits basic thoughts, forming a network that mimics more complex brains. Their collective intellect makes informed decisions, evaluates risks, and even plans for the future.

When hungry, hive mind beetle swarms don’t hesitate to attack other creatures. They use their electrical control to stun and cook prey. The beetles never eat raw food, and thus are largely indifferent toward anything immune to electricity unless provoked. A creature capable of using electricity-based effects may even engage in a rudimentary conversation with a _hive mind beetle swarm_ if it succeeds at a DC 25 Linguistics check, though most creatures don’t have the same fine control the beetles possess, and their communication therefore remains broad and clumsy at best. The swarm responds by shaping itself into three-dimensional images.

Hive mind beetle swarms’ intellects focus primarily on food and weather. They can develop friendships with creatures who point them toward food sources, and may return to their new friends to inform them about approaching storms and other meteorological phenomena. Friendly swarms may even inform familiar creatures about other predators in the area, or assist in locating people or treasures (though the _[[curses/Ravenous|ravenous]]_ insects may just as readily eat the subject of their search). Hive mind beetle swarms are even capable of religious thought, considering thunderstorms to be messages from a divine being.
