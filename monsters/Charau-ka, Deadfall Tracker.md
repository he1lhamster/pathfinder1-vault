  Equally comfortable operating alone, in small teams of their kind, or leading chattering hordes of less-skilled charau-ka, deadfall trackers range across the Mwangi Expanse, tasked by Angazhani clerics or other highranking charau-ka to capture or recover slaves for Usaro's stocks. Their brutal training regimens make these ape-folk skilled in the arts of planning, patience, and silence-difficult talents for any charau-ka to master-and many become leaders among the armies of Ruthazek, the Gorilla King. Using concealment and sticking to branches high above the jungle floor, they stalk their prey and wait for targets to wander off alone or stumble into one of their traps or the wilderness' hazards, striking swiftly and mercilessly once their quarry can't fight back.

   Groups of deadfall trackers are ruthlessly efficient, staggering themselves to allow fire from multiple vantage points. They enforce a strict code of silence while marching captives back to Usaro, sometimes going so far as to sew shut the lips of slaves who won't-or can't-keep quiet. They sometimes release one or two slaves to startle unexpected travelers, using the distraction to capture a few more thralls for the Gorilla King. Slaves who show a knack for distracting prey may even become favored pets, fed well and beaten less than most. Any prisoners who flee during the trek without consent are chased down and recaptured, if the trackers feel merciful; otherwise, the fugitive becomes a welcome meal on the long, lonely trail.

   These charau-ka sometimes fall upon travelers simply to loot them, gathering supplies they need to build ingenious contraptions. Anyone who picks up the trail of a deadfall tracker is sure to come upon a devious trap before long. The secrets of trap construction and placement are kept by the elders of the tribe, who carefully detail where to place the devices in the jungle to maximize their disruptive potential.

##### Description

Equally comfortable operating alone, in small teams of their kind, or leading chattering hordes of less-skilled _charau-ka_, deadfall trackers range across the Mwangi Expanse, tasked by Angazhani clerics or other highranking _charau-ka_ to capture or recover slaves for Usaro’s stocks. Their brutal _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ regimens make these ape-folk skilled in the arts of planning, patience, and _[[spells/Silence|silence]]_—difficult talents for any _charau-ka_ to master—and many become leaders among the armies of Ruthazek, the Gorilla _[[npcs/King|King]]_. Using concealment and sticking to branches high above the jungle floor, they stalk their prey and wait for targets to wander off alone or stumble into one of their traps or the wilderness’ hazards, striking swiftly and mercilessly once their quarry can’t fight back.

Groups of deadfall trackers are ruthlessly efficient, staggering themselves to allow fire from multiple vantage points. They enforce a strict code of _silence_ while marching captives back to Usaro, sometimes going so far as to sew shut the lips of slaves who won’t—or can’t—keep quiet. They sometimes release one or two slaves to startle unexpected travelers, using the _[[universal monster rules/Distraction|distraction]]_ to capture a few more thralls for the Gorilla _King_. Slaves who show a knack for _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Distracting|distracting]]_ prey may even become favored pets, fed well and beaten less than most. Any prisoners who flee during the trek without consent are chased down and recaptured, if the trackers feel _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Merciful|merciful]]_; otherwise, the fugitive becomes a welcome meal on the long, lonely trail.

These _charau-ka_ sometimes fall upon travelers simply to loot them, gathering supplies they need to build ingenious contraptions. Anyone who picks up the trail of a deadfall tracker is sure to come upon a devious trap before long. The secrets of trap construction and placement are kept by the elders of the tribe, who carefully detail where to place the devices in the jungle to maximize their _[[feats/Disruptive|disruptive]]_ potential.
