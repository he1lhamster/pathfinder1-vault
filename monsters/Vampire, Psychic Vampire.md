  Much like their more bestial cousins, psychic vampires are undead abominations driven by a terrible hunger. However, unlike vampires and nosferatu, who feed on blood, psychic vampires hunger for the occult energy that fuels the spells of psychic spellcasters. Some scholars confuse psychic vampires with the rare vetala breed of vampires or call them “vetalaranas,” as they steal a more refined form of spiritual energy. For their part, psychic vampires consider vetalas a dying bloodline, and as their own influence increases, they strike against their corpse-possessing kin with impunity.

  A psychic vampire is usually born when a creature with psychic potential dies in a state of denial, stubbornly clinging to the material world through sheer willpower. As it dies, the creature attempts to draw on its own psychic energy and that of any living beings around it in order to cling to its mortal existence. It inevitably fails, but if its will is strong enough, it rises again. No longer able to sustain itself using its own mental energy, it hungers for the energy of others. Psychic vampires can't create spawn, and thus their numbers remain relatively small.

  A hungry psychic vampire appears in shades of gray, but when it has gorged on psychic energy, it becomes flushed with natural colors once again, and if it's careful, it might pass for a living creature. Although sunlight doesn't harm psychic vampires, they avoid it because their unnatural grayness gives away their true nature. Religious mantras and superstitious antics have no effect on psychic vampires other than to amuse them greatly, although psychic vampires who were religious in life might expect those practices to hold power over them in their undead state and react with fear until they realize the mantras can't harm them. The only thing that can give a psychic vampire pause is lack of fear in its victims.

  The home of a psychic vampire looks deceptively normal, holding fresh food and other supplies that undead creatures don't need in abundant supply. The fresh food is more than a facade, however; the psychic vampires have it fed to their captives to keep these captives fit for use as possessed bodies and reserves of psychic energy.

##### Description

Much like their more bestial cousins, _psychic_ vampires are undead abominations driven by a terrible hunger. However, unlike vampires and nosferatu, who feed on blood, _psychic_ vampires hunger for the occult energy that fuels the spells of _psychic_ spellcasters. Some scholars confuse _psychic_ vampires with the rare vetala breed of vampires or call them “vetalaranas,” as they steal a more refined form of spiritual energy. For their part, _psychic_ vampires consider vetalas a _[[conditions/Dying|dying]]_ bloodline, and as their own influence increases, they strike against their corpse-possessing kin with impunity.

A _psychic_ _vampire_ is usually born when a creature with _psychic_ potential dies in a state of denial, stubbornly clinging to the material world through sheer willpower. As it dies, the creature attempts to draw on its own _psychic_ energy and that of any living beings around it in order to cling to its mortal existence. It inevitably fails, but if its will is strong enough, it rises again. No longer able to sustain itself using its own mental energy, it hungers for the energy of others. _Psychic_ vampires can’t create spawn, and thus their numbers remain relatively small.

A hungry _psychic_ _vampire_ appears in _[[spells/Shades|shades]]_ of _[[monsters/Gray|gray]]_, but when it has gorged on _psychic_ energy, it becomes flushed with natural colors once again, and if it’s careful, it might pass for a living creature. Although sunlight doesn’t _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ _psychic_ vampires, they avoid it because their unnatural grayness gives away their true nature. Religious mantras and superstitious antics have no effect on _psychic_ vampires other than to amuse them greatly, although _psychic_ vampires who were religious in life might expect those practices to hold power over them in their undead state and react with _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ until they realize the mantras can’t _harm_ them. The only thing that can give a _psychic_ _vampire_ pause is lack of _fear_ in its victims.

The home of a _psychic_ _vampire_ looks deceptively normal, holding fresh food and other supplies that undead creatures don’t need in abundant supply. The fresh food is more than a facade, however; the _psychic_ vampires have it fed to their captives to keep these captives fit for use as possessed bodies and reserves of _psychic_ energy.
