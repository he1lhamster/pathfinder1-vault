  Deceptive (Ex): A mi-go is a master of deception. It gains a +4 racial bonus on
    Bluff and Disguise checks. Bluff and Disguise are always class skills for a mi-go.
  Evisceration (Ex): A mi-go's claws are capable of swiftly and painfully performing
    surgical operations upon helpless creatures or those it has grappled. When a mi-go
    makes a successful grapple check, in addition to any other effects caused by a
    successful grapple, it deals sneak attack damage to the victim. A creature that
    takes this damage must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of
    ability damage from the invasive surgery (the type of ability damage dealt is
    chosen by the mi-go at the time the evisceration occurs). The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  Item Creation (Ex): A mi-go possesses the ability to create strange items that blur
    the line between magic and technology, given time and resources. This ability
    allows a mi-go to ignore all of the Item Creation feat requirements and spellcasting
    requirements for creating a magic item; the resulting item is always mi-go technology.
    A mi-go can use the Heal skill to craft mi-go technology. When a mi-go uses this
    ability to craft an item, it must use a larger amount of strange ingredients and
    expendable resources-this effectively doubles the gp cost to create the item.
  Starflight (Su): A mi-go can survive in the void of outer space. It flies through
    space at incredible speeds. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a
    single solar system normally takes 3d20 months, while a trip beyond normally takes
    3d20 years (or more, at the GM's discretion)-provided the mi-go knows the way
    to its destination.
desc_long: |-
  Mi-go are both scientists and colonists-extraterrestrial travelers from deep space who view the universe as a canvas to be mastered and controlled. Their numbers on any particular planet can vary, but taken on a galactic scale, are mind-numbing in scope.

  Although a mi-go's shape might suggest it is an arthropod, the creature is in fact a highly evolved form of extraterrestrial fungus. Mi-go communicate via a combination of clicking pincers and subtle shifts in the coloration of their bulbous heads.

  A typical mi-go is roughly the size of a human, but weighs only 90 pounds.

_Mi-go_ are both scientists and colonists—extraterrestrial travelers from deep space who view the universe as a canvas to be mastered and controlled. Their numbers on any particular planet can vary, but taken on a galactic scale, are mind-numbing in scope.

Although a _mi-go_’s shape might suggest it is an arthropod, the creature is in fact a highly evolved form of extraterrestrial fungus. _Mi-go_ communicate via a combination of clicking pincers and subtle shifts in the coloration of their bulbous heads.

A typical _mi-go_ is roughly the size of a human, but weighs only 90 pounds.
