special_abilities:
  Dimension Slide (Su): A valharut can teleport up to its speed as a move action,
    provided it has line of sight to its destination. This movement does not provoke
    attacks of opportunity. A valharut can perform this ability as a full-round action
    to teleport up to double its speed and make one melee attack against a creature
    at the end of this move.
  Inviolate Aura (Su): A valharut radiates an aura of inviolate form, granting all
    allies within 60 feet a bonus to Fortitude saves to resist hostile transmutation
    effects (such as a protean's warpwave) equal to the valharut's Charisma bonus
    (+5 for the typical valharut).
  Valharut Hook (Ex): Valharuts fight with an exotic weapon that consists of two hooked
    blades projecting from opposite ends of a shaft. A valharut hook is functionally
    identical to an orc double axe, but proficiency with the orc double axe does not
    grant proficiency with a valharut hook, or vice versa.
desc_long: Valharut inevitables are champions in Axis's ongoing war with the Maelstrom
  and its protean natives. Unlike other inevitables, the valharut is not designed
  to protect or maintain a specific universal constant or planar law, but rather to
  act as a soldier against the ever-encroaching forces of chaos. As such, valharuts
  are more often seen outside of Axis, battling enemies of law under the direct orders
  of their axiomite superiors.

##### Description

Valharut inevitables are champions in Axis’s ongoing war with the Maelstrom and its protean natives. Unlike other inevitables, the valharut is not designed to protect or maintain a specific universal constant or _planar_ law, but rather to act as a soldier against the ever-encroaching forces of chaos. As such, valharuts are more often seen outside of Axis, battling enemies of law under the direct orders of their _[[monsters/Axiomite|axiomite]]_ superiors.
