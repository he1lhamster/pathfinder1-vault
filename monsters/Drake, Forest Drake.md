  Acidic Cloud (Su): A forest drake can, as a standard action, spit a ball of acid
    that bursts into a cloud on impact. This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals
    4d6 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 14 half) to all creatures within the resulting
    10-foot-radius spread. The cloud remains for 1d4 rounds once created, acting as
    a 10-foot-radius obscuring mist (it no longer causes damage), but a strong wind
    disperses it in a single round. Once a forest drake has used its acidic cloud
    breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The Reflex save is Constitution-based.
  Aquatic Adaptation (Ex): A forest drake can breathe underwater indefinitely and
    can freely use its breath weapon and other abilities while underwater. The acidic
    cloud created by that attack dissipates after 1 round if used underwater.
  Speed Surge (Ex): Three times per day as a swift action, a forest drake may draw
    on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional
    move action in that round.
desc_long: |-
  Forest drakes are the degenerate cousins of green dragons, possessed of cruel cunning but little actual wit. Like most drakes, forest drakes are bullies, prowling deep forests in search of their favorite prey-elves and fey. Forest drakes eagerly attack communities of such forest creatures unless driven off with arrows or other shows of force. 

  Like many other drake types, forest drakes organize themselves in packs called “rampages,” and keep communal lairs in secluded forest locations. Such packs are usually made up of siblings who break from the pack only during mating season. A forest drake pack has a distinct pecking order, with younger and newer members receiving the least desirable portions of pack kills and the fewest mating options. 

  Forest drakes mate once a year, but do little to raise their offspring. A female lays a clutch of four to eight eggs, but abandons her young as soon as they hatch. Forest drake hatchlings immediately band together in a pack. 

  While few survive so long, forest drakes can live up to 200 years. Forest drakes are typically about 10 feet long with equally long tails, and weigh around 1,000 pounds.

##### Description

Forest drakes are the degenerate cousins of green dragons, possessed of _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_ _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cunning|cunning]]_ but little actual wit. Like most drakes, forest drakes are bullies, prowling deep forests in search of their favorite prey—elves and fey. Forest drakes eagerly attack communities of such forest creatures unless driven off with arrows or other shows of force.

Like many other drake types, forest drakes organize themselves in packs _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ “rampages,” and keep communal lairs in secluded forest locations. Such packs are usually made up of siblings who break from the pack only during mating season. A forest drake pack has a distinct pecking order, with younger and newer members receiving the least desirable portions of pack kills and the fewest mating options.

Forest drakes mate once a year, but do little to raise their offspring. A female lays a clutch of four to eight eggs, but abandons her young as soon as they hatch. Forest drake hatchlings immediately band together in a pack.

While few survive so long, forest drakes can live up to 200 years. Forest drakes are typically about 10 feet long with equally long tails, and weigh around 1,000 pounds.
