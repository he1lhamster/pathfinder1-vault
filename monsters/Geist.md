  Spiritual Manipulation (Su): Geists have the ability to take control of haunts (Pathfinder
    RPG GameMastery Guide 242). When a geist enters a haunt's area of effect, the
    geist can immediately attempt to take over the haunt by making a Charisma check.
    If the result of the Charisma check is equal to or greater than the haunt's CR,
    the geist takes over the haunt and maintains control as long as the geist remains
    within 1 mile. If the geist's attempt to take control of a haunt fails, the geist
    must retreat from the haunt's area of effect and cannot attempt to take control
    of the haunt again for 24 hours. When a geist controls a haunt, it can activate
    or suppress the haunt's effects as a free action and the haunt automatically resets
    in half its normal time. A haunt under a geist's control can still be neutralized
    when reduced to 0 hit points, but it cannot be permanently put to rest until the
    geist that controls it is destroyed. A geist can control a number of haunts up
    to its Charisma modifier at one time (usually five).
  Terrifying Laugh (Su): Once per minute, a geist can unleash a terrifying laugh as
    a standard action. The laughter lasts until the beginning of the geist's next
    turn. All creatures within 30 feet of the geist when it begins to laugh, as well
    as all creatures that end their turn within that radius, must succeed at a DC
    21 Will save or be panicked. The save is required only once per laugh. Those who
    succeed at their saving throws need not save against the same geist's terrifying
    laughter for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: A geist is formed when an exceptionally evil humanoid is killed by a haunt
  and proves too tenacious to submit to death's call.

### Special Abilities
**Spiritual Manipulation (Su)** Geists have the ability to take control of haunts (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 242). When a _[[monsters/Geist|geist]]_ enters a haunt’s area of effect, the _geist_ can immediately attempt to take over the haunt by making a Charisma check. If the result of the Charisma check is equal to or greater than the haunt’s CR, the _geist_ takes over the haunt and maintains control as long as the _geist_ remains within 1 mile. If the _geist_’s attempt to take control of a haunt fails, the _geist_ must retreat from the haunt’s area of effect and cannot attempt to take control of the haunt again for 24 hours. When a _geist_ controls a haunt, it can activate or suppress the haunt’s effects as a free action and the haunt automatically resets in half its normal time. A haunt under a _geist_’s control can still be neutralized when reduced to 0 hit points, but it cannot be permanently put to rest until the _geist_ that controls it is destroyed. A _geist_ can control a number of haunts up to its Charisma modifier at one time (usually five).

**Terrifying Laugh (Su)** Once per minute, a _geist_ can unleash a terrifying laugh as a standard action. The laughter lasts until the beginning of the _geist_’s next turn. All creatures within 30 feet of the _geist_ when it begins to laugh, as well as all creatures that end their turn within that radius, must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or be _[[conditions/Panicked|panicked]]_. The save is required only once per laugh. Those who succeed at their saving throws need not save against the same _geist_’s terrifying laughter for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A _geist_ is formed when an exceptionally evil humanoid is killed by a haunt and proves too tenacious to submit to death’s call.
