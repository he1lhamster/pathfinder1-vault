### Special Abilities

**_Burning_ Cold (Su)** An _[[monsters/Owb|owb]]_ _[[feats/Prophet|prophet]]_ can conjure a ball of flickering flames and hurl it at an opponent as an attack action, or hurl four balls of flame as a full-attack action. These flames are ranged touch attacks with a range of 120 feet with no range increment. Each flame deals 3d6 points of cold damage. Any creature struck by the flames must succeed at a DC 24 Reflex save or become _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_ for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Curse of _Darkness_ (Su)** With a touch, an _owb_ _prophet_ can make bright light unbearable to the victim. A creature touched must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or gain the _[[universal monster rules/Light Blindness|light blindness]]_ weakness. This ability also robs the victim of its coloration, leaving the creature and its equipment washed-out _[[spells/Shades|shades]]_ of _[[monsters/Gray|gray]]_. This effect can be removed with _[[spells/Break Enchantment|break enchantment]]_ or _[[spells/Remove Curse|remove curse]]_, unless the target has the dark folk subtype, in which case the effect can be removed only by _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ or similar magic. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Deific** An _owb_ _prophet_ can grant divine spells to its worshippers. Granting spells doesn't require any specific action on the _owb_ _prophet_'s behalf. _Owb_ prophets grant access to the domains of _Darkness_, Evil, Madness, and Trickery. Their symbols and favored weapons vary based on the _owb_ _prophet_'s Forsaken patron.

**Forsaken Patron** Each _owb_ _prophet_ serves as a conduit to one of the distant, shadowy demigods known as the Forsaken. Forsaken patrons are described below, and each patron grants the _owb_ _prophet_ additional abilities. The choice of Forsaken patron cannot be changed.

##### Description

Few remember that the _Shadow_ Plane once had its own demigods, akin to the Eldest of the First World. _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|Called]]_ the Forsaken, these mysterious, evil entities had a direct hand in shaping the caligni race but then vanished for _[[monsters/Unknown|unknown]]_ reasons. Although caligni cannot call upon the Forsaken, the sinister owbs can still reach these distant demigods by performing esoteric rituals in remote temples on the _Shadow_ Plane.

An _owb_ who successfully contacts one of the Forsaken gains a fragment of the demigod’s power and forms a permanent connection to that Forsaken patron. This contact causes dramatic physical changes, often forcing the _owb_ to swell in size and sprout additional limbs, but the most significant change is that the _owb_ becomes a divine conduit. Known as _owb_ prophets, these god-touched beings grant spells to faithful worshippers on behalf of their Forsaken patrons. Unfortunately for the Forsaken, _owb_ prophets don’t pass along this divine energy gladly, always seeking a way to hoard it for themselves. The most _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cunning|cunning]]_ _owb_ prophets develop long-term plans to ascend to the _[[spells/Status|status]]_ of demigod independently and join the ranks of the Forsaken. No _owb_ _prophet_ has yet acquired sufficient spiritual energy to make this leap, but the first to succeed would be more than a peer to the distant Forsaken—it would be the only active Forsaken in the multiverse.
