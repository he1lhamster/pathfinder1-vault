### Special Abilities

**Boiling Spray (Su)** Once every 1d4 rounds as a swift action, Chavazvug can expel blasts of boiling bile, blood, and other bodily fluids from his dozens of seeping, dangling intestinal extrusions. This spray of boiling fluid strikes all creatures in a 60-foot burst centered on Chavazvug. A creature struck takes 10d10 points of fire damage and 10d10 points of acid damage from this spray of _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Toxic|toxic]]_ fluids (Reflex DC 34 half). Any creature that takes any damage at all from this boiling spray (regardless of whether it succeeded at the Reflex save) must also succeed at DC 34 Fortitude save or become _[[conditions/Nauseated|nauseated]]_ by the foul fluids for one round. This nausea effect is a poison effect. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

**Horrific Appearance (Su)** A creature that succumbs to Chavazvug’s horrific appearance feels its temperature rise swiftly, as if suddenly beset by a powerful fever. A creature that succeeds at a DC 28 Will save suffers no other effect from the qlippoth lord’s horrific appearance, but one that fails gains a fiery red or orange tinge to its flesh. An affected creature takes a permanent –4 penalty on saving throws against fire effects and gains _[[curses/Vulnerability|vulnerability]]_ to fire. All forms of fire _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ the creature benefits from function at half capacity (fire _resistance_ 30 effectively functions as fire _resistance_ 15, for example). All forms of _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to fire that the creature has or later gains are suppressed, but in this case, the creature does not take any other penalty from this horrific appearance. If a creature has the fire subtype, it loses that subtype as long as it is affected by this effect. This is a mind-affecting curse effect.

**Rejuvenation (Ex)** If Chavazvug is slain, his mind is catapulted back to one of the many boiling lakes of bile located in his Abyssal sanctum, where a new body grows around the qlippoth lord over the course of 1d10 days. During this period, Chavazvug is technically alive, but immobile and unable to take any actions other than float in the lake. If this new body is slain before the 1d10 days required to completely regrow have passed, Chavazvug is slain forever (although it should be noted that these boiling lakes of bile are rife with dangerous qlippoth and other monstrosities that are quite capable of _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Defending|defending]]_ and protecting Chavazvug’s body). This rejuvenation ability replaces the rejuvenation ability that most qlippoth lords have (see page 231); Chavazvug is easier to track down and permanently slay, but his rejuvenation ability functions anywhere in the multiverse.
**Searing Flesh (Ex)** Any creature that strikes Chavazvug with a melee weapon takes 1d6 points of fire damage from sprays of boiling matter and the mere proximity of the qlippoth lord’s superheated body. A creature that strikes Chavazvug with an unarmed strike or natural weapon takes 2d6 points of fire damage. A creature that is grappling or _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ by Chavazvug takes 4d6 points of fire damage at the start of the creature’s turn.
**Slaughter Demon (Ex)** Chavazvug gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against demons, and deals ×3 damage on a confirmed critical hit against a demon (including tieflings of demonic descent). Whenever Chavazvug slays a demon, he gains the effects of _[[spells/Death Knell|death knell]]_ for 1 hour.

**Tainted _Resurrection_ (Sp)** When Chavazvug resurrects a creature with his _resurrection_ spell-like ability, the creature restored to life becomes corrupted and its alignment shifts one step closer to chaotic evil. The creature takes a –4 penalty on saving throws against the _spell-like abilities_ and supernatural attacks of all qlippoth (this penalty is permanent, but can be removed if the creature dies and is resurrected in some way other than via Chavazvug). A creature resurrected by Chavazvug gains the possessed creature corruption template (Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures 250).

##### Description

Chavazvug appears as a towering mound of greasy, _slithering_ intestines and internal organs held aloft by five long, slender legs that taper to razor-sharp points. Twitching coils and ropes of entrails dangle below the shuddering bulk, and the entire thing steams and glows with _[[universal monster rules/Heat|heat]]_. Known as the Crawling Inferno, the very touch of this immense qlippoth lord can set flesh alight and his presence can cause living creatures normally immune to fire to _[[universal monster rules/Burn|burn]]_ alive. Chavazvug stands 50 feet high and weighs 20,000 pounds.

Unlike other qlippoth lords, Chavazvug has chosen to focus on battling demons themselves rather than the sinful souls that spawn them. This makes Chavazvug the least antagonistic of the known qlippoth lords to mortal worshipers, yet the qlippoth lord remains uncaring in the long term for the health and prosperity of “lesser beings” that worship him.

Chavazvug’s Abyssal sanctum is a vast, crater strewn wasteland in an immense underground cavern deep in the Abyss. Many of these craters are filled with bile and seepage, boiling hot lakes in which strange creatures roil and froth. New craters form constantly as portions of the ceiling miles above fall and plummet to _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Impact|impact]]_ the floor. In time, the constantly collapsing ceiling may well cause subsidence in other demonic realms far above, or even break through into the Astral Plane, at which point cultists of Chavazvug hold that their god will rise in power to become a deity.
