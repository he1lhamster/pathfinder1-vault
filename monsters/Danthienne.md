  Fool's Inspiration (Su): Once per day as a full-round action, a danthienne can designate
    a single humanoid or monstrous humanoid as her companion. An unwilling or unaware
    target can resist being made a companion by succeeding at a DC 18 Will save, but
    it is not aware that it was targeted by an effect. The danthienne is constantly
    aware of her companion's health, location, and general mood, as if she had cast
    status on the target. So long as she remains within 5 feet, the danthienne can
    also share spells with her companion, as if it were her animal companion or familiar,
    and the companion can use the danthienne's Charisma modifier instead of its own
    on Charisma checks and Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks. So long as a creature
    remains a danthienne's companion, it automatically takes 1 point of Charisma drain
    every 24 hours. A danthienne can dismiss a companion at will, and must do so if
    she wants to select a new companion. A companion who wishes to break the bond
    can attempt a DC 18 Will save once per day to do so. A break enchantment spell
    automatically severs this link. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  Rejected from the courts of the fey realms, danthiennes- sometimes called gossip pixies-nevertheless delight in courtly intrigue. They adore the trappings of wealth and class, but lack a deeper understanding of politics, and focus most of their energy on personal entertainment and accumulating wardrobes of rich fabrics and random jewelry. These tiny fey spend their time skulking around academies, guilds, and noble courts, stealing valuables and influencing mortal minds to create drama. When they do reveal their presence, danthiennes portray themselves as wish granters, offering to make a person's dreams come true in exchange for services and treasures. In reality, they have no special gift to grant wishes and rely on their magic, bluffs, and mundane theft to uphold their end of any bargain. Danthiennes rarely operate alone, usually enticing a desperate courtier into serving them in exchange for popularity. More rarely, they assemble lesser fey into mock courts, drafting unsuspecting mortals into their sometimes-deadly intrigues. As degenerate, urban cousins of nymphs, they have the ability to bond with mortal creatures and invest them with passion and confidence-but the bond is a deadly one, slowly draining the life force from their temporary partners and ultimately leaving them catatonic. 

  Danthiennes stand just 10 inches tall and weigh only a few pounds, despite their plump forms.

##### Description

Rejected from the courts of the fey realms, danthiennes— sometimes _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ gossip pixies—nevertheless delight in courtly intrigue. They adore the trappings of wealth and class, but lack a deeper understanding of politics, and focus most of their energy on personal entertainment and accumulating wardrobes of rich fabrics and random _jewelry_. These tiny fey spend their time skulking around academies, guilds, and noble courts, stealing valuables and influencing mortal minds to create drama. When they do reveal their presence, danthiennes portray themselves as _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ granters, offering to make a person’s dreams come true in exchange for services and treasures. In reality, they have no special gift to grant wishes and rely on their magic, bluffs, and mundane theft to uphold their end of any bargain. Danthiennes rarely operate alone, usually enticing a desperate courtier into serving them in exchange for popularity. More rarely, they assemble lesser fey into mock courts, drafting unsuspecting mortals into their sometimes-deadly intrigues. As degenerate, urban cousins of nymphs, they have the ability to bond with mortal creatures and invest them with passion and confidence—but the bond is a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ one, slowly draining the life force from their temporary partners and ultimately leaving them catatonic.

Danthiennes stand just 10 inches tall and weigh only a few pounds, despite their plump forms.
