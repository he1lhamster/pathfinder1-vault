  Deskari's influence upon the Worldwound's verminous life cannot be ignored for long by visitors to this tainted land. While some giant vermin have resisted Deskari's influence, most have succumbed to it. Such creatures are almost always encountered along the Worldwound's periphery. As one travels deeper into the blighted land, the immense insects, spiders, and other vermin encountered in the canyons and rivers take on an increasingly unsettling intelligence and demonic features. In many ways, these demonic vermin are no longer true denizens of the Material Plane-they are, after a fact, what happens when the chaos and evil of the Abyss infuse a mindless creature. They are the unholy spawn of vermin-and mortal sins. 

  Countless variations of demonic vermin exist in the forbidding wasteland that is the Worldwound. When a nest of similar monsters is encountered, they all typically share the same demonic powers and traits, but another nest of the same species could exhibit entirely different abilities, depending on the nature of the Abyssal energies that have corrupted and transformed them. Uncorrupted giant vermin that wander into or are otherwise brought into the Worldwound do not immediately fall victim to this vile transformation, but several months of exposure can, at the GM's whim, cause such creatures to spontaneously transform into one of these hideous monstrosities.

##### Description

Deskari’s influence upon the Worldwound’s verminous
life cannot be ignored for long by visitors to this
tainted land. While some _[[spells/Giant Vermin|giant vermin]]_ have resisted
Deskari’s influence, most have succumbed to it. Such
creatures are almost always encountered along the
Worldwound’s periphery. As one travels deeper into the
blighted land, the immense insects, spiders, and other
vermin encountered in the canyons and rivers take on
an increasingly unsettling intelligence and demonic
features. In many ways, these demonic vermin are no
longer true denizens of the Material Plane—they are,
after a fact, what happens when the chaos and evil of the
Abyss infuse a mindless creature. They are the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Unholy|unholy]]_
spawn of vermin—and mortal sins.

Countless variations of demonic vermin exist in the
forbidding wasteland that is the Worldwound. When
a nest of similar monsters is encountered, they all
typically share the same demonic powers and traits, but
another nest of the same species could exhibit entirely
different abilities, depending on the nature of the
Abyssal energies that have corrupted and transformed
them. Uncorrupted _giant vermin_ that wander into or
are otherwise brought into the Worldwound do not
immediately fall victim to this vile _[[spells/Transformation|transformation]]_,
but several months of exposure can, at the GM’s whim,
cause such creatures to spontaneously transform into
one of these hideous monstrosities.
