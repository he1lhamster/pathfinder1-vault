  Create Trap (Su): Once per week, a gearghost can create a trap of CR 4 or lower
    regardless of cost, materials, or skill checks. Two or more gearghosts working
    together on a trap can increase the maximum CR by 2 for each additional gearghost
    working in concert. For example, three gearghosts working together can create
    any CR 8 or lower trap in a week. Example traps can be found on page 420 of Pathfinder
    RPG Core Rulebook.
  Rejuvenation (Su): A destroyed gearghost reforms in 2d6 days. To permanently destroy
    a gearghost, holy water must be poured over its remains within the area of a hallow
    spell. To complete the destruction, every trap within 100 feet of the remains
    must be successfully disabled or destroyed before the gearghost is completely
    destroyed.
  Resetter (Ex): A gearghost can reset traps and keep them repaired with supernatural
    efficiency. A gearghost can reset a trap with a repair or manual reset as a move
    action. If a trap has an automatic reset that is longer than immediate, a gear
    ghost can reset that trap as a free action.
desc_long: Formed from the unquiet soul of a thief wrenched from life by a wicked
  trap, a gearghost delights in rigging up the same threats and tortures to which
  it succumbed. Eager to witness the deaths of others, the gearghost prowls the place
  of its death, constantly maintaining and resetting any traps in that area as it
  waits for victims to fall into its clutches. A gearghost also has the ability to
  create and set new traps, and as such its lair is usually choked with perilous new
  snares, spikes, and pits. A gearghost only keeps treasure as a lure for hapless
  adventurers, often using such treasure as the trigger for one of its devious creations.
