  Challenge (Su): Two times per day as a swift action, a heikegani can challenge a
    foe to combat. Until either that foe is rendered unconscious, or the combat ends,
    the heikegani gains a +4 bonus on damage rolls against that enemy, and takes a
    -2 penalty to AC except against attacks made by the challenged foe. The heikegani
    gains DR 2/- against attacks made by the target of its challenge.
  Intimidating Glare (Ex): As a full-round action, a heikegani can stand on its rear
    legs and display its facelike carapace, snapping its pincers in a threatening
    display. The heikegani can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all foes
    within 30 feet that can see its display, as if it had used the Dazzling Display
    feat. It doesn't take penalties on this check for being smaller than its targets.
  Memory of Honor (Su): Once per day when the heikegani is about to attempt a saving
    throw or skill check, it can call upon the resolve it held to in its prior life,
    gaining a +4 bonus on the roll. The heikegani must decide to use this ability
    before the roll is made.
desc_long: |-
  Samurai are renowned for their resolve, but sometimes a samurai becomes so obsessed with her purpose that her soul can't depart from the Material Plane upon her death. Unable to seek eternal rest, and unwilling to become undead in the pursuit of vengeance, the samurai's soul instead finds a suitable host in which to continue its existence. A heikegani is the effect of such a joining: a tragic, furious symbiosis of the soul of a dead samurai and the body of a crustacean. This usually occurs when the samurai dies near a crab habitat and her soul imprints upon a newly hatched crab zoea. Magic is always involved, either because the death happened in a high-magic environment or because the samurai was dealt a magical deathblow. A heikegani is especially vicious when young, and kills other crabs and marine creatures it encounters until it develops the ability to travel onto land. Each time the heikegani molts, its new shell comes to more closely resemble an angry demonic face.
   The soul of a heikegani has very few of its memories from life, but retains its single-minded sense of purpose and honor, and is quick to challenge those it meets to mortal combat. A heikegani believes it has been reincarnated, but in reality it never passed on to be judged. The unnatural genesis of a heikegani causes it great agony, and the dangerous crustacean scuttles along the shores, seeking foes that it can defeat in honorable combat so its soul can finally be put to rest.

##### Description

_[[classes/Samurai|Samurai]]_ are renowned for their resolve, but sometimes a _samurai_ becomes so obsessed with her purpose that her soul can’t depart from the Material Plane upon her death. Unable to seek eternal rest, and unwilling to become undead in the pursuit of _[[feats/Vengeance|vengeance]]_, the _samurai_’s soul instead finds a suitable host in which to continue its existence. A _heikegani_ is the effect of such a joining: a tragic, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Furious|furious]]_ symbiosis of the soul of a dead _samurai_ and the body of a crustacean. This usually occurs when the _samurai_ dies near a crab habitat and her soul imprints upon a newly hatched crab zoea. Magic is always involved, either because the death happened in a high-magic environment or because the _samurai_ was dealt a magical deathblow. A _heikegani_ is especially _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_ when young, and kills other crabs and marine creatures it encounters until it develops the ability to travel onto land. Each time the _heikegani_ molts, its new shell comes to more closely resemble an angry demonic face.
 The soul of a _heikegani_ has very few of its memories from life, but retains its single-minded sense of purpose and honor, and is quick to challenge those it meets to mortal combat. A _heikegani_ believes it has been reincarnated, but in reality it never passed on to be judged. The unnatural genesis of a _heikegani_ causes it great agony, and the dangerous crustacean scuttles along the shores, seeking foes that it can defeat in honorable combat so its soul can finally be put to rest.
