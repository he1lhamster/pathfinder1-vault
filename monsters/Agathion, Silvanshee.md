  Cat's Luck (Su): A silvanshee adds its Charisma modifier as a luck bonus on all
    its saving throws. Once per day as a standard action, it can also grant this bonus
    to one ally within 30 feet for 10 minutes.
  Heroic Strength (Su): Once per day, a silvanshee can grant itself a +8 enhancement
    bonus to Strength for 1 minute.
  Spectral Mist (Su): A silvanshee can assume an eerie, mist-like form roughly the
    size and shape of a cat. This ability has the same effect as a gaseous form spell,
    except the silvanshee retains its own DR and supernatural abilities and can move
    at its normal speed. It can remain in mist form up to 5 minutes per day. This
    duration does not have to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.
desc_long: |-
  Silvanshees are curious but reclusive cat agathions. Unobtrusive and able to blend in among normal animals (unlike the more anthropomorphic agathions), they are the eyes and ears of the good planes in the mortal world. Most roam hills, forests, and plains, keeping an eye out for evil influences. They can be taken as familiars by 7th-level good spellcasters who utilize the Improved Familiar feat and meet the proper prerequisites. As familiars, silvanshees act as moral guides and steer their mortal allies toward corruptive forces that must be eliminated. In some mortal lands, they are called cat sìth or cath sidhe, and are believed to be disguised witches or fairies-and not necessarily benign creatures, which only encourages silvanshees to avoid strangers. 

  Silvanshees are not fond of open combat, even against demons, devils, or other fiendish threats, and they're likely to run away if confronted. When they must fight, they prefer greater numbers and the element of surprise, using their magic to temporarily overcome their physical weaknesses, and melting away into mist if the battle turns against them. 

  A silvanshee is the size of a large domestic cat, though almost always sleek rather than fat, and weighs 20 pounds on average.

##### Description

Silvanshees are curious but reclusive cat agathions. Unobtrusive and able to _[[spells/Blend|blend]]_ in among normal animals (unlike the more anthropomorphic agathions), they are the eyes and ears of the good planes in the mortal world. Most roam hills, forests, and plains, keeping an eye out for evil influences. They can be taken as familiars by 7th-level good spellcasters who utilize the _[[feats/Improved Familiar|Improved Familiar]]_ feat and meet the proper prerequisites. As familiars, silvanshees act as moral guides and steer their mortal allies toward corruptive forces that must be eliminated. In some mortal lands, they are _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ cat sìth or cath sidhe, and are believed to be disguised witches or fairies—and not necessarily benign creatures, which only encourages silvanshees to avoid strangers.

Silvanshees are not fond of open combat, even against demons, devils, or other fiendish threats, and they’re likely to run away if confronted. When they must fight, they prefer greater numbers and the element of surprise, using their magic to temporarily overcome their physical weaknesses, and melting away into mist if the battle turns against them.
