### Special Abilities

**Hide in Plain Sight (Su)** A _[[monsters/Bloody Bones|bloody bones]]_ can use Stealth even while being observed; as long as it is within 10 feet of a reflective surface like a _mirror_ or calm body of water, a _bloody bones_ can hide itself from view in the open without having anything to hide behind.

**_Mirror_ _Jump_ (Su)** A _bloody bones_ can use its _dimension door_ spell-like ability to leap between reflective surfaces within range of each other (such as mirrors, darkened windows, or calm water), but can also opt to remain in hiding within such a reflection. The reflective surface must be large enough for the _bloody bones_ to pass through with ease (at least 2 feet wide and 2 feet tall). While hidden this way, the _bloody bones_ can use its _lifesense_ to detect prey near the reflective surface. When an adjacent victim looks into the surface, the _bloody bones_ can leap out as a swift action (often appearing as though the target’s own skeleton were ripping free to attack) and manifest in any square adjacent to the viewer. When a _bloody bones_ uses this action, all creatures within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1d4 rounds, and the triggering viewer takes a –4 penalty on this saving throw. The staggering effect is a mind-affecting _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**_Unholy_ _Grace_ (Ex)** A _bloody bones_ applies its Charisma modifier to its AC and on Reflex saves as a profane bonus.

##### Description

In many lands, parents have used tales of _bloody bones_ to frighten children away from dangerous ponds or to keep them from misbehaving, especially at night. At first sight, these monsters are easy to confuse for particularly gruesome skeletons. _Bloody bones_, however, have an evil intelligence. They revel in creating _fear_ in their victims, using their natural stealth to haunt and frighten a creature for hours or even days before revealing themselves.

_Bloody bones_ are the creations of horrific creatures known as rawheads (see page 242), which have the ability to _[[spells/Command|command]]_ these _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Gory|gory]]_ undead to do their whims. Even when not directed by the malevolence of a _[[monsters/Rawhead|rawhead]]_, though, a _bloody bones_ is adept at wreaking havoc on local settlements. The inhabitants of a region plagued by a _bloody bones_ often have no idea of the true nature of the creature that menaces them, which only furthers the urban legends and frightening stories that rise in the wake of these violent, undead monstrosities.

A typical _bloody bones_ is approximately 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 60 pounds.
