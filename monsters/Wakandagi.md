### Special Abilities

**Water Bomb (Su)** As a standard action, a

_[[monsters/Wakandagi|wakandagi]]_ can spit a ball of water at a target

within 60 feet as a ranged touch attack. If

successful, the attack is resolved as a bull rush

using the _wakandagi_’s CMB. This bull rush doesn’t

provoke an attack of opportunity. If the ball of water

successfully hits, it remains in the square of the target struck.

If the ball of water misses, it continues in a straight line and

lands at the extent of its range. This ball is 2 feet across and

weighs 50 pounds. One round after the _wakandagi_ spits the

ball of water, it explodes, dealing 10d6 points of nonlethal

damage to all creatures within a 20-foot radius (Reflex DC 25

half). The save DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

Ardent defenders of large f lowing rivers and the

branching tributaries that accompany them, wakandagis

swim through wild, untouched lands, valiantly working

to _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_ them from those who would over-settle their

banks, spoil their purity, and take from their bounty

without consideration for the needs of the river or

the other creatures that inhabit it. When destructive

creatures poison the rivers or humanoids draw too many

fish from their waters, wakandagis are roused to confront

the despoilers, either to force them to f lee or to end their

_[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ by any means necessary.

While a _wakandagi_’s anger is fierce, it is not easily roused.

Simple fishing expeditions and the occasional traveler are left

in peace; only those doing extreme and malicious damage to

the rivers in a _wakandagi_’s territory provoke it, and the creature

attacks only after great

deliberation. While these

majestic beasts are rarely

encountered by humans,

tales around the fires of

fish camps and within

the relative safety

of riverside taverns

claim that, when

riled, a _wakandagi_

will come screaming

out from within

a _[[spells/Veil|veil]]_ of clinging

mist, scattering foes,

capsizing boats, and

spitting its water

bombs, which

can render a foe _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_. Any

creature straying too close to the beast

falls victim to its branching antlers.

The other, less destructive tales

involving wakandagis portray them as

considerate and kind-hearted beasts, sometimes

f looding a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Burning|burning]]_ field to save a crop of corn,

pushing a sinking boat to shore to save the crew,

or even saving a child bitten by a viper while

playing in the river.

A _wakandagi_ stands 9 feet at the shoulder,

stretches 18 feet from nose to tail, and

weighs 2,200 pounds.
