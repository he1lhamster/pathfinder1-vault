special_abilities:
  Absorb Magic (Ex): When a spell or spell-like ability fails to overcome Vorgozen's
    spell resistance, it is wholly or partially absorbed by the kaiju. If the spell
    was an area-effect spell or targeted more than just Vorgozen, it functions normally
    against other targets and Vorgozen regains a number of hit points equal to double
    the spell's level. If the spell targeted only Vorgozen, she absorbs the entire
    spell and regains a number of hit points equal to 10 × the spell's level. Whenever
    Vorgozen absorbs magic in this way, her polluted magic aura grows more powerful
    (whether or not the absorbed magic healed her of damage); all rolls to determine
    the effect of polluted magic are modified by +20 for the remainder of the round.
  Acid Beam (Su): Once every 4 rounds, Vorgozen can unleash a beam of foul acid. This
    creates a 1,200-foot line of high pressure caustic fluid. All creatures caught
    in the area of effect take 20d6 points of acid damage and 20d6 points of bludgeoning
    damage, and are knocked prone. A creature that succeeds at a DC 43 Reflex save
    takes half damage and avoids being knocked prone. A Huge or smaller creature that
    is knocked prone is also pushed away from Vorgozen. A Huge creature is pushed
    back 10 feet, a Large creature 20 feet, a Medium creature 40 feet, and Small or
    smaller creatures 80 feet. Creatures that are pushed take 1d6 additional points
    of bludgeoning damage per 10 feet they are pushed, but can attempt a DC 43 Reflex
    save to halve this additional damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Infuse Terrain (Su): Once per day as a standard action, Vorgozen can dematerialize
    and seep into the terrain, infusing it with her polluted nature. The kaiju appears
    to simply melt into the surrounding terrain when she uses this ability, vanishing
    from view. The terrain in a 1-mile radius becomes infused with the kaiju's essence-if
    the terrain is swamp or other wetland, the radius increases to 10 miles. While
    infusing terrain, Vorgozen cannot be harmed, and all magical effects generated
    in the region can trigger polluted effects (see Polluted Magic below). Vorgozen
    remains aware of what takes place in the region of infused terrain, and she can
    remain infused in the terrain indefinitely, during which time she does not need
    to breathe, eat, or sleep. She can emerge from the terrain at any point within
    the infused region as a swift action, gaining the benefit of a heal spell (CL
    20th) when she does so. Alternatively, she can suppress all effects of her presence
    on the terrain for up to 24 hours to move at a speed of 50 miles per hour, as
    per shadow walk. When she ceases moving (typically upon arriving at a region with
    powerful magic that has drawn her attention), her presence remains suppressed
    and she cannot move for the remainder of the 24 hours, at which point the suppression
    ends and her presence again infuses the surrounding terrain.
  Polluted Magic (Su): Vorgozen's presence pollutes magic, causing magical abilities
    to become unreliable when used within 300 feet of the kaiju. When a creature within
    this area generates a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural effect, roll
    on the table below to see how Vorgozen's polluting presence hampers or transforms
    the effect. Effects created by creatures outside of this 300-foot aura are unaffected
    by Vorgozen's polluted magic, even if the effect of the spell or supernatural
    ability enters the area of polluted magic or targets Vorgozen. Likewise, ongoing
    spell effects or supernatural effects are not polluted when Vorgozen's aura envelops
    them. Vorgozen's own supernatural abilities never trigger polluted magic effects.
    d% Result 1-30 The spell or supernatural effect functions normally. 31-50 The
    spell or supernatural effect is diluted, functioning at half capacity (caster
    level, all damage and other randomly determined elements, and durations and areas
    of effect not determined by caster level are halved); the DCs of saving throws
    to resist the effect are decreased by 10. 51-70 The spell or supernatural effect
    is cancelled and its use for that activation is wasted. 71-90 The spell or supernatural
    effect is canceled and its use for that activation is wasted. The creator of the
    spell or supernatural effect must succeed at a DC 35 Fortitude save or be nauseated
    for 1d4 rounds. The nausea is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
    91 or higher The spell or supernatural effect is canceled and its use for that
    activation is wasted. The creator of the spell or supernatural effect must succeed
    at a DC 35 Will save or suffer the effects of feeblemind (CL 20th). The feeblemind
    effect is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Swallow Whole (Ex): If a creature that is swallowed whole by Vorgozen manages to
    escape by cutting itself free, Vorgozen's gelatinous body simply seals over the
    hole created so that other swallowed creatures must cut their own way out.
desc_long: |-
  Most kaiju are ancient creatures that have dwelled in hidden lairs since the dawn of civilization, prehistoric monsters woken from eons-long slumbers, or alien entities who visit the world only rarely. But Vorgozen (referred to as the Shapeless Feeder by some, and as Queen Vorgozen by those who wish to see all magic abolished from the world) is a relatively recent addition to the world's kaiju. This accidental but overwhelmingly powerful creation was forged from the unfortunate combination of hubris and arrogance. The absolute destruction of the remote academy in an immense fen that gave rise to the Shapeless Feeder left few clues as to the nature of the potent magic the wizards there were toying with. What hints remain suggest it involved reverse-engineering an artifact in an attempt to distill the potent powers held within the core of a once flying city. 

  Born as she was out of the abuse of magical power, Vorgozen is very much a personification of the arrogant wizard who values the study and mastery of magic and the pursuit of arcane power over all else. The Shapeless Feeder was not content to remain at the epicenter of her accidental creation, and has instead seeped through the world, drawn by powerful magical auras or supernatural foci. Fortunately for civilization, after emerging to destroy, the Shapeless Feeder invariably retreats to vast swamplands such as the site of her genesis to hibernate for decades before rousing once again from her slumber. 

  The powerful magic of other kaiju's supernatural abilities is particularly coveted by Vorgozen, and she enjoys polluting these effects more than any other. She is often drawn to places where other kaiju rampage as a result. 

  Queen Vorgozen is an immense mound of protoplasm nearly 80 feet in diameter. She weighs 24,000 tons.

### Special Abilities

**Absorb Magic (Ex)** When a spell or spell-like ability fails to overcome Vorgozen’s _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_, it is wholly or partially absorbed by the kaiju. If the spell was an area-effect spell or targeted more than just Vorgozen, it functions normally against other targets and Vorgozen regains a number of hit points equal to double the spell’s level. If the spell targeted only Vorgozen, she absorbs the entire spell and regains a number of hit points equal to 10 × the spell’s level. Whenever Vorgozen absorbs magic in this way, her polluted _[[spells/Magic Aura|magic aura]]_ grows more powerful (whether or not the absorbed magic healed her of damage); all rolls to determine the effect of polluted magic are modified by +20 for the remainder of the round.

**Acid Beam (Su)** Once every 4 rounds, Vorgozen can unleash a beam of foul acid. This creates a 1,200-foot line of high pressure caustic fluid. All creatures caught in the area of effect take 20d6 points of acid damage and 20d6 points of bludgeoning damage, and are knocked _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_. A creature that succeeds at a DC 43 Reflex save takes half damage and avoids being knocked _prone_. A Huge or smaller creature that is knocked _prone_ is also pushed away from Vorgozen. A Huge creature is pushed back 10 feet, a Large creature 20 feet, a _[[classes/Medium|Medium]]_ creature 40 feet, and Small or smaller creatures 80 feet. Creatures that are pushed take 1d6 additional points of bludgeoning damage per 10 feet they are pushed, but can attempt a DC 43 Reflex save to halve this additional damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Infuse Terrain (Su)** Once per day as a standard action, Vorgozen can dematerialize and seep into the terrain, infusing it with her polluted nature.

##### Description

Most kaiju are ancient creatures that have dwelled in hidden lairs since the dawn of civilization, prehistoric monsters woken from eons-long slumbers, or alien entities who visit the world only rarely. But Vorgozen (referred to as the Shapeless Feeder by some, and as Queen Vorgozen by those who _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ to see all magic abolished from the world) is a relatively recent addition to the world’s kaiju. This accidental but overwhelmingly powerful creation was forged from the unfortunate combination of hubris and arrogance. The absolute _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ of the remote academy in an immense fen that gave rise to the Shapeless Feeder left few clues as to the nature of the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ magic the wizards there were toying with. What hints remain suggest it involved reverse-engineering an artifact in an attempt to distill the _potent_ powers held within the core of a once flying city.

Born as she was out of the abuse of magical power, Vorgozen is very much a personification of the arrogant _[[classes/Wizard|wizard]]_ who values the study and mastery of magic and the pursuit of arcane power over all else. The Shapeless Feeder was not content to remain at the epicenter of her accidental creation, and has instead seeped through the world, drawn by powerful magical auras or supernatural foci. Fortunately for civilization, after emerging to destroy, the Shapeless Feeder invariably retreats to vast swamplands such as the site of her genesis to _[[spells/Hibernate|hibernate]]_ for decades before rousing once again from her slumber.

The powerful magic of other kaiju’s supernatural abilities is particularly coveted by Vorgozen, and she enjoys polluting these effects more than any other. She is often drawn to places where other kaiju rampage as a result.

Queen Vorgozen is an immense mound of protoplasm nearly 80 feet in diameter. She weighs 24,000 tons.
