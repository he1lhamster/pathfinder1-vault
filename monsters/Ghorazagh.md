  Bloodsense (Su): A ghorazagh notices living creatures within 60 feet just as if
    it possessed the blindsight ability.
  Bloodspray (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds, a ghorazagh can unleash a 20-foot cone of
    blood and eldritch enzymes. Any living creature struck by a ghorazagh's bloodspray
    must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or be affected as by the spell slow. A slowed
    creature struck by a ghorazagh's bloodspray a second time must make an additional
    save or be paralyzed. These effects last for 2d6 rounds. A ghorazagh can also
    consciously alter its enzymes, producing a spray that removes all effects of this
    ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Chemical Communication (Ex): Ghorazaghs can communicate with other ghorazaghs within
    60 feet via pheromone transmission. In a ghorazagh hive, this range extends to
    cover the entire hive. This is a silent and instantaneous mode of communication
    that only ghorazaghs can understand.
desc_long: |-
  Ghorazaghs-or gore weavers-float like tumorous specters through the deepest, most alien cavities of the lightless underground, preying upon the wretched vermin of those horrid places. Cunning, with minds and drives unknowable and obscene to those of lands above, the gore weavers only recently became aware of the fertility and bounty of the surface world and are now slowly turning their ebon eyes upward.

  While ghorazaghs can digest nearly anything, they are incapable of digesting blood. Their digestive systems process flesh, bone, and all other organic material, filtering out blood and storing it in large reservoirs within their bodies, whereupon the blood is mixed internally with mucus and other strange fluids to form a thick, gluelike substance. While a ghorazagh can spray this fluid as an attack to impede prey, the primary use of the foul substance is as a building material. Ghorazagh hives are constructed entirely of this material, which when it dries has the strength of metal while retaining a dark red resinlike appearance. A ghorazagh hive is a nightmare place as a result-twisting tunnels with an eerily organic appearance that can wind for miles on end.

##### Description

Ghorazaghs—or gore weavers—float like tumorous specters through the deepest, most alien cavities of the lightless underground, preying upon the wretched vermin of those horrid places. _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cunning|Cunning]]_, with minds and drives unknowable and obscene to those of lands above, the gore weavers only recently became aware of the fertility and bounty of the surface world and are now slowly turning their ebon eyes upward.

While ghorazaghs can digest nearly anything, they are incapable of digesting blood. Their digestive systems process flesh, bone, and all other organic material, filtering out blood and storing it in large reservoirs within their bodies, whereupon the blood is mixed internally with mucus and other strange fluids to form a thick, gluelike substance. While a _ghorazagh_ can spray this fluid as an attack to impede prey, the primary use of the foul substance is as a building material. _Ghorazagh_ hives are constructed entirely of this material, which when it dries has the strength of metal while retaining a dark red resinlike appearance. A _ghorazagh_ hive is a _[[spells/Nightmare|nightmare]]_ place as a result—twisting tunnels with an eerily organic appearance that can wind for miles on end.
