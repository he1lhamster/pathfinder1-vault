special_abilities:
  Disperse the Rabble (Su): As a standard action, a hykariut can attempt a single
    melee attack with its warhammer against one creature within its reach. If it hits,
    it deals damage as normal and releases a suppressing shockwave centered on the
    target. This shockwave functions as order's wrath (CL 20th, Will DC 22) unless
    the attack roll is a critical hit, in which case the hykariut can instead have
    the shockwave function as dictum (CL 20th, Will DC 25).
  Drastic Measures (Su): Once per day as a swift action, a hykariut can condemn one
    creature it can see. The condemned creature's alignment is treated as chaotic
    for the purpose of resolving the hykariut's abilities and spell-like abilities
    for 24 hours. If the creature is already chaotic, it instead takes a -2 penalty
    on its saving throws against the hykariut's abilities and spell-like abilities
    and it is treated as though it has an overwhelming chaotic aura for the purpose
    of the inevitable's smite chaos ability.
  Judicious (Su): A hykariut can show considerable restraint when suppressing riots.
    The hykariut can deal nonlethal damage with its weapons without taking a -4 penalty
    on attack rolls. When using dictum, a hykariut can choose for the spell to treat
    each affected creature as though its Hit Dice were no more than 9 below the inevitable's
    caster level. When using order's wrath, a hykariut can choose for the spell to
    deal nonlethal damage to affected creatures.
  Smite Chaos (Su): Three times per day as a swift action, a hykariut can choose a
    creature it can see to smite. If the target is chaotic, the hykariut adds its
    Charisma bonus as a bonus on weapon damage rolls against that creature, and its
    attacks automatically bypass any damage reduction the creature might have. If
    the target has a strong or overwhelming chaotic aura, the bonus damage increases
    to twice the hykariut's Charisma modifier on its first successful attack against
    that creature. The smite chaos effect remains until the target of the smite is
    dead or until 24 hours have passed.
  Unimpeachable (Ex): Any weapon a hykariut wields cannot be disarmed or sundered
    by chaotic creatures.
desc_long: |-
  Whereas most inevitables punish individual crimes such as oath breaking and murder, the mighty hykariuts quash rebellions and extinguish revolutions. These inevitables care little for petty uprisings, instead focusing on those upheavals that are at risk of spreading catastrophically, setting off a chain reaction of chaotic destabilizations. When such a riot reaches its critical mass, a hykariut stoically marches into its epicenter to scatter the rebellious citizens and crush the ideological leaders.

   A hykariut is 14 feet tall and weighs 5,000 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**Disperse the Rabble (Su)** As a standard action, a hykariut can attempt a single melee attack with its _warhammer_ against one creature within its reach. If it hits, it deals damage as normal and releases a suppressing shockwave centered on the target. This shockwave functions as order’s wrath (CL 20th, Will DC 22) unless the attack roll is a critical hit, in which case the hykariut can instead have the shockwave function as _dictum_ (CL 20th, Will DC 25).

**Drastic Measures (Su)** Once per day as a swift action, a hykariut can condemn one creature it can see. The condemned creature’s alignment is treated as chaotic for the purpose of resolving the hykariut’s abilities and _spell-like abilities_ for 24 hours. If the creature is already chaotic, it instead takes a –2 penalty on its saving throws against the hykariut’s abilities and _spell-like abilities_ and it is treated as though it has an overwhelming chaotic aura for the purpose of the inevitable’s smite chaos ability.

**Judicious (Su)** A hykariut can show considerable restraint when suppressing riots. The hykariut can deal nonlethal damage with its weapons without taking a –4 penalty on attack rolls.

The smite chaos effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or until 24 hours have passed.

##### Description

Whereas most inevitables punish individual crimes such as oath _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Breaking|breaking]]_ and murder, the mighty hykariuts quash rebellions and extinguish revolutions. These inevitables care little for petty uprisings, instead focusing on those upheavals that are at risk of spreading catastrophically, setting off a chain reaction of chaotic destabilizations. When such a riot reaches its critical mass, a hykariut stoically marches into its epicenter to scatter the rebellious citizens and crush the ideological leaders.

A hykariut is 14 feet tall and weighs 5,000 pounds.
