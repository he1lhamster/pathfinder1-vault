special_abilities:
  Aura of Fate (Su): A creature that ends its turn within an irii's 30-foot-radius
    aura of fate must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be forced to declare all actions
    that it will take on its next turn and be unable to change them. These actions
    are declared in the same manner as readied actions. If a declared action is impossible
    to complete or becomes impossible to perform (such as performing a full attack
    on a creature that is no longer adjacent), that action is lost. The irii is aware
    of what actions an affected creature intends to take. A nondetection spell renders
    a creature's fate unreadable and negates this effect. Iriis are immune to the
    auras of other iriis. The save DC is Wisdom-based.
  Chronosurge (Ex): An irii gets two turns each round, one on its initiative count
    and another on its initiative count - 10.
  Curse of Time (Su): An irii can rewind or fast-forward a target's personal timestream,
    crippling the victim with age or inducing temporary amnesia by rewinding the victim's
    memories. A creature that takes damage from an irii's sword attack becomes exhausted
    or feebleminded (as per feeblemind) for 1 round by this effect unless it succeeds
    at a DC 28 Fortitude save. Once a creature successfully saves against an irii's
    curse of time, it is immune to that particular irii's curse of time for 24 hours.
    Immunity to magical aging prevents this curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Frozen Moment (Su): Up to three times per day as a swift action, an irii can freeze
    time around itself for the duration of its turn. This does not grant the irii
    additional actions, but it prevents creatures from taking attacks of opportunity
    or readied actions against the irii while this ability is active.
  Temporal Insight (Ex): An irii gains an insight bonus to its Armor Class equal to
    its Intelligence modifier (+7 for most iriis).
  Temporal Mastery (Su): |-
    Whenever a creature within 60 feet of an irii uses time stop, the irii can act normally as if it had cast time stop itself. As neither the irii nor the caster is frozen in time with respect to the other, each can target and affect the other with attacks, spells, or other effects they create, though neither can affect frozen creatures for the duration of the time stop. This ability functions even if the irii is flat-footed or unaware of its opponent.

     Additionally, an irii can always take actions in a surprise round.
  Temporal Manipulation (Su): |-
    An irii's specific temporal manipulation abilities depend upon its alignment.

     Chaotic iriis can rewind time as an immediate action 3 times per day in response to being struck by a spell, spell-like ability, or attack, negating all damage and effects of the triggering action. Spells that predict the future-such as augury, divination, foresight, moment of prescience, and truestrike-cannot perceive chaotic iriis and provide no benefit against them or information about them.

     Lawful iriis weigh their foes down with knowledge of their inexorable futures. A creature must roll twice and take the lowest result on attack rolls and caster level checks to overcome spell resistance against a lawful irii, and cannot use abilities to force the irii to reroll a successful d20 roll or to roll multiple times and take a lower result.
desc_long: |-
  Iriis are natives of the Dimension of Time, but are often mistaken for angels or fey. Iriis have two distinct variants depending on their beliefs and roles with regard to time, and are locked in a civil war over their differing philosophies. Iriis who view time as rigid and immutable are lawful neutral and refer to themselves as Fates; they have the heads of animals-usually big cats, jackals, bulls, or beetles-and wings made out of glass and gold, with unblinking eyes encircling their necks. Iriis who see time as elastic and entropic are chaotic neutral and call themselves Fortunes; they have human faces, golden horns, and insectile wings. Due to their constant battles over ethos, these two aspects were considered to be entirely different species, until a Fate was observed bursting open and releasing a Fortune from within its body. Further study confirmed that Fortunes can likewise become more rigid in outlook and transform into Fates. What triggers these changes in aspect is unknown, but interviews with the iriis themselves suggest a single irii may be composed of multiple Fates and Fortunes, and they appear as separate creatures only because their appearances are filtered through mortals' unsophisticated perceptions of time and reality.

   Iriis are gregarious despite their alien mind-sets. While they most often remain in the Dimension of Time, fighting to either destroy or preserve alternate timelines that never became reality, they are known to don mortal guises and walk the Material Plane. Diviners and those who meddle with time, as well as major events in history, attract iriis, sometimes prompting them to stay and work toward their own peculiar ends. Fate iriis believe that both the past and future are set in stone, and consider anything that attempts to change either to be world-threatening meddling; they help prophecies and destinies come to pass and harry those who would alter history. Fortune iriis delight in destroying predetermined events as well as subtly modifying those that have past, splicing portions of alternate histories into the timeline to replace events that have been rendered impossible by temporal tampering. All iriis work to preserve the timestream, however- though Fates and Fortunes disagree on how elastic time is, they both agree that it should flow smoothly from prior actions into future consequences. As such, they always band together to defend the timeline from events and powers that could devour the past, erase the future, or destroy the integrity of time itself, shattering existence into an endless series of temporal paradoxes.

   Though iriis are rarely malicious in their actions, they are unsafe creatures by any metric. Their relationship with time means they rarely see a creature's death as an ending, causing iriis to sometimes act callous toward others. They can be invaluable patrons to people they take an interest in, especially scholars who seek out mysteries beyond the known multiverse, but these mysteries tend not to be healthy for mortal minds-and once an irii's attention is gained, there is no escaping it in any timeline.

   The average irii stands 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds in its true form.

### Special Abilities

**Aura of Fate (Su)** A creature that ends its turn within an _[[monsters/Irii|irii]]_’s 30-foot-radius aura of fate must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be forced to declare all actions that it will take on its next turn and be unable to change them. These actions are declared in the same manner as readied actions. If a declared action is impossible to complete or becomes impossible to perform (such as performing a full attack on a creature that is no longer adjacent), that action is lost. The _irii_ is aware of what actions an affected creature intends to take. A _[[spells/Nondetection|nondetection]]_ spell renders a creature’s fate unreadable and negates this effect. Iriis are immune to the auras of other iriis. The save DC is Wisdom-based.

**Chronosurge (Ex)** An _irii_ gets two turns each round, one on its initiative count and another on its initiative count – 10.

**Curse of Time (Su)** An _irii_ can rewind or fast-forward a target’s personal timestream, crippling the victim with age or inducing temporary _[[spells/Amnesia|amnesia]]_ by rewinding the victim’s memories. A creature that takes damage from an _irii_’s sword attack becomes _[[conditions/Exhausted|exhausted]]_ or feebleminded (as per _[[spells/Feeblemind|feeblemind]]_) for 1 round by this effect unless it succeeds at a DC 28 Fortitude save. Once a creature successfully saves against an _irii_’s curse of time, it is immune to that particular _irii_’s curse of time for 24 hours. _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|Immunity]]_ to magical aging prevents this curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Frozen Moment (Su)** Up to three times per day as a swift action, an _irii_ can _[[universal monster rules/Freeze|freeze]]_ time around itself for the duration of its turn. This does not grant the _irii_ additional actions, but it prevents creatures from taking attacks of opportunity or readied actions against the _irii_ while this ability is active.

##### Description

Iriis are natives of the Dimension of Time, but are often mistaken for angels or fey. Iriis have two distinct variants depending on their beliefs and roles with regard to time, and are locked in a civil war over their differing philosophies. Iriis who view time as rigid and immutable are lawful neutral and refer to themselves as Fates; they have the heads of animals—usually big cats, jackals, bulls, or beetles—and wings made out of glass and gold, with unblinking eyes encircling their necks.

Due to their constant battles over ethos, these two aspects were considered to be entirely different species, until a Fate was observed bursting open and releasing a Fortune from within its body. Further study confirmed that Fortunes can likewise become more rigid in outlook and transform into Fates.

Iriis are gregarious despite their alien mind-sets. While they most often remain in the Dimension of Time, fighting to either destroy or _[[spells/Preserve|preserve]]_ alternate timelines that never became reality, they are known to don mortal guises and walk the Material Plane. Diviners and those who meddle with time, as well as major events in history, attract iriis, sometimes prompting them to stay and work toward their own peculiar ends.
