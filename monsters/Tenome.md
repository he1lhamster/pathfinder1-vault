  Bone Drink (Su): Any round in which a tenome establishes or maintains a pin, it
    attaches its mouth to the victim and uses a sonic attack that liquefies the victim's
    bones, allowing the monster to drink them through flesh and skin. This deals 1d3
    points of Constitution damage to the victim. A creature damaged in this way must
    succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or be fatigued by the pain. A fatigued
    creature is instead exhausted, and an exhausted creature is rendered unconscious
    for 1 minute. A tenome regains 5 hit points for each round that it drinks liquefied
    bone. If a creature's Constitution score is reduced to 0 in this way, its skeleton
    is liquefied and it dies. This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Burst of Speed (Ex): A tenome can move twice its base speed once every 1d4 rounds.
  Obscuring Grapple (Ex): While a tenome is grappling a creature, all other opponents
    gain total concealment against the tenome.
  Terrifying Gaze (Su): A tenome can gaze at one opponent within 30 feet by presenting
    one of its eyes (a standard action) or both of its eyes (a full-round action).
    An opponent that fails a DC 14 Will save is frightened if it is the target of
    a single eye's gaze, or paralyzed if it is the target of both eyes. These effects
    last for 1d3 rounds. A tenome must activate its gaze attack; opponents need not
    attempt saving throws if they otherwise meet the tenome's gaze. Once a creature
    succeeds at its save against this ability, it is immune to that tenome's terrifying
    gaze for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  Tenomes are hideous predators that stalk the fringes of civilization, ambushing travelers and invading the homes of rural families to feast on their bones. They typically try to get close to their victims before attacking, hiding the monstrous elements of their appearance with hooded cloaks or voluminous robes, or lying in wait along darkened trails. They avoid attacking groups that heavily outnumber them, preferring to patiently track potential prey and strike when they can take victims one at a time. 

  Nocturnal creatures, tenomes often travel miles from their lairs under the cover of night to terrorize rural communities. They typically rotate their hunting grounds and try to cover their tracks when farmers organize to defend their lands or locate the tenomes' lairs. Their preferred diet of liquefied bones results in hideous corpses that can cause incredible fear in communities, and tenomes know this-they often seek to leave their boneless victims on display where they know the disgusting bodies will soon be found to deter pursuit. 

  Certain folktales suggest that tenomes originated as a supernatural punishment for a community that did not adequately care for its elderly. Whatever their true genesis was, these frightening monsters can now be found throughout the world, although they prefer to dwell in the fringes of urban regions. A tenome stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs around 150 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**Bone Drink (Su)** Any round in which a _[[monsters/Tenome|tenome]]_ establishes or maintains a pin, it attaches its mouth to the victim and uses a sonic attack that liquefies the victim’s bones, allowing the monster to drink them through flesh and skin. This deals 1d3 points of Constitution damage to the victim. A creature damaged in this way must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or be _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_ by the pain. A _fatigued_ creature is instead _[[conditions/Exhausted|exhausted]]_, and an _exhausted_ creature is rendered _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_ for 1 minute. A _tenome_ regains 5 hit points for each round that it drinks liquefied bone. If a creature’s Constitution score is reduced to 0 in this way, its skeleton is liquefied and it dies. This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**_Burst of Speed_ (Ex)** A _tenome_ can move twice its base speed once every 1d4 rounds.

**Obscuring Grapple (Ex)** While a _tenome_ is grappling a creature, all other opponents gain total concealment against the _tenome_.

**Terrifying _Gaze_ (Su)** A _tenome_ can _gaze_ at one opponent within 30 feet by presenting one of its eyes (a standard action) or both of its eyes (a full-round action). An opponent that fails a DC 14 Will save is _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_ if it is the target of a single eye’s _gaze_, or _[[conditions/Paralyzed|paralyzed]]_ if it is the target of both eyes. These effects last for 1d3 rounds. A _tenome_ must activate its _gaze_ attack; opponents need not attempt saving throws if they otherwise meet the _tenome_’s _gaze_. Once a creature succeeds at its save against this ability, it is immune to that _tenome_’s terrifying _gaze_ for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effect.

##### Description

Tenomes are hideous predators that stalk the fringes of civilization, ambushing travelers and invading the homes of rural families to feast on their bones.

Nocturnal creatures, tenomes often travel miles from their lairs under the cover of night to terrorize rural communities. They typically rotate their hunting grounds and try to cover their tracks when farmers organize to defend their lands or locate the tenomes’ lairs. Their preferred diet of liquefied bones results in hideous corpses that can cause incredible _fear_ in communities, and tenomes know this—they often seek to leave their boneless victims on display where _[[spells/They Know|they know]]_ the disgusting bodies will soon be found to deter pursuit.

Certain folktales suggest that tenomes originated as a supernatural punishment for a community that did not adequately care for its elderly. Whatever their true genesis was, these frightening monsters can now be found throughout the world, although they prefer to dwell in the fringes of urban regions.
