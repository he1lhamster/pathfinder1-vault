  Not quite man nor ape, the kech is a hairless primate that dwells in the deepest jungles. There they live in sizable tribes, relying upon their uncanny coloration and skill with bows to hunt prey. The green-and-brown camouflage coloration of a kech's flesh shifts and adapts to all surroundings to aid in stealth, but works particularly well in forests or jungles. This, combined with its uncanny ability to move through any terrain and leave no trace of its passage, makes the kech a masterful ambush hunter. A kech is 6 feet tall and weighs 240 pounds.

  These creatures prefer to dwell in ruined jungle buildings, and when presented with an opportunity to seize a remote town, slaughter the citizens, and move in, the typical kech tribe does not hesitate. Keches are as cruel as they are stealthy, and most jungle villages do not realize that they are under attack by a band of keches until the battle is already decided, with more than half the village dead in their beds, never having had the chance to awake and sound an alarm. Once a village does rouse to mount a resistance, the keches often seek to subdue remaining victims rather than kill them. Those who are slaughtered are inevitably eaten within 24 hours as part of a tremendous victory feast. Prisoners are often kept in cages in close proximity to the feasting, for keches enjoy the sound of wailing as their victims watch their kin being consumed.

  A kech tribe is typically led by a chieftain with 2-4 levels of ranger or fighter. Keches value magical support, particularly divine magic, for the jungle has no shortage of methods to wound, poison, or sicken those who dwell within. A kech cleric is as likely to worship an evil deity as it is one of the Four Horsemen or an evil elemental lord, but most kech priests are in fact druids. The combination of restorative magic and power over the natural world is often too seductive a path for a devout kech to ignore. Kech druids typically take apes as animal companions, and even tribes that lack druids generally have a few well-trained guard apes among them.

  Cannibalism is seen as a particularly vile taboo by keches-this prohibition extends to the consumption of ape or monkey flesh, but notably does not extend to the flesh of humanoids.

##### Description

Not quite man nor ape, the _kech_ is a hairless primate that dwells in the deepest jungles. There they live in sizable tribes, relying upon their uncanny coloration and skill with bows to hunt prey. The green-and-brown camouflage coloration of a _kech_’s flesh shifts and adapts to all surroundings to aid in stealth, but works particularly well in forests or jungles. This, combined with its uncanny ability to move through any terrain and leave no trace of its passage, makes the _kech_ a masterful ambush _[[classes/Hunter|hunter]]_. A _kech_ is 6 feet tall and weighs 240 pounds.

These creatures prefer to dwell in ruined jungle buildings, and when presented with an opportunity to seize a remote town, slaughter the citizens, and move in, the typical _kech_ tribe does not hesitate. Keches are as _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_ as they are _[[feats/Stealthy|stealthy]]_, and most jungle villages do not realize that they are under attack by a band of keches until the battle is already decided, with more than half the village dead in their beds, never having had the chance to awake and sound an _[[spells/Alarm|alarm]]_. Once a village does rouse to _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_ a _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_, the keches often seek to subdue remaining victims rather than kill them. Those who are slaughtered are inevitably eaten within 24 hours as part of a tremendous victory feast. Prisoners are often kept in cages in close proximity to the feasting, for keches enjoy the sound of wailing as their victims watch their kin being consumed.

A _kech_ tribe is typically led by a chieftain with 2–4 levels of _[[classes/Ranger|ranger]]_ or _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_. Keches value magical support, particularly divine magic, for the jungle has no shortage of methods to wound, poison, or sicken those who dwell within. A _kech_ _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ is as likely to worship an evil deity as it is one of the Four Horsemen or an evil elemental lord, but most _kech_ priests are in fact druids. The combination of restorative magic and power over the natural world is often too seductive a path for a devout _kech_ to ignore. _Kech_ druids typically take apes as animal companions, and even tribes that lack druids generally have a few well-trained _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_ apes among them.

Cannibalism is seen as a particularly vile taboo by keches—this prohibition extends to the _[[feats/Consumption|consumption]]_ of ape or monkey flesh, but notably does not extend to the flesh of humanoids.
