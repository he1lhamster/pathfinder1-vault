  Malevolence (Su): Once per round, a dybbuk can merge itself with a creature on the
    Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 18th),
    except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the dybbuk
    must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful
    DC 26 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same dybbuk's
    malevolence for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Pain Touch (Su): With a successful touch attack, a dybbuk causes painful spasms
    throughout the target's body, dealing 7d6 points of damage. Creatures that are
    immune to pain take no damage from this touch.
  Possess Object (Su): A dybbuk can use its malevolence ability to possess a Large
    or smaller unattended object, animating it as if using animate objects, except
    the dybbuk merges with and controls the object as if it were a living creature.
    The dybbuk cannot speak or use its other special abilities while possessing the
    object.
desc_long: A dybbuk is a misplaced soul who has eluded judgment because of a some
  great transgression or a pitiful suicide. Like a ghost, it lingers on in the mortal
  world, either trying to fulfill an insane need to right some great failure that
  has marked its soul for eternity or merely to spread the torment it is condemned
  to face for eternity. Bodiless and left to wander, dybbuks grow increasingly bitter
  and resentful over the loss of their bodies and endlessly seek mortal or even inanimate
  forms to steal and use to sow suffering. Vile manipulators, they seek bodies that
  have the greatest potential to cause pain in those closest to their victims, taking
  pleasure in shifting a leader's agenda toward the destruction of her followers or
  torturing an innocent from within. Dybbuks also often animate unliving things to
  spread fear, reveling in the chaos resulting from manipulating corpses to confuse
  and terrify. Most also realize they have all of eternity to torment their chosen
  victims, and might lurk quietly near a living target for weeks or months, waiting
  for the right moment to act and begin their terrors anew.

##### Description

A _dybbuk_ is a misplaced soul who has eluded judgment because of a some great transgression or a pitiful suicide. Like a _[[monsters/Ghost|ghost]]_, it lingers on in the mortal world, either trying to fulfill an insane need to right some great failure that has marked its soul for eternity or merely to spread the torment it is condemned to face for eternity. Bodiless and left to wander, dybbuks grow increasingly _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Bitter|bitter]]_ and resentful over the loss of their bodies and endlessly seek mortal or even inanimate forms to steal and use to sow suffering. Vile manipulators, they seek bodies that have the greatest potential to cause pain in those closest to their victims, taking pleasure in shifting a leader’s agenda toward the _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ of her followers or torturing an innocent from within. Dybbuks also often animate unliving things to spread _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_, reveling in the chaos resulting from manipulating corpses to confuse and terrify. Most also realize they have all of eternity to torment their chosen victims, and might lurk quietly near a living target for weeks or months, waiting for the right moment to act and begin their terrors anew.
