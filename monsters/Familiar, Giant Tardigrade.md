  Hardy (Ex): A giant tardigrade is able to endure extreme conditions for extended
    periods of time. It is unharmed by extreme cold, extreme heat, and less extreme
    temperatures. It takes no damage from decompression (such as in the vacuum of
    space) or high-pressure environments (such as in extremely deep water).
desc_long: Giant tardigrades, sometimes referred to as water bears, are miniscule,
  eight-legged creatures that live in water but can survive almost anywhere. The giant
  tardigrade grows as large as 1 foot in length and feeds on patches of bacteria,
  fungus, and plant matter.
