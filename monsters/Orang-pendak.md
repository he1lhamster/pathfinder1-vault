##### Description

Orang-pendaks are a rare offshoot of the _sasquatch_

species that dwells in remote mountainous jungles.

Elusive and shy, they are rarely seen by other races. Given

their friendship with apes (gibbons and orangutans in

particular) and their hunched posture and shaggy fur—

ranging from tawny or reddish to dark brown or black—

they are often mistaken for those beasts at a distance.

Orang-pendaks train apes and monkeys to hunt and

fight for them, but despite the friendship and similar

appearance, the species are not closely related.

Within their remote holds, Orang-pendaks cluster

together into seminomadic tribes, hunting and gathering

in a region until food and game becomes scarce, then

moving on to the next area. Many tribes follow a regional

pattern to this migration, allowing parts of the jungle to

repopulate and gathering only enough substance so as

not to disrupt the land’s ability to recoup the losses.

Orang-pendaks range from 3 to 5 feet tall as adults,

weighing up to 150 pounds, and they are quite strong for

their size. Orang-pendaks are largely herbivorous, but

sometimes hunt with spears, clubs, and _bolas_.
