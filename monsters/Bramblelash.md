    It's a move action to remove one thorn (a character can also remove a thorn from
    an adjacent ally as a move action).
  Camouflage (Ex): Since a bramblelash looks like a normal plant when at rest, a successful
    DC 20 Perception check is required to notice it before it attacks for the first
    time. Knowledge (nature) or Survival can be used instead of Perception for this
    check.
desc_long: The bramblelash uses its sharp leaves and thorns to cut animals that stray
  too close to its patch. Its victims' blood (and the carcasses of those that don't
  escape) enriches the soil and enables the bramblelash to thrive. The carnivorous
  plant won't pursue fleeing animals, and its slow speed would make such a course
  of action fruitless in any case. The bramblelash is content to bleed enemies and
  then feed off their organic contribution while they escape.

### Special Abilities

**Breakage (Ex)** If the _[[monsters/Bramblelash|bramblelash]]_ scores a critical hit against an opponent, 1d4 thorns break off in the victim’s flesh. As long as the thorns remain embedded, the victim takes a –2 penalty on attack and damage rolls due to the _[[universal monster rules/Distraction|distraction]]_. It’s a move action to remove one thorn (a character can also remove a thorn from an adjacent ally as a move action).

**Camouflage (Ex)** Since a _bramblelash_ looks like a normal plant when at rest, a successful DC 20 Perception check is required to notice it before it attacks for the first time. Knowledge (nature) or Survival can be used instead of Perception for this check.

##### Description

The _bramblelash_ uses its sharp leaves and thorns to cut animals that stray too close to its patch. Its victims’ blood (and the carcasses of those that don’t escape) enriches the soil and enables the _bramblelash_ to thrive. The carnivorous plant won’t pursue fleeing animals, and its _[[spells/Slow|slow]]_ speed would make such a course of action fruitless in any case. The _bramblelash_ is content to _bleed_ enemies and then feed off their organic contribution while they escape.
