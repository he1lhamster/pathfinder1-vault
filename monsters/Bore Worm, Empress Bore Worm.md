  Viviparous Birth (Ex): In an effort to preserve the next generation, an empress
    bore worm violently expunges any young .it may be carrying when it dies; these
    young function as 1d6 bore worm swarms (see page 82). In addition, the empress
    bore worm explodes in a burst of caustic blood and ichor, dealing 12d6 points

    The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: A single, finger-length bore worm has never been much of a threat to any
  one creature, but isolated bore worms are found only in laboratories. Bore worm
  swarms, as they are more commonly encountered, consume organic material with a voracious
  appetite, tunneling through the earth like water as they reach progressively larger
  sizes.
