**Static _Discharge_ (Su)** Once every 1d4 rounds as part of

a move action that’s taken to fly at least 10 feet, a

_[[monsters/Warmonger Wasp|warmonger wasp]]_’s wings can _discharge_ a bolt of electricity

to a range of up to 60 feet. The bolt explodes upon

reaching its target, creating a 20-foot-radius burst that

deals 6d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 15 half).

The save DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

Like the more powerful _[[monsters/Retriever|retriever]]_, the _warmonger wasp_ is a construct built

from the protoplasmic flesh and chaotic fecundity of

the Abyss itself. Partially organic and partially metallic,

_[[feats/Warmonger|warmonger]]_ wasps serve demonic armies as air support

in large battles. Their electricity-based explosions work

well on battlefields where demons and mortals clash, as

electrical attacks have no effect on demons. _Warmonger_

wasps are grown rather than constructed, and while the

procedure of crafting these constructs is beyond the ken

of mortal crafters, spellcasters can conjure them to do

their bidding. _Warmonger_ wasps are only intelligent

enough to understand simple commands, and even then

they generally understand only commands universally

associated with battlefield conditions.

A _warmonger wasp_ is about 10 feet long, has a 20-foot

wingspan, and weighs 1,200 pounds.
