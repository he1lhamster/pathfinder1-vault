  Karkadanns roam the barren and wind-swept deserts of the world where their deep bellows can be heard for miles. Their solitary horns have led many to assume that they are a breed or variant of unicorn, but karkadanns bristle at that claim.

   Known for their aggression and physical power, karkadanns are proud warriors that rarely back down from a fight. They readily charge into combat, seeking to impale their foes on their wicked horns. Legend says that the only thing that can calm an enraged karkadann is the song of a ring dove.

   Some desert travelers seek out karkadanns because of their mystical ability to purge a creature of toxins. Many a traveler stung by a giant scorpion or bitten by a viper hopes for nothing more than to come across a karkadann. This treatment isn't granted lightly. Karkadanns are narcissistic and self-serving, so they often demand outlandish favors in return for curing a poisoned creature. They size up what the person can reliably pay and demand just a bit more. Some alchemists, however, have learned that the ability to purge poisons isn't just supernatural, and that some part of that power lies within the karkadann's devious horn.

##### Description

Karkadanns roam the barren and wind-swept deserts of the world where their deep _[[items/Mundane/Bellows|bellows]]_ can be heard for miles. Their solitary horns have led many to assume that they are a breed or variant of _[[monsters/Unicorn|unicorn]]_, but karkadanns _bristle_ at that claim.

Known for their aggression and physical power, karkadanns are proud warriors that rarely back down from a fight. They readily charge into combat, seeking to impale their foes on their wicked horns. Legend says that the only thing that can calm an enraged _karkadann_ is the song of a ring dove.

Some desert travelers seek out karkadanns because of their mystical ability to purge a creature of toxins. Many a traveler stung by a giant scorpion or bitten by a viper hopes for nothing more than to come across a _karkadann_. This treatment isn’t granted lightly. Karkadanns are narcissistic and self-serving, so they often _[[spells/Demand|demand]]_ outlandish favors in return for curing a poisoned creature. They size up what the person can reliably pay and _demand_ just a bit more. Some alchemists, however, have learned that the ability to purge poisons isn’t just supernatural, and that some part of that power lies within the _karkadann_’s devious horn.
