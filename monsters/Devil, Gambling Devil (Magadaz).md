  Double Down (Su): A gambling devil's understanding of probability is so good that
    it knows the best moment to play its hand, even if that means having to lose one
    first. As an immediate action, anytime a gambling devil rolls a d20 (for an attack
    roll, a saving throw, or a skill check), it can take a luck penalty of up to 1/2
    of its Charisma modifier on the roll (-2 for most magadazes). The next time within
    1 minute it attempts a d20 roll of the same category (for example, if the first
    roll was a skill check, the second can be any skill check), it gains a luck bonus
    to the roll equal to double the penalty taken earlier (+4 for most magadazes).
  Produce Coins (Su): A gambling devil can produce up to 50 gold coins by drawing
    them from its body as a free action. Typically, a magadaz uses this ability to
    pay its debts at a gaming table, but it must successfully use Sleight of Hand
    if it wishes to conceal the supernatural nature of this ability from any observers.
    Coins produced in this way disappear 1 hour after leaving the gambling devil's
    possession. In addition, a gambling devil can use these coins as weapons, turning
    them into dangerous thrown projectiles. Each coin deals 1d4 points of bludgeoning
    damage and counts as evil, lawful, and magic for the purpose of overcoming damage
    reduction. A gambling devil can produce a number of gold coins per day equal to
    50 × its Constitution score (850 coins for most gambling devils).
  Risk Aura (Su): The presence of a gambling devil encourages nearby creatures to
    make riskier decisions and take bigger gambles. Any creature within 30 feet of
    a gambling devil must succeed at a DC 16 Will saving throw each round or be compelled
    to throw caution to the wind so long as it remains within the aura's effects.
    Whenever a situation calls for a d20 roll, any creature affected by this ability
    must roll twice. If either roll is a natural 20, the affected creature can use
    that roll. Otherwise, it must use the lower of the two results. A gambling devil
    can suppress or reactivate this aura as a swift action. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  Gambling devils, also known as magadazes, are born from the damned souls of mortal gamblers, bookies, and even moneylenders. Although they can be found throughout Hell and even on the Material Plane, they are most numerous in Erebus, the third layer of Hell, where they use their immense luck and cunning to serve the archdevil Mammon, Hell's accountant and treasurer. In addition to their pathological love of and skill at gambling, magadazes are known for their willingness to provide ledgers claiming anything that their customers-usually diabolists or other foolish souls-might desire. Common requests include paperwork proving clients' destitution or statements showing that their vaults overflow with gold and jewels.

  To pay for this creative accounting, the client must simply engage the gambling devil in a game of chance. Sometimes these competitions are even fair (or as fair as any such game can be), but a gambling devil's unique skills give even the toss of a coin poor odds. This, coupled with a magadaz's ability to encourage risk-taking, means that gambling devils have caused many mortals to lose everything they own. Gambling with magadazes almost always seems fair until the devils miraculously win at the last moment.

  Some believe that magadazes are extensions of Mammon's reach, tempting mortals away from their wealth and siphoning it into Erebus's innumerable vaults. But gambling devils also simply take pleasure in manipulating chaos to force probability toward their own advantage-or that of their patron. Gambling devils vary widely in shape and size, but they stand 5-1/2 feet tall on average. Their incredible density, however, results in them weighing an average of 500 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**Double Down (Su)** A gambling devil’s understanding of probability is so good that it knows the best moment to play its hand, even if that means having to lose one first. As an immediate action, anytime a gambling devil rolls a d20 (for an attack roll, a saving throw, or a skill check), it can take a luck penalty of up to 1/2 of its Charisma modifier on the roll (–2 for most magadazes).

Typically, a magadaz uses this ability to pay its debts at a gaming table, but it must successfully use Sleight of Hand if it wishes to conceal the supernatural nature of this ability from any observers. Coins produced in this way disappear 1 hour after leaving the gambling devil’s _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_. In addition, a gambling devil can use these coins as weapons, turning them into dangerous thrown projectiles. Each coin deals 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage and counts as evil, lawful, and magic for the purpose of overcoming _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_. A gambling devil can produce a number of gold coins per day equal to 50 × its Constitution score (850 coins for most gambling devils).

**Risk Aura (Su)** The presence of a gambling devil encourages nearby creatures to make riskier decisions and take bigger gambles. Any creature within 30 feet of a gambling devil must succeed at a DC 16 Will saving throw each round or be compelled to throw caution to the wind so long as it remains within the aura’s effects.

##### Description

Gambling devils, also known as magadazes, are born from the _[[feats/Damned|damned]]_ souls of mortal gamblers, bookies, and even moneylenders. Although they can be found throughout Hell and even on the Material Plane, they are most numerous in Erebus, the third layer of Hell, where they use their immense luck and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cunning|cunning]]_ to serve the archdevil Mammon, Hell’s accountant and treasurer. In addition to their pathological love of and skill at gambling, magadazes are known for their willingness to provide ledgers claiming anything that their customers—usually diabolists or other foolish souls—might desire. Common requests include paperwork proving clients’ destitution or statements showing that their vaults overflow with gold and jewels.
