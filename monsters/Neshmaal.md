  Aura of Alien Dread (Su): A neshmaal's presence is deeply disturbing. Any creature
    that comes within 20 feet of a neshmaal must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or become
    shaken for 2d4 rounds. If a creature is within the auras of multiple neshmaals,
    only a single save is required, but the save DC increases by 2 for each additional
    neshmaal (for example, the presence of two neshmaals increases the usual save
    DC to 25). Arcane spellcasters are especially vulnerable to this aura. The DC
    to cast spells defensively within the aura increases by 4, and the neshmaal can
    make an attack of opportunity against an arcane caster who fails to cast defensively.
    This secondary effect occurs even if the arcane caster succeeded at her save against
    the shaken condition. Once a creature is exposed to a neshmaal's aura, it is immune
    to this effect for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save
    DC is Constitution-based.
  Dominate Person (Sp): A neshmaal can dominate only one target at a time when using
    its dominate person spell-like ability. If a neshmaal uses its dominate person
    spell-like ability on a new target while already dominating another creature,
    the previous target is immediately released from the neshmaal's control. This
    occurs whether or not the new attempt is successful.
  Kiss of the Void (Su): Three times per day, a neshmaal may forgo using energy drain
    on one of its three tendril attacks in a round and instead imbue the touch with
    the icy coldness of deep space. This attack deals an additional 6d6 points of
    cold damage and paralyzes the target for 1d4-1 rounds. A successful DC 23 Fortitude
    save halves the damage and negates the paralysis. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Vulnerability to Sonic (Su): Neshmaals are native to the noiseless void of deep
    space or their own alien dimension and, as a result, are especially vulnerable
    to sonic damage. Magical attacks that cause sonic damage bypass the neshmaal's
    spell resistance, and they take half again as much damage (+50%) on a failed save
    (normal full damage on a successful save). If a neshmaal fails a saving throw
    against an effect that deals sonic damage, it has a 25% chance of being stunned
    for 1 round.
desc_long: |-
  The vast, dark spaces between the stars hold horrors aplenty, skulking in the unholy blackness with their aberrant desires and unspeakable appetites. Some of these beings exist simultaneously in two worlds, half in the emptiness of space and half in some other dimension of which mortals dare not even dream. The neshmaals are such a race, aliens of such inscrutable malice and hunger that even most other denizens of the darkness avoid them. These strange beings view the humanoids populating the universe as either cattle to eat or playthings to manipulate like marionettes.

  A neshmaal's body is formed of a tangle of writhing tentacles that is roughly 9 feet across. As they are incorporeal outside of their home dimension, the creatures have no weight.

### Special Abilities

**Aura of Alien Dread (Su)** A _[[monsters/Neshmaal|neshmaal]]_’s presence is deeply disturbing. Any creature that comes within 20 feet of a _neshmaal_ must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or become _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 2d4 rounds. If a creature is within the auras of multiple neshmaals, only a single save is required, but the save DC increases by 2 for each additional _neshmaal_ (for example, the presence of two neshmaals increases the usual save DC to 25). Arcane spellcasters are especially vulnerable to this aura. The DC to cast spells defensively within the aura increases by 4, and the _neshmaal_ can make an attack of opportunity against an arcane caster who fails to cast defensively. This secondary effect occurs even if the arcane caster succeeded at her save against the _shaken_ condition. Once a creature is exposed to a _neshmaal_’s aura, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.

**_Dominate Person_ (Sp)** A _neshmaal_ can dominate only one target at a time when using its _dominate person_ spell-like ability. If a _neshmaal_ uses its _dominate person_ spell-like ability on a new target while already dominating another creature, the previous target is immediately released from the _neshmaal_’s control. This occurs whether or not the new attempt is successful.

**Kiss of the Void (Su)** Three times per day, a _neshmaal_ may forgo using _energy drain_ on one of its three tendril attacks in a round and instead imbue the touch with the icy coldness of deep space. This attack deals an additional 6d6 points of cold damage and paralyzes the target for 1d4–1 rounds. A successful DC 23 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the _[[universal monster rules/Paralysis|paralysis]]_. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**_[[curses/Vulnerability|Vulnerability]]_ to Sonic (Su)** Neshmaals are native to the noiseless void of deep space or their own alien dimension and, as a result, are especially vulnerable to sonic damage. Magical attacks that cause sonic damage bypass the _neshmaal_’s _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_, and they take half again as much damage (+50%) on a failed save (normal full damage on a successful save). If a _neshmaal_ fails a saving throw against an effect that deals sonic damage, it has a 25% chance of being _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_ for 1 round.

##### Description

The vast, dark spaces between the stars hold horrors aplenty, skulking in the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Unholy|unholy]]_ blackness with their aberrant desires and unspeakable appetites. Some of these beings exist simultaneously in two worlds, half in the emptiness of space and half in some other dimension of which mortals dare not even _[[spells/Dream|dream]]_. The neshmaals are such a race, aliens of such inscrutable malice and hunger that even most other denizens of the _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_ avoid them. These strange beings view the humanoids populating the universe as either cattle to eat or playthings to manipulate like marionettes.

A _neshmaal_’s body is formed of a tangle of writhing tentacles that is roughly 9 feet across. As they are _incorporeal_ outside of their home dimension, the creatures have no weight.
