  Scrimshaw Magic (Sp): When a tupilaq is created, its creator can inscribe a single
    spell he knows (as long as that spell is no higher than 2nd level and requires
    no material components) into the tupilaq as a complex scrimshaw design. The tupilaq
    gains the ability to use that spell as a spell-like ability (CL 7th) three times
    per day. The tupilaq's creator can inscribe a new spell onto the tupilaq if he
    wishes, replacing the previous scrimshaw. Inscribing a new scrimshaw requires
    24 hours of work and an expenditure of 500 gp in materials. The tupilaq presented
    here utilizes invisibility in this manner. Erase can destroy a tupilaq's scrimshaw
    if it fails a Fortitude save against the spell. If a tupilaq's scrimshaw is removed
    in this manner, it loses access to the spell as a spell-like ability, and seeks
    out its creator to attack and kill him. The tupilaq's creator becomes the target
    of the tupilaq's seek target ability in this case. If a tupilaq's creator is already
    dead, the tupilaq instead seeks out the nearest living creature and attacks this
    new target on sight, continuing this spree of murder until it is itself destroyed.
  Seek Target (Su): A tupilaq's creator can place a drop of blood, lock of hair, or
    other portion of a creature's body in the tupilaq's maw as a standard action.
    From that point on, the tupilaq constantly knows what direction that creature
    is located in, and gains a +20 insight bonus on all Perception checks made to
    locate the creature. A new target cannot be assigned to a tupilaq in this manner
    until its previous target is dead.
  Shearing Jaws (Ex): All tupilaqs are crafted with oversized jaws capable of tearing
    and pulling. A tupilaq applies twice its Strength modifier to damage with a successful
    bite attack and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. A tupilaq is treated
    as Large for all checks made to move a grappled opponent.
desc_long: |-
  Tupilaqs are small constructs crafted out of whale bones and whale teeth for the sole purpose of murdering the creator's enemies. A tupilaq's appearance can vary based on its construction, but all have prominent jaws and a small body with hands and feet fit for swimming. A tupilaq usually stands 3 feet tall and weighs only 30 pounds.

  Tupilaqs must be created in secrecy-if any other person discovers the tupilaq is being created, the attempt to build the construct immediately fails. As part of its creation, the creator invites or lures a host spirit to possess the tupilaq. Most often, the animus of a tupilaq is that of a dead child or other small humanoid, and the parity of size between the new vessel and the spirit's previous body is what gives the creature a speed and agility on land and in water that is atypical for most constructs. This trapped spirit is also what makes a tupilaq so savage and murderous.

##### Description

Tupilaqs are small constructs crafted out of _[[monsters/Whale|whale]]_ bones and _whale_ teeth for the sole purpose of murdering the creator’s enemies. A _tupilaq_’s appearance can vary based on its construction, but all have prominent jaws and a small body with hands and feet fit for swimming. A _tupilaq_ usually stands 3 feet tall and weighs only 30 pounds.

Tupilaqs must be created in secrecy—if any other person discovers the _tupilaq_ is being created, the attempt to build the construct immediately fails. As part of its creation, the creator invites or lures a host spirit to possess the _tupilaq_. Most often, the animus of a _tupilaq_ is that of a dead child or other small humanoid, and the parity of size between the new vessel and the spirit’s previous body is what gives the creature a speed and agility on land and in water that is atypical for most constructs. This trapped spirit is also what makes a _tupilaq_ so savage and murderous.
