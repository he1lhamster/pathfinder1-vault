##### Description

Where the Plane of Earth borders the Plane of Water, a mixing of the fundamental elements occurs—it is in this borderland that the mud elementals dwell. Scorned by earth and water elementals, mud elementals usually look like vaguely recognizable blobs of mud in the shape of a Material Plane creature, whether a humanoid, an animal, or even an immense insect. The exact density of their muddy bodies varies—some might be composed of silty water, while others are thick, like river _[[items/Mundane/Clay|clay]]_. Large and powerful mud elementals tend to have worm-like, reptilian, or frog-like forms.
