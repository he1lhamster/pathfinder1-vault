##### Description

When a giant ant _[[monsters/Lion|lion]]_ reaches maturity, it creates a cocoon of sand and dirt around itself. Over the course of a month, the ant _lion_ undergoes a dramatic metamorphosis—when it emerges, its body has become elongated and thin and it has gained a set of enormous, lacy wings. Depending on the region, giant adult ant lions are often _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ giant lacewings, giant damselflies, or giant spindleflies, but regardless of their regional name, they remain _[[curses/Ravenous|ravenous]]_ and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_, replacing the sand trap _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cunning|cunning]]_ of their larval form with swift _[[universal monster rules/Flight|flight]]_ and greater battlefield _[[feats/Mobility|mobility]]_.
