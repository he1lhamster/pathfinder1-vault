# Rawhead
This slim figure’s proportions are wrong, and its disturbingly long

arms end in claws, save for an oversized, boneless index finger.

### Special Abilities

**_Bloody Bones_ Mastery (Su)** A _rawhead_ can sense the direction and condition of all _bloody bones_ within a 1-mile radius. This functions as if via a _[[spells/Status|status]]_ spell (even though undead normally cannot be affected by this spell).

**Charisma Damage (Su)** A _rawhead_’s tentacle fingers strip away flesh and emotion alike, dealing 1d4 points of Charisma damage on every hit with its claw attack (Will DC 23 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Create _Bloody Bones_ (Su)** A _rawhead_ can create a _bloody bones_ from a Small or _Medium_ _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_, living humanoid. As a full round action, the _rawhead_ extends its finger tentacle to pierce the creature’s flesh, ensnares its bones, and attempts to rip the creature’s skeleton free. This deals 10d6 points of damage to the victim. If the victim is _helpless_ as a result of Charisma damage, it takes 10d8 points of damage from this attack instead. If this damage is enough to reduce the creature’s hit points below 0, it is instantly slain as its skeleton is extracted from its body. The skeleton immediately animates as a _bloody bones_ (see page 49) under the _rawhead_’s control. This is a death effect.

**Hidden Terror (Ex)** A _rawhead_ can activate its _frightful presence_ ability as a swift action, and can affect creatures that are unaware of its presence or aren’t within line of sight.

##### Description

Some believe rawheads to be nothing more than figments from scary stories, typically associated with the childhood terror known as _bloody bones_ (see page 49). But others know rawheads to be all too real and live in _fear_ of attracting their attention.

A _rawhead_ stands almost 7 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.
