  Bag Prey (Su): |-
    If a bagman begins its turn with a creature grappled in its claws, as long as the creature is size Small or smaller, it can stuff the target into its sack as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A bagman can stuff a grappled Medium creature in the sack, but doing so is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A creature in the sack can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon. The sack has AC 12 and 15 hit points. If a creature cuts its way out of the sack or the sack is damaged enough to allow a victim to escape, the bagman cannot use the sack to bag prey again until it has spent 1 hour mending it.

     The sack has other special qualities while in the bagman's possession. The weight of creatures in the sack do not count against the bagman's carrying capacity, and the bagman can fit up to two Small creatures or one Medium creature in the sack at a time. If used by any creature other than the bagman that owns it, this container functions as a mundane sack. If a bagman's sack is lost or destroyed, it can craft a new sack with proper materials and a week of work.
  Fat Extractor (Su): A bagman can use the fat of intelligent humanoid creatures to
    create potions of infernal healing and potions of youthful appearance as if it
    had the Brew Potion feat. These potions are created at caster level 3rd, and the
    fat from one humanoid creature of any size is enough to make a single potion.
    Creating each potion takes 2 hours, and requires the bagman to flense the fat
    from its victims' flesh with its claws, place the fat in a cauldron over an open
    fire, and mix it with whatever free ingredients are at hand. Unlike brewing a
    potion normally, creating these potions has no cost. A bagman can carry only four
    potions created in this way at a time, even if another bagman made them, but it
    can sell or give away an unlimited number of potions. Knowingly consuming one
    of these potions is an evil act.
  Find Children (Ex): A bagman has the scent ability, but only with respect to humanoid
    children. Thus, it could sniff out a human child's hiding place, but not the child's
    parents.
desc_long: Some monsters feed on humans, while others torture humans for their own
  sadistic pleasure, but few creatures go to such perverse lengths as to murder humans
  and then sell the processed remains back to their victims' unwitting families. Bagmen
  are such monsters- degenerate fey creatures who specialize in kidnapping humanoid
  victims and harvesting their fat to produce potions. Bagmen disguise themselves
  as traveling peddlers and apothecaries, often selling the products of their depredations
  to the very communities from which they steal their victims. An average bagman stands
  5-1/2 feet tall and weighs close to 300 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**Bag Prey (Su)** If a _[[monsters/Bagman|bagman]]_ begins its turn with a creature _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ in its claws, as long as the creature is size Small or smaller, it can stuff the target into its _sack_ as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A _bagman_ can stuff a _grappled_ _Medium_ creature in the _sack_, but doing so is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A creature in the _sack_ can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon. The _sack_ has AC 12 and 15 hit points. If a creature cuts its way out of the _sack_ or the _sack_ is damaged enough to allow a victim to escape, the _bagman_ cannot use the _sack_ to bag prey again until it has spent 1 hour _[[spells/Mending|mending]]_ it.

The _sack_ has other special qualities while in the _bagman_’s _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_. The weight of creatures in the _sack_ do not count against the _bagman_’s carrying capacity, and the _bagman_ can fit up to two Small creatures or one _Medium_ creature in the _sack_ at a time. If used by any creature other than the _bagman_ that owns it, this container functions as a mundane _sack_. If a _bagman_’s _sack_ is lost or destroyed, it can craft a new _sack_ with proper materials and a week of work.

**Fat Extractor (Su)** A _bagman_ can use the fat of intelligent humanoid creatures to create potions of _infernal healing_ and potions of _youthful appearance_ as if it had the _[[feats/Brew Potion|Brew Potion]]_ feat.

Knowingly consuming one of these potions is an evil act.

**Find Children (Ex)** A _bagman_ has the _[[universal monster rules/Scent|scent]]_ ability, but only with respect to humanoid children. Thus, it could sniff out a human child’s hiding place, but not the child’s parents.
