title1: Herald, Lawgiver
is_3.5: true
desc_short: The titanic golden statue of a great knight looms here, four times taller
  than even the most intimidating warrior. Bearing a gigantic hammer almost too large
  for it to hold, the sculpture depicts thick, rigid armor, but no details beneath,
  hiding the identity of the wearer. Upon its breast gleams a golden relief of runes,
  a key, and a shining city.

special_abilities:
  All Around Vision (Su): The Lawgiver is aware of everything around it at all times,
    providing it with a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Search checks. The Lawgiver cannot
    be flanked.
  Freeze (Ex): The Lawgiver can hold itself so still it appears to be a gigantic,
    golden statue. An observer must succeed on a DC 25 Spot check to notice the Lawgiver
    is really alive.
  Gavel of Abadar: The Gavel of Abadar is a Gargantuan warhammer that is treated as
    though it had the axiomatic weapon quality. Aside from dealing the usual +2d6
    points of damage to creatures of chaotic alignment, three times per day, as a
    standard action, the Lawgiver can touch a creature with the hammer. Any creature
    touched in this way is affected by the spells cure serious wounds, neutralize
    poison, remove blindness/deafness, remove curse, remove disease, and remove paralysis,
    as if cast by an 18th-level cleric. If the Gavel of Abadar is ever removed from
    the Lawgiver's hands, the herald can summon the weapon back to its hand as a standard
    action.
  Golden Body (Ex): The Lawgiver is a creature of living gold and blessed steel, granting
    it immunity to acid, electricity, critical hits, and rusting effects (such as
    the rusting grasp spell or a rust monster's rust attack).
  Herald of Abadar (Su): The Lawgiver can be summoned by clerics of Abadar using the
    spell gate or greater planar ally, despite any restrictions of those spells.
  See in Darkness (Su): The Lawgiver can see in darkness of any kind, even that created
    by spells like deeper darkness.
  Wings of Abadar (Su): As a free action, the Lawgiver can manifest a pair of gigantic
    golden wings. These wings grant the herald a flight speed of 60 feet with perfect
    maneuverability. The Lawgiver can dismiss its wings at will. Alternatively, as
    a standard action, the Lawgiver can take the form a two-headed golden eagle, one
    of Abadar's many symbols. The Lawgiver retains its normal hit points and bonus
    on Spot in this form, but otherwise has the same statistics and abilities of an
    eagle (MM 272).
desc_long: |-
  Abadar's herald is the Lawgiver, a golem-like creature of gold and consecrated steel. Massive and powerful, the divine emissary appears as a 25-foot-tall giant in elaborate golden armor and bearing a titanic warhammer. Standing still, the Lawgiver appears as a fantastic statue crafted in honor of the god of law. When active, its steps shake the earth and the blow of its legendary hammer-the godforged Gavel of Abadar-can shatter castle walls. Stoic, infinitely patient, and entirely dedicated to the Keeper of the First Vault, the Lawgiver is like an intelligent golden volcano: mountainous and indomitable, yet capable of exacting incredible destruction. This sentinel of civilization appears where the forces of chaos threaten to undo the works of lawful communities and hinder progress's inexorable march.

  Terse in nature, the herald of Abadar restricts communication to an unusual limit. Although the giant can speak several languages, it has only ever been heard speaking in numbers and measurements or-more frequently-in direct quotes from Abadar's holy writings, the Order of Numbers or the Manual of City Building. Encyclopedic in its knowledge of the god of cities's holy texts, this restriction rarely prevents the Lawgiver from making its intentions known.
