special_abilities:
  Blood Drain (Su): A nachzehrer can suck blood from a pinned opponent. If the nachzehrer
    establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution
    damage to its victim. The nachzehrer heals 10 hit points or gains 10 temporary
    hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to
    its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood.
  Bound to the Grave (Su): Nachzehrers are susceptible to certain rituals meant to
    keep them bound to their graves. Forcing a single coin into the mouth of a helpless
    nachzehrer (a full-round action) instantly incapacitates it. However, the nachzehrer
    is no longer incapacitated and can act as normal if this coin is removed, unless
    its head is also severed from its body (with the coin still in its mouth) and
    anointed with holy water, and both its body and head are buried at least 6 feet
    underground.
  Call the Fallen (Su): Once per day as a standard action while within any forest,
    the nachzehrer can harness the energies of the fey and humanoid creatures that
    have died nearby. This effectively causes 1d4 human juju zombies to rise from
    the earth in random places in a 30-foot radius around the nachzehrer. These juju
    zombies don't provoke attacks of opportunity when they rise in this way, are under
    the nachzehrer's control, and act on its turn. Juju zombies can't rise in this
    way from any surface that isn't natural soil (such as the floor of a structure
    or an area paved with natural rock or stone). Juju zombies the nachzehrer creates
    using this ability meld back into the earth after 24 hours and are permanently
    destroyed.
  Fey Disguise (Su): While in any forest, a nachzehrer can take on the illusory appearance
    of any Small or Medium fey creature. This does not affect the nachzehrer's statistics
    or give it any special abilities. A nachzehrer so disguised exposes its true nature
    through subtle mannerisms or flaws in its appearance, and anyone who interacts
    with the glamered nachzehrer can see through its disguise with a successful DC
    25 Perception or Sense Motive check or a DC 24 Will saving throw. The save DC
    is Charisma-based.
  Horrifying Vision (Su): A nachzehrer can channel the foul energy of the terrible
    fate that befell it into its slam attack. Creatures damaged by its slam attack
    are panicked for 1 round as their minds are assaulted with the terrible trauma
    the nachzehrer endured, but the target can reduce this effect to shaken with a
    successful DC 24 Will saving throw. A nachzehrer can choose not to inflict its
    horrifying vision on a creature it attacks. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
    The saving throw is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  The inspiration of much fear and dread among forest-dwellers, nachzehrers are better known as fey vampires in the woodland regions where they typically dwell. Human locals often confuse them for true vampires, though in reality nachzehrers are a form of monstrous cousin to those hated undead. They rise from the fey victims of virulent disease; the more evil a pestilence's origin, such as from an Abyssal blight, the more likely fey who succumb are to return as nachzehrers. Unlike true vampires, nachzehrers cannot create spawn, though their aggressiveness toward and hatred of the living is just as intense as those fabled horrors.

   Tragically, nachzehrers typically rise from good or neutral fey, such as dryads, huldras, nymphs, and nereids. Their appearances are sick parodies of the forms they took in life. Their graceful limbs become spindly and bony, their skin becomes thin and papery, and their delicate teeth sharpen into wicked fangs. Nachzehrers are typically 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh about 100 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**_Blood Drain_ (Su)** A _[[monsters/Nachzehrer|nachzehrer]]_ can suck blood from a _[[conditions/Pinned|pinned]]_ opponent. If the _nachzehrer_ establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage to its victim. The _nachzehrer_ heals 10 hit points or gains 10 temporary hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood.

**Bound to the Grave (Su)** Nachzehrers are susceptible to certain rituals meant to keep them bound to their graves. Forcing a single coin into the mouth of a _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ _nachzehrer_ (a full-round action) instantly incapacitates it. However, the _nachzehrer_ is no longer incapacitated and can act as normal if this coin is removed, unless its head is also severed from its body (with the coin still in its mouth) and anointed with _[[items/Mundane/Holy water|holy water]]_, and both its body and head are buried at least 6 feet underground.

**Call the _Fallen_ (Su)** Once per day as a standard action while within any forest, the _nachzehrer_ can harness the energies of the fey and humanoid creatures that have died nearby. This effectively causes 1d4 human juju zombies to rise from the earth in random places in a 30-foot radius around the _nachzehrer_. These juju zombies don’t provoke attacks of opportunity when they rise in this way, are under the _nachzehrer_’s control, and act on its turn. Juju zombies can’t rise in this way from any surface that isn’t natural soil (such as the floor of a structure or an area paved with natural rock or stone). Juju zombies the _nachzehrer_ creates using this ability meld back into the earth after 24 hours and are permanently destroyed.

**Fey Disguise (Su)** While in any forest, a _nachzehrer_ can take on the illusory appearance of any Small or _Medium_ fey creature. This does not affect the _nachzehrer_’s statistics or give it any special abilities. A _nachzehrer_ so disguised exposes its true nature through subtle mannerisms or flaws in its appearance, and anyone who interacts with the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Glamered|glamered]]_ _nachzehrer_ can see through its disguise with a successful DC 25 Perception or Sense Motive check or a DC 24 Will saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Horrifying _Vision_ (Su)** A _nachzehrer_ can channel the foul energy of the terrible fate that befell it into its slam attack. Creatures damaged by its slam attack are _[[conditions/Panicked|panicked]]_ for 1 round as their minds are assaulted with the terrible trauma the _nachzehrer_ endured, but the target can reduce this effect to _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ with a successful DC 24 Will saving throw. A _nachzehrer_ can choose not to inflict its horrifying _vision_ on a creature it attacks. This is a mind-affecting _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effect. The saving throw is Charisma-based.

##### Description

The inspiration of much _fear_ and dread among forest-dwellers, nachzehrers are better known as fey vampires in the woodland regions where they typically dwell. Human locals often confuse them for true vampires, though in reality nachzehrers are a form of monstrous cousin to those hated undead. They rise from the fey victims of _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Virulent|virulent]]_ disease; the more evil a pestilence’s origin, such as from an Abyssal _blight_, the more likely fey who succumb are to return as nachzehrers. Unlike true vampires, nachzehrers cannot create spawn, though their aggressiveness toward and hatred of the living is just as intense as those fabled horrors.
