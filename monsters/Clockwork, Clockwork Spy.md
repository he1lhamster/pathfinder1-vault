  Record Audio (Su): A clockwork spy can record nearby sounds as a swift action, archiving
    all sound within a 20-foot spread onto a small gemstone worth 50 gp embedded in
    its body. The clockwork spy can record up to 1 hour of sound per Hit Die it possesses.
    Starting and stopping playback of recorded sound is a swift action. Removing a
    gemstone or installing a gemstone into a clockwork spy requires a DC 25 Disable
    Device check as a full-round action-failure does not damage the gemstone but does
    erase any recorded sounds on the gemstone. Since clockwork spies are not intelligent,
    they must be given simple commands as to when they are to start recording sounds.
    A clockwork spy can differentiate between creature types and subtypes, but not
    between specific individuals-a spy can be ordered to start recording sound as
    soon as a humanoid (human) or an aberration comes in range, but it cannot be ordered
    to start recording when a specific person comes within range. Once a clockwork
    spy begins recording sound, it cannot cease recording early. Likewise, it cannot
    record sound onto a gemstone that already contains a recording.
  Self-Destruct (Su): Unless specifically programmed otherwise by its creator, a clockwork
    spy explodes 1 round after it is destroyed. During this round, the thing shrieks
    and thrashes about as if undergoing convulsions. On what would normally have been
    the clockwork spy's next action, it explodes, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage
    in a 5-foot radius (Reflex DC 10 for half damage). A DC 20 Disable Device check
    made as a standard action can halt the spy's self-destruct sequence, but does
    not prevent it from dying. A clockwork spy that self-destructs automatically destroys
    its gemstone, along with any information contained inside it. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
  These spindly and discreet mechanical arachnids are ideal for surveillance and reconnaissance missions, and can be vital tools in political intrigues or illicit consortium tactics. Their retractable, insectile wings make the swift creatures even craftier foes than most would anticipate. As they are less combat-oriented than many other clockworks, if a clockwork spy is caught in the act of recording its target, escape is usually the most practical course of action for it.

  Clockwork spies are about 2 feet wide from leg to leg, and weigh less than 40 pounds.
