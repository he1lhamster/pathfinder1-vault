special_abilities:
  Close Ranks (Ex): A hobgoblin phalanx troop can adopt a defensive position as a
    move action. This doubles the troop's shield bonus to AC and grants it DR 5/-
    until the beginning of its next turn. While adopting this defensive posture, the
    hobgoblin phalanx troop's speed is reduced to 5 feet.
  Tripping Spears (Ex): Hobgoblin phalanx troops are adept at using their spears to
    knock creatures off their feet. The troop's troop attack gains the trip weapon
    quality.
  Volley (Ex): A hobgoblin phalanx troop can fire a volley of arrows as a standard
    action. This attack takes the form of up to four lines with a range of 100 feet.
    These lines can start from the corner of any square in the troop's space. Each
    creature in any of these lines takes 4d6 points of piercing damage per line that
    hits it (Reflex DC 20 half). The save DC is Dexterity-based.
desc_long: Hobgoblin soldiers who excel in Ironfang Legion regiments are promoted
  to serve in the Ironfang Phalanx. These soldiers are in much better physical condition
  than typical Ironfang Legion soldiers and are trained in specialized shield and
  spear techniques, allowing them to erect a nearly impenetrable shield wall while
  still keeping their spears up and ready to strike.
