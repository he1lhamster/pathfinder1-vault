### Special Abilities

**_Burning_ Wings (Su)** A creature damaged by Ragathiel’s _burning_ wings must succeed at a DC 39 Reflex save or catch fire. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Devils’ End (Ex)** Ragathiel gains a +4 bonus on caster level checks against devils and on saving throws against their spells, as well as to the DCs of his own supernatural abilities and _spell-like abilities_ against devils. Against his father, Dispater, this bonus increases to +8.

**Golden Armor (Ex)** Ragathiel is never hindered by his +5 _full plate_, and is considered to be not wearing armor for the purposes of his maximum Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, his armor check penalty, and his speed.

**Lay on Hands (Su)** Ragathiel’s lay on hands works as a _[[classes/Paladin|paladin]]_’s. He can apply any _paladin_ mercy to his lay on hands ability, and he can use this ability on himself even when a condition or effect would otherwise deny him actions on his turn.

**Primal Aura (Su)** As a free action with Ragathiel’s permission, any ally within Ragathiel’s primal aura can spend two uses of Ragathiel’s smite evil (or four uses of lay on hands) to instantly grant each ally within the aura the benefits of Ragathiel’s smite evil against an enemy of that ally’s choice.

**_Righteous_ Mantle (Ex)** Ragathiel inherited an affinity for fire from his mother. Fire heals Ragathiel a number of hit points equal to the amount of damage it would have dealt. Any fire damage dealt by Ragathiel ignores evil outsiders’ fire _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ and _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to fire, and deals double damage to devils. Ragathiel gains a _sacred_ bonus to Armor Class equal to his Charisma bonus. Whenever Ragathiel receives magical healing, he has 2 additional hit points restored per die rolled.
**Smite Evil (Su)** Ragathiel can smite evil as a 20th-level _paladin_, but his smite deals extra damage only on the first hit against evil outsiders (not evil dragons or undead). He can trade two uses of lay on hands for an additional use of smite evil as many times per day as he wishes, provided he has enough uses of lay on hands available to do so.

##### Description

Ragathiel is the son of the archdevil Dispater (see page 22) and a demigoddess of flame. He rejected his father’s evil, losing his sixth wing to the archdevil’s wrath, and escaped to Heaven, where he spent several millennia attempting to prove himself to the heavenly hosts and the other empyreal lords. Though many empyreal lords still find him far more _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Bloodthirsty|bloodthirsty]]_ than they would prefer, the many centuries have proven Ragathiel’s honor, loyalty, and _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Determination|determination]]_ time and again, and the other empyreal lords have come to trust his word completely.

Now Ragathiel leads the war against Hell as the General of _[[feats/Vengeance|Vengeance]]_. He is not content to plan from the sidelines and allow his forces to succeed or fail on the strength of his strategies alone. Instead, he leads by example from the forefront of his army, a shining figure of golden flame daring any foe to confront him and hewing through the ranks of devils to create a vulnerable area in the otherwise perfect infernal formation where his own armies then strike. Thus far, his strategy has served him well, as the archdevils prefer self-preservation to risking themselves in a direct confrontation with the General of _Vengeance_—but it won’t take too many more successful forays before Barbatos (see page 18) moves to take decisive action, possibly bolstered by the forces of Ragathiel’s father, Dispater.

Ragathiel’s domain is a magnificent, towering fortress of steel and silver that stands upon the lower slopes of Heaven. The domain is simply named Ragathiel’s Fortress, as the General of _Vengeance_ has no use for a fancier appellation. There is beauty to be found in the fortress’s design, but it is the sort of beauty and elegance of design and functionality that would be lauded by engineers and military tacticians, rather than artists and poets; Ragathiel specifically built his fortress to withstand a thousand-year siege and prevent ingress into Heaven for that entire duration, even by hosts of enemies that, like most evil outsiders, have access to teleportation magic.
