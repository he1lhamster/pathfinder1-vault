# Vrykolakas
This twisted, barely-humanoid monstrosity has rancid-looking

flesh, an unnaturally long neck, and a mouth full of fangs.

### Special Abilities

**Create Spawn (Su)** A humanoid slain by a _[[monsters/Vrykolakas|vrykolakas]]_ becomes a free-willed _vrykolakas_ itself in 1d4 days if not _[[feats/Blessed|blessed]]_ and given proper funerary rites. A blessing might entail either the spell _[[spells/Bless|bless]]_ or a more mundane consecration, but at the very least requires a proper _[[spells/Prayer|prayer]]_ (with a successful DC 15 Knowledge [religion] check) invoking a good-aligned deity.

**Feral _Possession_ (Su)** Upon being reduced to 0 hit points, a _vrykolakas_ attempts to possess any animal within 100 feet. This ability is similar to _possession_ and has a duration equal to 1 day for every Hit Die the _vrykolakas_ has. The target must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be possessed. If the _possession_ fails, the _vrykolakas_ immediately dies. If the _possession_ succeeds, the animal immediately retreats to the _vrykolakas_’s lair, where it attempts to bury itself in the earth. If left uninterrupted for 1d4 days, the animal transforms into a new _vrykolakas_ with all the same statistics as the original. If discovered and slain during this time, both the animal and the _vrykolakas_ are destroyed. If discovered and the _possession_ effect is ended via _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ or a similar effect, the animal returns to normal and the _vrykolakas_ is destroyed (caster level is equal to the _vrykolakas_’s CR for the purposes of resolving this _dispel magic_ attempt). The save DC is Charisma-based.

**_Pestilent_ Aura (Su)** Creatures within 5 feet of a _vrykolakas_ must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or contract _[[diseases/Bubonic Plague|bubonic plague]]_. Any creature that successfully saves against a _vrykolakas_’s _pestilent_ aura cannot be affected by the aura of that same _vrykolakas_ for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

_Bubonic Plague_: save Fort DC 21; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con damage and 1 Cha damage and target is _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_; cure 2 consecutive saves.

##### Description

The _vrykolakas_ knows only _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ and relishes the suffering of those who failed it in life. Reanimated corpses of wicked and vengeful souls denied even the most basic burial rites, these unreasoning, vampire-like creatures unleash their wrath against the living indiscriminately, spreading disease and death among all in their paths.
