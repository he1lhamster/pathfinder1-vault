  Savage Bite (Ex): An akhlut's bite threatens a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.
  Shore Storming (Ex): An akhlut automatically transforms into an orca whenever it
    is fully immersed in water, losing its legs and fur. Likewise, when an akhlut
    emerges from the water, it automatically transforms into its wolf-orca hybrid
    form. If an akhlut moves from water to land (or vice versa) on the round before
    initiating combat, it gains a +8 bonus on its initiative check. This initial attack
    resolves as a charge. An akhlut has the same statistics in both forms.
  Snow Vision (Ex): An akhlut can see perfectly well in snowy conditions, and does
    not take any penalties on Perception checks while in snowy weather.
  Snow Walking (Su): An akhlut can walk on snow or thin sheets of ice as though affected
    by water walk. It only leaves a trail on such surfaces when it wants to.
desc_long: |-
  Resembling nothing so much as a killer whale mixed with a wolf, the rarely seen akhlut stalks frigid seas and the frozen lands nearby, shrouded by perpetual blizzards. Legend holds that the first akhlut was born fully-formed in the eye of a polar hurricane, the merciless anger of the elements made flesh. Whether or not the tale is true, the akhlut's ferocity is certainly as memorable as that of any storm.

  While the akhlut appears as a wolf-orca hybrid on land, when it enters the water, its legs and fur vanish and it transforms fully into the form of an orca. Akhluts are particularly skilled at charging into and out of water, their transformation between shapes occurring in the blink of an eye.

  Each akhlut fiercely defends its hunting grounds from other predators, and especially against other akhluts. While this does reduce the number of dangerous predators in a region, it's unclear whether replacing lesser predators with something as dangerous as an akhlut is actually preferable. Typically, an akhlut considers its territory to be the boundaries of the storm created by its control weather spell-like ability, and rarely travels far from this storm's borders.

  An akhlut is 22 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds.

##### Description

Resembling nothing so much as a killer _[[monsters/Whale|whale]]_ mixed with a _[[monsters/Wolf|wolf]]_, the rarely seen _akhlut_ stalks frigid seas and the frozen lands nearby, shrouded by perpetual blizzards. Legend holds that the first _akhlut_ was born fully-formed in the eye of a polar hurricane, the merciless anger of the elements made flesh. Whether or not the tale is true, the _akhlut_’s _[[universal monster rules/Ferocity|ferocity]]_ is certainly as memorable as that of any storm.

While the _akhlut_ appears as a wolf-orca hybrid on land, when it enters the water, its legs and fur _[[spells/Vanish|vanish]]_ and it transforms fully into the form of an orca. Akhluts are particularly skilled at charging into and out of water, their _[[spells/Transformation|transformation]]_ between shapes occurring in the _[[spells/Blink|blink]]_ of an eye.

Each _akhlut_ fiercely defends its hunting grounds from other predators, and especially against other akhluts. While this does reduce the number of dangerous predators in a region, it’s unclear whether replacing lesser predators with something as dangerous as an _akhlut_ is actually preferable. Typically, an _akhlut_ considers its territory to be the boundaries of the storm created by its _control weather_ spell-like ability, and rarely travels far from this storm’s borders.

An _akhlut_ is 22 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds.
