  Baleful Shriek (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds, a revenant can shriek as a standard
    action. All creatures within a 60-foot spread must make a DC 18 Will save or cower
    in fear for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Reason to Hate (Su): A revenant's existence is fueled by its hatred for its murderer.
    As long as the murderer exists, the revenant exists. If the murderer dies, the
    revenant is immediately slain. A murderer who becomes undead does not trigger
    a revenant's destruction. When a revenant encounters its murderer, it gains the
    benefits of a haste spell (CL 20th) that lasts as long as its murderer remains
    in sight. Against its murderer, the revenant also gains a +4 profane bonus on
    attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, grapple checks, and saving throws.
  Self-Loathing (Ex): When confronted with its reflection or any object that was important
    to it in life, a revenant must make a DC 20 Will save to avoid becoming overwhelmed
    with self-pity. This condition renders the revenant helpless, and lasts until
    the revenant is attacked or sees its murderer. If a revenant resists becoming
    overwhelmed, the revenant becomes obsessed with the source that triggered the
    saving throw and does everything it can to destroy it, reacting to the trigger
    as if the trigger were its murderer and gaining bonuses from its reason to hate
    ability.
  Sense Murderer (Su): A revenant knows the direction but not the distance to its
    murderer-this sense can be blocked by any effect that blocks scrying. Against
    its murderer, a revenant has true seeing and discern lies in effect at all times
    (CL 20th); these abilities cannot be dispelled.
desc_long: Fueled by hatred and a need for vengeance, a revenant rises from the grave
  to hunt and kill its murderer. Devoid of any compassion, emotion, or logic, a revenant
  has but one purpose, and cannot rest until it has found vengeance.

### Special Abilities

**Baleful Shriek (Su)** Once every 1d4 rounds, a _[[monsters/Revenant|revenant]]_ can shriek as a standard action. All creatures within a 60-foot spread must make a DC 18 Will save or cower in _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting _fear_ effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Reason to Hate (Su)** A _revenant_’s existence is fueled by its hatred for its murderer. As long as the murderer exists, the _revenant_ exists. If the murderer dies, the _revenant_ is immediately slain. A murderer who becomes undead does not trigger a _revenant_’s _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_. When a _revenant_ encounters its murderer, it gains the benefits of a _[[spells/Haste|haste]]_ spell (CL 20th) that lasts as long as its murderer remains in sight. Against its murderer, the _revenant_ also gains a +4 profane bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, grapple checks, and saving throws.
**Self-Loathing (Ex)** When confronted with its reflection or any object that was important to it in life, a _revenant_ must make a DC 20 Will save to avoid becoming overwhelmed with self-pity. This condition renders the _revenant_ _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_, and lasts until the _revenant_ is attacked or sees its murderer. If a _revenant_ resists becoming overwhelmed, the _revenant_ becomes obsessed with the source that triggered the saving throw and does everything it can to destroy it, reacting to the trigger as if the trigger were its murderer and gaining bonuses from its reason to hate ability.
**Sense Murderer (Su)** A _revenant_ knows the direction but not the distance to its murderer—this sense can be blocked by any effect that blocks _[[spells/Scrying|scrying]]_. Against its murderer, a _revenant_ has _[[spells/True Seeing|true seeing]]_ and _[[spells/Discern Lies|discern lies]]_ in effect at all times (CL 20th); these abilities cannot be dispelled.

##### Description

Fueled by hatred and a need for _[[feats/Vengeance|vengeance]]_, a _revenant_ rises from the grave to hunt and kill its murderer. Devoid of any compassion, emotion, or logic, a _revenant_ has but one purpose, and cannot rest until it has found _vengeance_.
