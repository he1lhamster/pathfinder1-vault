special_abilities:
  Axiomatic Barrage (Su): As a standard action, a hammer archon can slam the head
    of his hammer against the ground, creating an ordered pulse of energy in a 30-foot-radius
    burst. Only chaotic and neutral (nonlawful) creatures are harmed by this energy,
    which deals 10d6 points of damage to chaotic creatures (or 10d8 points of damage
    to outsiders with the chaotic subtype) and slows them for 1d6 rounds (as per slow).
    A successful DC 26 Will saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the
    slow effect. This ability deals only half damage to creatures that are neither
    chaotic nor lawful, and they are not slowed. Such a creature can reduce the damage
    by half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful DC 26 Will saving throw.
    A hammer archon can use this ability once every 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Immovable Object (Su): When not in the archon's possession, a hammer archon's lucerne
    hammer can be picked up or moved by only another hammer archon or a lawful outsider
    of at least the same CR as the hammer archon. A hammer archon's lucerne hammer
    has double the hardness and 50% more hit points than a normal lucerne hammer.
    This quality persists for 24 hours after the hammer archon's death.
  Inevitable Sunder (Ex): When a hammer archon attempts a sunder combat maneuver against
    an item held or wielded by a chaotic- or evil-aligned creature (or a creature
    with the chaotic or evil subtype), the hammer archon ignores the target item's
    hardness.
  Reverberation (Ex): A hammer archon's body is harmonically attuned to provide it
    with extraordinary defenses. The archon is immune to bludgeoning damage. Additionally,
    whenever a character strikes a hammer archon with a weapon (magical or nonmagical),
    the weapon takes 3d6 points of damage. Apply the weapon's hardness normally. Weapons
    that take any amount of damage in excess of their hardness gain the broken quality.
desc_long: |-
  Hammer archons are the unstoppable champions of celestial armies, called to fight against paragons of evil and chaos when all hope seems otherwise lost. Their powerful hammers sweep through lesser enemies and shatter shields and weapons with ease. Each hammer archon's plate armor gleams like polished silver and resists even the strongest blows from hammers and other bludgeoning weapons.

   A hammer archon stands 10 feet tall and weighs approximately 900 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**_Axiomatic_ Barrage (Su)** As a standard action, a _[[items/Mundane/Hammer|hammer]]_ archon can slam the head of his _hammer_ against the ground, creating an ordered pulse of energy in a 30-foot-radius burst. Only chaotic and neutral (nonlawful) creatures are harmed by this energy, which deals 10d6 points of damage to chaotic creatures (or 10d8 points of damage to outsiders with the chaotic subtype) and slows them for 1d6 rounds (as per _[[spells/Slow|slow]]_). A successful DC 26 Will saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the _slow_ effect. This ability deals only half damage to creatures that are neither chaotic nor lawful, and they are not slowed. Such a creature can reduce the damage by half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful DC 26 Will saving throw. A _hammer_ archon can use this ability once every 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Immovable Object (Su)** When not in the archon’s _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_, a _hammer_ archon’s _lucerne hammer_ can be picked up or moved by only another _hammer_ archon or a lawful outsider of at least the same CR as the _hammer_ archon. A _hammer_ archon’s _lucerne hammer_ has double the hardness and 50% more hit points than a normal _lucerne hammer_. This quality persists for 24 hours after the _hammer_ archon’s death.

**Inevitable Sunder (Ex)** When a _hammer_ archon attempts a sunder combat maneuver against an item held or wielded by a chaotic- or evil-aligned creature (or a creature with the chaotic or evil subtype), the _hammer_ archon ignores the target item’s hardness.

**Reverberation (Ex)** A _hammer_ archon’s body is harmonically attuned to provide it with extraordinary defenses. The archon is immune to bludgeoning damage. Additionally, whenever a character strikes a _hammer_ archon with a weapon (magical or nonmagical), the weapon takes 3d6 points of damage. Apply the weapon’s hardness normally. Weapons that take any amount of damage in excess of their hardness gain the _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ quality.

##### Description

_Hammer_ archons are the unstoppable champions of celestial armies, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ to fight against paragons of evil and chaos when all hope seems otherwise lost. Their powerful hammers sweep through lesser enemies and _[[spells/Shatter|shatter]]_ shields and weapons with ease. Each _hammer_ archon’s plate armor gleams like polished silver and resists even the strongest blows from hammers and other bludgeoning weapons.

A _hammer_ archon stands 10 feet tall and weighs approximately 900 pounds.
