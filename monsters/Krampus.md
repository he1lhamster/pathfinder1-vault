### Special Abilities

**Capture (Su)** If _[[monsters/Krampus|Krampus]]_ begins its turn grappling a _[[classes/Medium|Medium]]_ or smaller creature, it can stuff the target into its bag as a swift action that doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity. A creature stuffed into this bag is subjected to _Krampus_’s regression ability (see below). A creature in the bag can try to cut its way free with any light slashing weapon. The bag has AC 25, hardness 20, and 30 hit points. If a creature cuts its way out of the bag, _Krampus_ can repair the bag as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Until then, any creature stuffed into the bag is still subjected to the regression ability but can escape with a move action that provokes an attack of opportunity from _Krampus_. The bag has other special qualities while in _Krampus_’s _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_. The weight of creatures in the bag doesn’t count against _Krampus_’s carrying capacity. Up to four Small creatures or two _Medium_ creatures can fit in the bag at a time. If used by any creature other than _Krampus_, the container functions as a mundane _[[items/Mundane/Sack|sack]]_. If _Krampus_’s bag is lost or destroyed, it can create a new bag with 1 hour of work.

**Limited Immortality (Su)** Though _Krampus_ still needs to eat, drink, and sleep, it doesn’t age and can’t die of old age. If _Krampus_ is killed, a new _Krampus_ forms elsewhere in the world after a year’s time—this new _Krampus_ retains the memories of the previous _Krampus_ and likely holds a grudge against the person who killed it the year before. If a method to disrupt this cycle exists, it has yet to be discovered by mortals.

**Mystical Chains (Su)** _Krampus_’s chains function as a +3 _spiked chain_ and also count as an evil weapon for the purpose of overcoming _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_. These chains become non-magical if _Krampus_ does not carry or wield them, and if a chain is disarmed or destroyed, _Krampus_ can create a new set of chains as a standard action. The chains react almost as a living extension of _Krampus_’s will and have the _grab_ ability.

**Punish the Naughty (Su)** As a swift action, _Krampus_ can designate a single target it can see as being “naughty.” The target must be a child, a creature with the young template, or a victim of _Krampus_’s regression ability. Against that target, _Krampus_ gains a +5 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls and Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks. These bonuses remain in effect until the target is dead or _Krampus_ designates another target as naughty.

**Regression (Su)** Each round a creature begins its turn stuffed into _Krampus_’s bag, it must succeed at a DC 32 Fortitude saving throw or be regressed back to its childhood. The creature is affected in size as if via _[[spells/Reduce Person|reduce person]]_, but none of the target’s gear changes size. This effect persists for 24 hours, after which the target regains its original size. A creature currently under the effects of regression cannot be further affected by this ability. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
**Snowstep (Su)** _Krampus_ is constantly under the effects of a _[[spells/Pass without Trace|pass without trace]]_ spell, but only in snowy environments.
**_[[spells/Storm Sight|Storm Sight]]_ (Ex)** _Krampus_ can see perfectly well in stormy conditions, including in blizzards; it does not take any penalties on Perception checks while in snow.

##### Description

In frigid northern climes, celebrations and festivals are important to maintain a community’s morale, especially in the winter months when food is scarce and the days are short. Many of these holidays involve lighting cheery fires, forgiving grudges, decorating trees, and exchanging gifts. Unfortunately, in some areas, these times of merriment are tarnished by the looming specter of _Krampus_, a terrifying creature that hunts those it considers to be acting against the spirit of the times. However, thanks to _Krampus_’s twisted morality, it sees selfishness and incivility everywhere it goes.

_Krampus_ is a tall, goatlike humanoid with large horns and a long tongue that constantly lolls out of one side of its mouth or the other. Though its _[[universal monster rules/Natural Attacks|natural attacks]]_ are powerful enough to break bones, _Krampus_ also carries a set of iron chains that it uses to thrash and grapple its foes. The oversized bag it carries is often stained with the blood of its captured victims. _Krampus_ stands 14 feet tall and weighs 1,000 pounds.

The origins of _Krampus_ are _[[feats/Shrouded In Mystery|shrouded in mystery]]_, with stories of the creature _[[spells/Seeming|seeming]]_ to stretch back hundreds or even thousands of years, if not more. To the beleaguered regions under _Krampus_’s tyranny, the creature has simply always been around.

The most popular legend regarding _Krampus_’s beginnings starts with a handful of mountain towns under the protection of a circle of druids. After several harsh winters that the townsfolk almost didn’t survive, they came to doubt the rituals that the druids believed appeased the local nature spirits. As the villagers grew more and more resentful, the druids took drastic action. They attempted to create a central figure for the important winter rituals that would make people want to celebrate them. Under the light of a blue moon, one of the druids opened an imperfect portal to the primal realm of the fey and brought forth the essence of a spirit of revenge, and a new creature was born—_Krampus_.

For a while, _Krampus_ was everything the druids wanted. It brought together the villagers in revelry during the day and left small gifts of fruit for them in the night. However, _[[monsters/Unknown|unknown]]_ to the druids, the portal had been corrupted by the villagers’ hateful emotions and _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Bitter|bitter]]_ resentment, which began to stain the creature’s soul. _Krampus_ began punishing those who behaved selfishly during these lean times, first simply striking them with bundles of birch, but then escalating to using magic to transform them into the petulant children it _[[items/Mundane/Saw|saw]]_ them as. Eventually, it came to see everyone as wicked and terrorized the villages for weeks.

The remainder of the druidic circle managed to locate the creature as it slept and shackled it in cold iron chains, believing it still retained a part of its fey nature. They were wrong. When _Krampus_ awoke, the creature tore free from its restraints and used those same chains to beat the druids to death. It then retreated into the snow-blanketed forest for the remainder of the season.

_Krampus_ returned year after year, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Growing|growing]]_ stronger and more hideous with each winter solstice and gaining a taste for humanoid flesh. Even its periodic “death” at the hands of heroes did nothing to stop this cycle. Fortunately, while it could ravage the countryside all year long, for some reason it chooses to limit its predations to the winter months. Where it goes the rest of the year, no one has been able to discover.
