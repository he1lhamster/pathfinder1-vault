# Manasaputra, Manu
A toned, regal human radiates a shifting aura of many colors and

### Special Abilities

**Aura of Unity (Su)** All allies that belong to the manu’s

creature bond work toward a unified goal while

within 30 feet of the manu. As an immediate action,

the manu can attempt an attack roll, saving throw,

or skill check to replace the roll just made by an ally

benefitting from the manu’s aura of unity.

**Creature Bond (Ex)** Each manu is associated with a

single race or kind of creature, such as humans or

basilisks (not humanoids or magical beasts); this bond never

changes. The manu is treated as both a manasaputra and as

the race, creature type, and subtypes of its bonded creature

for the purposes of effects that target a specific race or kind

of creature.

##### Description

Manus aspire to elevate members of a specific race or type

of creature to enlightenment, adopting them collectively

as special charges. Typically, this race or type of creature

is chosen from those to whom the manu belonged during

its most meaningful mortal incarnation, but this is not

always the case.

While most manus focus on a people’s enlightenment

across a single Material Plane world, some ambitious

manus follow their charges from world to world,

continuing to elevate and guide them as they propagate

among the stars. Manus are largely solitary, though they

sometimes gather into tight-knit groups _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_

rounds that coordinate efforts to guide their

chosen peoples.
