##### Description

Sometimes a pregnant _[[monsters/Death Worm|death worm]]_ lays an especially promising egg among her brood, about twice as large as the others and with a nigh-impenetrable, brownspeckled shell. This egg requires even more warmth than the others in its clutch, and upon emerging the worm would rather devour its brethren than the meal left by its parent. Such rare specimens grow up to become _death worm_ leviathans, and those few who have heard of the fell beasts know to _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ them as well as to hold them in awe. _Death worm_ leviathans possess powers nearly identical to those of their smaller kin, albeit at a much deadlier scale. In addition, their massive girth makes it even easier for them to consume prey both large and small, and a single _[[monsters/Leviathan|leviathan]]_ might consume an entire desert village before its terrible hunger is sated.
