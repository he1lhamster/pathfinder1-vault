  Dance of Death (Su): A danse macabre is constantly surrounded by a 40-foot aura
    known as the dance of death, an endless gala of dancing spectral figures. Any
    living creature that enters the area of the dance of death must attempt a DC 27
    Will save. On a failed save, the victim joins the ghostly dancers, takes 1d4 points
    of Constitution drain, and is affected as per irresistible dance (CL 14th). A
    creature can attempt a new DC 27 Will save at the end of its turn to escape from
    the effects of a dance of death; otherwise, these effects persist for as long
    as the victim remains within the aura. The Constitution drain effect only occurs,
    however, after the initial failed saving throw. As victims cannot willingly move
    from the square in which they dance, the dance's effects end when the danse macabre
    moves to a point where the victim is no longer within its aura, the danse macabre
    is destroyed, or if the victim is physically removed from the area. A victim who
    succeeds at a save (whether from the original exposure or at a later point to
    successfully escape the effect) is immune to the dance of death of the same danse
    macabre for 24 hours. Dance of death is a visual, sonic, mind-affecting compulsion
    effect, and blindness or deafness can provide protection from the effect. The
    save DC is Charisma-based.
  Deathless (Su): As a manifestation of death incarnate, a danse macabre is not itself
    subject to permanent destruction. If reduced to 0 hit points, it vanishes, only
    to rejuvenate at full hit points in 1d4 days. Only by destroying the creature
    and then casting hallow to consecrate the site it manifested upon prevents the
    undead monster's reappearance.
  Incorporeal Scythe (Su): A danse macabre wields an incorporeal scythe in combat
    that leaves deep and horrific wounds on any creature it strikes. Attacks made
    with this scythe are touch attacks and deal slashing damage, but are not modified
    by any of the monster's ability scores. A creature hit by a danse macabre's incorporeal
    scythe attack must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution
    drain. Each time a danse macabre drains Constitution from a target, the danse
    macabre regains 5 hit points, regardless of the total number of Constitution points
    drained by the attack. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Lifesense (Su): A danse macabre notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet,
    just as if it had the blindsight ability. It also senses the strength of life
    forces automatically, as per deathwatch.
desc_long: |-
  Danse macabres are the embodiment of the inevitability of death. They represent the ultimate equalizer of station, revealing in their dance of death the futility of all life. It has been said that, in the end, all mortal beings must face the fateful piper and dance to its tune. If such claims are true, then surely the danse macabre is the personification of such a dreadful doom.

   Danse macabres typically manifest as looming, black-cloaked skeletons, although they may appear in other sinister forms depending on personifications of death unique to the cultures near where they manifest, such as a fiery pillar, a pale child, or a man in a white mask. The crowd of dancing souls that surround these 10-foot-tall specters typically do little to dispel their ominous aura. While these ghostly images are entirely insubstantial and harmless, they also emanate faint, haunting music, as if a violin-led orchestra is playing along. When a victim succumbs to the creature's dance of death, the music becomes nearly deafening and the spectral figures appear almost real. The dancers and music cannot be interacted with, but visibly and audibly mark the boundaries of the danse macabre's dance of death aura.

### Special Abilities

**Dance of Death (Su)** A _[[monsters/Danse Macabre|danse macabre]]_ is constantly surrounded by a 40-foot aura known as the dance of death, an endless gala of _dancing_ spectral figures. Any living creature that enters the area of the dance of death must attempt a DC 27 Will save. On a failed save, the victim joins the ghostly dancers, takes 1d4 points of Constitution drain, and is affected as per _[[spells/Irresistible Dance|irresistible dance]]_ (CL 14th). A creature can attempt a new DC 27 Will save at the end of its turn to escape from the effects of a dance of death; otherwise, these effects persist for as long as the victim remains within the aura. The Constitution drain effect only occurs, however, after the initial failed saving throw. As victims cannot willingly move from the square in which they dance, the dance’s effects end when the _danse macabre_ moves to a point where the victim is no longer within its aura, the _danse macabre_ is destroyed, or if the victim is physically removed from the area. A victim who succeeds at a save (whether from the original exposure or at a later point to successfully escape the effect) is immune to the dance of death of the same _danse macabre_ for 24 hours. Dance of death is a visual, sonic, mind-affecting compulsion effect, and blindness or deafness can provide protection from the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**_Deathless_ (Su)** As a manifestation of death incarnate, a _danse macabre_ is not itself subject to permanent _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_. If reduced to 0 hit points, it vanishes, only to rejuvenate at full hit points in 1d4 days. Only by destroying the creature and then casting _[[spells/Hallow|hallow]]_ to _[[spells/Consecrate|consecrate]]_ the site it manifested upon prevents the undead monster’s reappearance.

**_Incorporeal_ _Scythe_ (Su)** A _danse macabre_ wields an _incorporeal_ _scythe_ in combat that leaves deep and horrific wounds on any creature it strikes. Attacks made with this _scythe_ are touch attacks and deal slashing damage, but are not modified by any of the monster’s ability scores. A creature hit by a _danse macabre_’s _incorporeal_ _scythe_ attack must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution drain. Each time a _danse macabre_ drains Constitution from a target, the _danse macabre_ regains 5 hit points, regardless of the total number of Constitution points drained by the attack. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**_Lifesense_ (Su)** A _danse macabre_ notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it had the _[[universal monster rules/Blindsight|blindsight]]_ ability. It also senses the strength of life forces automatically, as per _[[spells/Deathwatch|deathwatch]]_.

##### Description

Danse macabres are the embodiment of the inevitability of death. They represent the ultimate equalizer of station, revealing in their dance of death the futility of all life. It has been said that, in the end, all mortal beings must face the fateful piper and dance to its tune. If such claims are true, then surely the _danse macabre_ is the personification of such a dreadful _[[spells/Doom|doom]]_.

Danse macabres typically manifest as looming, black-cloaked skeletons, although they may appear in other sinister forms depending on personifications of death unique to the cultures near where they manifest, such as a fiery pillar, a pale child, or a man in a white _[[items/Mundane/Mask|mask]]_. The crowd of _dancing_ souls that surround these 10-foot-tall specters typically do little to dispel their _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Ominous|ominous]]_ aura. While these ghostly images are entirely insubstantial and harmless, they also emanate faint, haunting music, as if a violin-led orchestra is playing along. When a victim succumbs to the creature’s dance of death, the music becomes nearly deafening and the spectral figures appear almost real. The dancers and music cannot be interacted with, but visibly and audibly mark the boundaries of the _danse macabre_’s dance of death aura.
