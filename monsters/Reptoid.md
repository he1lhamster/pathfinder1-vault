### Special Abilities

**_Change Shape_ (Su)** A

_reptoid_ can assume

the appearance of a specific

single _Medium_ humanoid. The _reptoid_

always takes this specific form when it uses

this ability. The _reptoid_ gains a +10 racial

bonus on Disguise checks to appear as that

type of humanoid. This ability otherwise

functions as _[[spells/Alter Self|alter self]]_, except the _reptoid_

does not adjust its ability scores. A _reptoid_ can

select a new humanoid form by spending 1 week

preparing itself for the change, but can then no

longer assume its previous humanoid form.

**Mental Potency (Ex)** A _reptoid_’s mental effects

can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of

creatures than normal. Both the Hit Die limit and the total

number of Hit Dice affected by each enchantment or illusion

spell it casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells

it casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the

number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell

that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a

spell that targets only one creature would not be). This ability

stacks with the _mesmerist_’s ability of the same name.

##### Description

Reptoids are bipedal reptiles from another planet, or

perhaps even another plane—they refuse to reveal their

origins to humanoids, even under duress. Disguised as

members of others races, the reptoids seek positions of

power in order to secretly prepare for an invasion from

their homeworld. Even those who are aware of reptoids in

their midst can never be truly sure who is real and who is

an alien, as these creatures are often adept at enchantment

and _[[universal monster rules/Psychic Magic|psychic magic]]_, which they use to cover the tracks of

their deceptions and to ensure the complacency or even

collusion of their soon-to-be thralls.
