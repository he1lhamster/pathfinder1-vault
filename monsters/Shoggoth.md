  All-Around Vision (Ex): A shoggoth's many sense organs grant a +4 racial bonus on

  Maddening Cacophony (Su): As a free action, a shoggoth can give voice to sounds
    and words sane life was not meant to hear. All creatures in a 60-foot radius must
    make a DC 22 Will save or be confused for 1d6 rounds. Each round a creature is
    affected it takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage. A creature that saves cannot be
    affected by this shoggoth's maddening cacophony for 24 hours. This is a sonic
    mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Engulf (Ex): To use this ability, the shoggoth must begin its turn grappling a creature
    or must trample. A shoggoth may attempt to engulf as many creatures as it grapples
    or tramples in a round. This ability otherwise functions as swallow whole, save
    that a creature that cut its way out of a shoggoth leaves no hole in the protoplasmic
    creature's body.
desc_long: |-
  Although even lunatics and doom-saying prophets desperately claim the monstrous shoggoth is nothing more than a drug-induced vision or thankfully unreal nightmare, the truth is altogether more dire. The shoggoths exist, although they keep to the deepest of ocean trenches or the most remote of forgotten caverns and ruins, emerging only rarely to spread madness and destruction in their slime-caked wakes.

  The first shoggoths were created in eons past, long before the first gods turned their attentions to the Material Plane. Some hold that the aboleths engineered them, while certain strange texts hint of a race even older that engineered the first shoggoths as slaves. Eventually, these dread beasts developed enough intelligence to rebel against their creators, and now they lurk, patient but potent, in the lightless deep.

##### Description

Although even lunatics and doom-saying prophets desperately claim the monstrous _shoggoth_ is nothing more than a drug-induced _[[spells/Vision|vision]]_ or thankfully unreal _[[spells/Nightmare|nightmare]]_, the truth is altogether more dire. The shoggoths exist, although they keep to the deepest of ocean trenches or the most remote of forgotten caverns and ruins, emerging only rarely to spread madness and _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ in their slime-caked wakes.

The first shoggoths were created in eons past, long before the first gods turned their attentions to the Material Plane. Some hold that the aboleths engineered them, while certain strange texts hint of a race even older that engineered the first shoggoths as slaves. Eventually, these dread beasts developed enough intelligence to rebel against their creators, and now they lurk, patient but _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_, in the lightless deep.
