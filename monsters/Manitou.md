  Positive Energy Aura (Su): Living creatures within the manitou's aura heal 5 hit
    points on its turn each round. A manitou can exclude a number of creatures equal
    to its Charisma modifier (typically 7) from the aura's effect, and can cease or
    resume the aura as a free action.
  Spirit Stampede (Su): Every 1d4 rounds, a manitou can call upon animal spirits to
    attack, affecting a 60-foot cone and dealing 10d6 points of force damage (Reflex
    DC 26 half). Using this ability temporarily weakens the manitou's connection with
    the natural world, halting its positive energy aura until the stampede is ready
    to be used again.
  Token of Fortune (Su): A manitou can imbue an small object, such as a stone or necklace,
    with its blessing. The object's bearer and any allies within 10 feet gain a +2
    luck bonus on saving throws. The manitou can use scrying on the token at will.
    The manitou can teleport to it (without error) once per day as a swift action.
    These abilities are lost if the token leaves the manitou's territory. A manitou
    may only have one token active at a time.
desc_long: A manitou is a powerful, benevolent spirit of nature that safeguards entire
  regions from danger, heals the sick and wounded, and preserves the balance among
  all creatures. When not invisible, a manitou looks like a powerfully built, long-haired
  humanoid with skin made of tree bark and rose quartz. A manitou stands 20 feet tall
  and weighs over 5,000 pounds.
