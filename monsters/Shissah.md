  Desert Dweller (Ex): A shissah feels at home in the desert and does not treat light
    rubble or sand as difficult terrain. It gains a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks
    in the desert, and it treats hot temperatures as one category less for the purposes
    of heat danger. Thus, a shissah does not suffer unduly in very hot conditions,
    treating severe heat as very hot and extreme heat as severe heat.
  Desert Senses (Ex): A shissah is familiar with mirages and gains a +4 racial bonus
    on saving throws against mirage effects and against effects that cause the dazzled
    condition. It gains a +4 racial bonus on Perception checks in deserts.
  Easily Trained (Ex): A shissah is unusually quick to pick up tricks and animal training.
    Anyone attempting to train a shissah gains a +2 bonus on her Handle Animal checks.
    A shissah can learn an additional 2 tricks beyond what an animal of its intelligence
    can normally be taught.
desc_long: |-
  Shissahs are smaller and seem more delicate than most horses, but their fragile appearance belies their hardiness. They can travel for weeks on minimal water rations and survive on desert scrub and even locusts if necessary. Their large, wide-set eyes, which are surrounded by a thin ring of black, hairless skin, enable them to see despite the glare of the desert sun. Their wide foreheads, tapering to a slender muzzle, indicate their great intelligence. Their high-arched tails are often taken as a sign of their fiery spirit.

   Shissahs come in a wide range of colors, and they are often used to refine the lines of other breeds and lend them greater intelligence and bravery. Few leave the hands of Keleshite owners, for a shissah is no mere mount, but a fierce and loyal partner.
