##### Description

The woolly _rhinoceros_ is an herbivore, though unlike its non-woolly cousin it grazes for food rather than browsing on larger plants. The woolly rhino is legendary for its foul temper, and its size and huge horn give it a ferocious bravery. Any threat (real or perceived) to the rhino or its herd is met with loud _[[items/Mundane/Bellows|bellows]]_ and the stomping of feet. Often, those who unwittingly anger a woolly rhino have no time to amend the intrusion before the beast attacks.
