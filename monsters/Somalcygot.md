##### Description

Somalcygots are incredibly territorial; each claims roughly

a mile-radius patch of desolate surface on a moon, asteroid,

or similar airless terrestrial environment as its chosen

hunting ground, and enters another’s territory only to

mate. Somalcygots can digest nearly any organic matter,

but because they usually live on barren terrain, they often

go for long intervals without a meal. In order to _[[spells/Preserve|preserve]]_

energy between meals, a _somalcygot_ enters a trancelike

hibernation during which it burrows in circles beneath

the surface of its territory with unthinking repetition.

When it detects another creature nearby, the _somalcygot_

awakens and enters a frenzy to capitalize on the rare meal,

fighting relentlessly until the prey either dies or escapes.

Only rarely do somalcygots pursue prey beyond the

boundaries of their claimed hunting grounds, a tendency

that serves both to _preserve_ the creature’s energy and to

avoid needless conf lict with other somalcygots that claim

neighboring regions.

A typical adult _somalcygot_ is 16 feet long and weighs

1,500 pounds.
