   Earth elementals are plodding, stubborn creatures made of living stone or earth. When utterly still, they resemble a heap of stone or a small hill.

  When an earth elemental lumbers into action, its actual appearance can vary, although its statistics remain identical to other elementals of its size.

Bits of vegetation frequently grow in the soil that makes up parts of an earth elemental's body.
