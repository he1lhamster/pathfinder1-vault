special_abilities:
  Entreating Entrance (Su): While in the Boneyard, the Dead Roads, or the Material
    Plane, Barzahk can open new routes through the Dead Roads up to three times per
    day. This functions as if they had cast teleportation circle, but this new route
    lasts for only 1 hour unless Barzahk appoints a master for the route. A master
    can be any willing humanoid, monstrous humanoid, fey, or outsider with at least
    one neutral component to its alignment, who must thereafter reside permanently
    along that length of the Dead Roads. A master gains Barzahk's toss thee here ashore
    ability while in her domain, and creatures must gain a stamp of approval from
    the master to use that length of the Dead Roads. A length of the Dead Roads vanishes
    if its master dies or is absent for more than 1 hour.
  Loneliness Unbroken (Su): As a master of ways and lost things, Barzahk can decide
    when and if creatures leave their presence. Creatures that approach within 100
    feet of Barzahk cannot leave that radius unless the usher wills it, always looping
    back if they flee and returning to a random point within 100 feet.
  Ominous Bird of Yore (Ex): If slain within their domain, Barzahk immediately re-forms-growing
    from a random bird somewhere along the Dead Roads-with full hit points. They cannot
    use this ability for 1 month afterward.
  Toss Thee Here Ashore (Su): While on the Dead Roads, Barzahk can cast banishment
    at will, treating all creatures as if they had the extraplanar subtype. Creatures
    successfully banished are sent either to the Material Plane or the Boneyard, at
    Barzahk's discretion.
  Uncertain Rustling (Su): Barzahk never stands exactly where they seem to, their
    mastery of travel slightly displacing them even when at rest. They gain a +5 deflection
    bonus to AC, and all attacks targeting them have a 20% miss chance. True seeing
    and similar effects negate this miss chance, but not the deflection bonus to AC.
desc_long: |-
  Barzahk the Passage is among the youngest of Pharasma's ushers, having been born alongside (or, some suggest, as) the transitive Dead Roads that psychopomps use to travel the planes. Despite this relative youth, they still number among the oldest beings in creation, predating many archdevils, demon lords, empyreal lords, and even gods. Barzahk sees little new in this world, and a powerful boredom drives them to find wonder in small and personal things-the blooming of a flower, the rattle of a last breath, the tears of love that fall at a funeral. Whimsical and distracted, the usher rarely attends to their appointed duties for long and instead takes to wandering the planes to find new small wonders they can experience.

   Even with their disregard for duty, the Passage is obsessively protective of their domain, the Dead Roads, and most of their wanderings use this realm as a path. Barzahk's awareness extends along the length and breadth of these extraplanar routes, and the usher can cast trespassers from their realm as easily as a dog shakes off water-and often with the same dispassion.

   Enigmatic and distracted, Barzahk seems to have trouble recognizing individual servants and worshippers. It is appropriate that the usher of lost travelers and vigils for missing things likewise seems so lost at all times. With their master prone to long wanderings, those psychopomps who serve under the Passage enjoy an unprecedented level of freedom in how they carry out their duties, with many even establishing their own small domains like more powerful outsiders.

   In addition to the usual army of attendant psychopomps, Barzahk commands a unique resource: the way stations and their masters that pin the Dead Roads in space and time. As such, Barzahk can call upon a strange menagerie of outsiders, fey, and experts for specialized tasks. While the various entities Barzahk appoints have no compulsion to obey the Passage, the usher can easily retract the authority they grant, denying these servants an isolated, secure home and relative power.

   Barzahk normally wanders the Dead Roads among the faceless flocks of ravens, jays, vultures, and whippoorwills that infest the Dead Roads, but they sometimes assume a larger, more humanoid form. In this form, they stand just over 5 feet tall and weigh 200 pounds.

##### Description

Barzahk the Passage is among the youngest of Pharasma’s ushers, having been born alongside (or, some suggest, as) the transitive Dead Roads that psychopomps use to travel the planes. Despite this relative youth, they still number among the oldest beings in creation, predating many archdevils, demon lords, empyreal lords, and even gods. Barzahk sees little new in this world, and a powerful boredom drives them to find wonder in small and personal things—the blooming of a flower, the rattle of a last breath, the tears of love that fall at a funeral. Whimsical and distracted, the usher rarely attends to their appointed duties for long and instead takes to wandering the planes to find new small wonders they can experience.

Even with their disregard for duty, the Passage is obsessively protective of their domain, the Dead Roads, and most of their wanderings use this realm as a path. Barzahk’s awareness extends along the length and breadth of these extraplanar routes, and the usher can cast trespassers from their realm as easily as a _[[monsters/Dog|dog]]_ _[[diseases/Shakes|shakes]]_ off water—and often with the same dispassion.

Enigmatic and distracted, Barzahk seems to have trouble recognizing individual servants and worshippers. It is appropriate that the usher of lost travelers and vigils for missing things likewise seems so lost at all times. With their master _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ to long wanderings, those psychopomps who serve under the Passage enjoy an unprecedented level of _freedom_ in how they carry out their duties, with many even establishing their own small domains like more powerful outsiders.

In addition to the usual army of attendant psychopomps, Barzahk commands a unique resource: the way stations and their masters that pin the Dead Roads in space and time. As such, Barzahk can call upon a strange menagerie of outsiders, fey, and experts for specialized tasks.
