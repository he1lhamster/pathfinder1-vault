  Undying Loyalty (Su): When destroyed, a forsaken foot soldier leaves behind a ghostly
    green apparition that stands in the same square in which it was destroyed for
    24 hours. The apparition doesn't hinder movement through the square and cannot
    take actions, but the allies of the destroyed forsaken foot soldier treat the
    apparition as an ally for the purpose of flanking and using teamwork feats. If
    the forsaken foot soldier is destroyed with positive energy or holy water, this
    apparition does not appear.
desc_long: The greatest strength of the rank-and-file soldiers of the Jistka Imperium
  was their ability to work as a cohesive unit in stressful situations. Now powered
  by unholy energies, these legionnaires' loyalty transcends even death. Wherever
  groupings of forsaken legionnaires are found, there is always a solid number of
  foot soldiers, which still serve as the elite backbone of Jistkan companies even
  though they have long been forgotten.
