  Chest Container (Su): The chest cavity of a clockwork hound can be opened to expose
    a 6-inch-cube storage area that can hold up to 10 pounds of items. If a contained
    item is a magical necklace, ring, or ioun stone, then the hound gains the benefits
    of the item as though it were worn, but the hound can benefit from the effects
    of only one such item at a time (chosen by the person who placed the items inside).
    A clockwork hound can open or close its chest cavity as a swift action, depositing
    any items within onto the ground under it.
  Efficient Winding (Ex): A clockwork hound can function for 2 days per Hit Die every
    time it is wound (12 days for the typical clockwork hound).
  Expert Tracker (Ex): The hound gains a +8 racial bonus on Survival checks, and an
    additional +8 bonus when tracking by scent.
  Swift Bite (Ex): When a clockwork hound makes a full attack, it can make two bite
    attacks
desc_long: |-
  Clockwork hounds are artificial approximations of canine companions that operate much like their living counterparts but never die of natural causes. They can work in packs or alone, in accordance with the instructions imparted by their operators. Whether their operators are alive or dead is of little consequence to these constructs, which proceed based on the last instructions provided. 

  Like clockwork soldiers (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 57), clockwork hounds have long activity cycles due to the lessened winding requirements of their lighter frames. Their chest cavities are used to storage goods instead of for reinforcement. They are used primarily for delivery missions, but work equally well as retrievers. They're occasionally used for sentry duty, or more rarely, defense, and are most often seen in the company of similarly tasked constructs such as clockwork soldiers and guardians. A clockwork hound stands 2-1/2 feet tall at its shoulders and weighs 300 pounds
