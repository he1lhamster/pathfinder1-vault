### Special Abilities

**Digestive Enzyme (Ex)** A _[[monsters/Giant Belostomatid|giant belostomatid]]_ injects a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Corrosive|corrosive]]_ enzyme that paralyzes its prey. A creature bitten by this insect must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be _[[conditions/Paralyzed|paralyzed]]_ for 1d4 rounds. Each round, the creature can attempt a new save; on a failure it is still _paralyzed_ and takes 1d2 points of Constitution damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

The _giant belostomatid_ is an ambush predator that lurks in shallow water and hides amid floating snags and debris. Smaller versions of these insects are known colloquially as “toebiters,” yet this version of the creature is the size of a _[[monsters/Horse|horse]]_ and can sever the leg of a human in one bite.
