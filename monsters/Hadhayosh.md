  Frightful Charge (Su): A hadhayosh can inspire terror by charging or attacking.
    A creature charged by a hadhayosh must succeed on a DC 23 Will save or become
    paralyzed with fear, remaining in that condition as long as they stay within 60
    feet of the hadhayosh. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Godforged Horns (Ex): A hadhayosh's horns are treated as silver and cold iron for
    the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.
  Heat (Ex): A hadhayosh generates so much heat that its mere touch deals additional
    fire damage. A hadhayosh controls the heat it emits, allowing it to carry riders
    without harming them.
  Rush (Ex): Once per minute, the hadhayhosh can move at a speed of 150 feet.
  Stench (Ex): A foul musk clings to a hadhayosh. Living creatures within 100 feet
    must succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d6+4 minutes. A creature
    that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same hadhayosh's stench
    for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from
    a sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures
    resistant to poison receive their normal bonuses on their saving throws. The save
    DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  Created by a deity of the forge in ancient times, hadhayoshes tower over the lands, symbols of the power of the gods and the fury of the desert. While they look similar to oxen in general shape, these massive beasts have skin like beaten brass and flames that leap from their heads and backs in radiant manes. They are typically docile creatures motivated primarily by the urge to sleep, reproduce, and eat, in that order, though a certain wanderlust afflicts the beasts, causing them to roam over vast territories. When angered, hadhayoshes become ferocious, striking out with rage at any creature that would dare to challenge them. They are not accustomed to lesser creatures causing trouble for them, though they often find themselves prey for other giants such as dragons.

  Strangely uniform in size, as if measured to divine specifics, all adult hadhayoshes stand 52 feet tall and weigh exactly 57 tons.

##### Description

Created by a deity of the forge in ancient times, hadhayoshes tower over the lands, symbols of the power of the gods and the fury of the desert. While they look similar to oxen in general shape, these massive beasts have skin like beaten brass and flames that leap from their heads and backs in _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Radiant|radiant]]_ manes. They are typically docile creatures motivated primarily by the urge to sleep, reproduce, and eat, in that order, though a certain wanderlust afflicts the beasts, causing them to roam over vast territories. When angered, hadhayoshes become ferocious, striking out with _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ at any creature that would dare to challenge them. They are not accustomed to lesser creatures causing trouble for them, though they often find themselves prey for other giants such as dragons.
