  Lunge (Ex): As a full-round action, a weremantis in hybrid form can make a single
    attack with both claws at double its normal reach. When a weremantis attacks in
    this manner, it gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls. A weremantis can't make attacks
    of opportunities with its lunge.
  Mandibles (Ex): A weremantis in hybrid form that grabs a foe can make a bite attack
    against that foe as a secondary attack. The weremantis's bite has an attack bonus
    of -1, deals 1d6+1 points of piercing damage on a hit, and carries the curse of
    entothropy.
  Sudden Strike (Ex): During a surprise round, a weremantis in hybrid form can act
    as if it had a full round to act, rather than just one standard action.
desc_long: In humanoid form, natural weremantises are often tall and long-limbed.
  Many have pointy chins and brilliant green eyes that seem slightly too large for
  their faces. They tend to be solitary individuals, explaining their distant attitudes
  as a form of spirituality or piety. However, when they do make friends or take lovers,
  the relationships burn brightly for a short time. Eventually, though, the weremantises
  grow bored with the associations and end them in an equally dramatic manner, often
  through violent murders.
