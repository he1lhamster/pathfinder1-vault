desc_long: Popotos are the smallest species of dolphin known, and they generally swim
  in shallow waters near shorelines. Sometimes they manage to swim miles upriver when
  they hunt for fish, using echolocation to navigate through smaller channels. They
  are social hunters and traveling in small groups called pods, which normally contain
  three to five popotos. Like larger dolphins, popotos are popular with seafarers,
  who consider the creatures to be good luck and tell hopeful tales of popotos leading
  lost swimmers to shore and pods fighting off sharks that are much larger than the
  popotos themselves.

##### Description

Popotos are the smallest species of _[[monsters/Dolphin|dolphin]]_ known, and they generally swim in shallow waters near shorelines. Sometimes they manage to swim miles upriver when they hunt for fish, using _[[spells/Echolocation|echolocation]]_ to navigate through smaller channels. They are social hunters and traveling in small groups _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ pods, which normally contain three to five popotos. Like larger dolphins, popotos are popular with seafarers, who consider the creatures to be good luck and tell hopeful tales of popotos leading lost swimmers to shore and pods fighting off sharks that are much larger than the popotos themselves.
