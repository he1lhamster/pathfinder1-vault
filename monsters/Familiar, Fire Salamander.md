  Skin Secretions (Ex): A creature that strikes a fire salamander with an unarmed
    strike or natural weapon exposes itself to the salamander's toxic skin and must
    immediately succeed at a DC 9 Fortitude save to resist being sickened for 1 round.
    The secretions also make the salamander difficult to grab, giving it a +4 racial
    bonus on Escape Artist checks. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
  Despite their name, fire salamanders have nothing to do with the evil outsiders known as salamanders. These are Diminutive poisonous amphibians that can live more than 50 years. They are most active after dusk, eating earthworms, insects, slugs, and spiders. During the day, they hide amid fallen leaves or near mossy tree trunks.

   Fire salamanders are 6 to 10 inches long and weigh only 2 ounces.
