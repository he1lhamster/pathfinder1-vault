    making a bite attack, the ragworm turns its throat inside out and extends its
    jaws with surprising speed. This not only extends the ragworm's reach with its
    bite attack, but it also gives it a +4 bonus on attack rolls with its bite during
    surprise rounds.
  Poison (Ex): Slam or tail slap-injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 6
    rounds; effect 1d4 Dex damage and 1d2 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The
    save DC is Constitution-based.
  Vortex Attack (Ex): Three times per day as a standard action, king ragworm can undulate
    its body inside its burrow to create a vortex, drawing anything within a 15-foot
    cone toward the burrow's entrance. Large and smaller creatures caught in this
    vortex must succeed at a DC 26 Reflex save or be pulled into the ragworm's burrow,
    potentially provoking attacks of opportunity. Attacks of opportunity caused by
    this ability can't be avoided with Acrobatics (though attacks of opportunity provoked
    in other ways, such as by moving out of one of the ragworm's threatened squares,
    can be avoided as normal). The save DC is Dexterity-based.
desc_long: The giant king ragworm, found in the far depths of the ocean, is among

  where it resides most of the time.
