  White Hairs (Su): An ohancanu has 2d4 white hairs that connect not only to its head,
    but to its essence. If one of these hairs is plucked with a successful steal combat
    maneuver (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 322), the ohancanu gains 2 negative
    levels. The ohancanu automatically regrows the lost white hair and recovers the
    negative levels after 24 hours.

  Ohancanus are massive, brutal forest creatures that delight in destruction. Appearing as giant humanoids, ohancanus are thick and powerfully muscled, with simian arms that reach nearly to the ground. Although ohancanus have a single eye in the center of their foreheads, they are fey creatures and unrelated to the ancient cyclops race. Ohancanus have wide noses and large mouths filled with blunt teeth. All ohancanus are hirsute; males have full, thick beards and the rare females (called ohancanas) have long, unruly hair on their heads. All ohancanus have dark hair with a few white strands; on males, these white strands grow in their beards, while on females, they sprout from their heads. The white strands anchor the ohancanu's essence, so pulling out these strands causes the fey to weaken and die.

  An ohancanu stands 10 feet tall and weighs about 800 pounds.
