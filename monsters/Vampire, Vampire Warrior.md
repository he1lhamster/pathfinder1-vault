special_abilities:
  Drain Chi (Su): Instead of draining blood, a jiang-shi vampire drains “chi,” or
    life energy, from a victim's breath. When a jiang-shi makes a successful grapple
    check (in addition to any other effects caused by a successful check, including
    additional damage), the jiang-shi can attempt to drain chi by drinking the victim's
    breath. The victim can resist this attack by succeeding at a DC 17 Fortitude save.
    On a failed save, the victim gains 1 negative level and is staggered for 1d4 rounds.
  Poison (Ex): 'Vishkanya Venom: Weapon-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round
    for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex; cure 1 save.'
  Prayer Scroll (Su): The scroll attached to the brow of a jiang-shi grants immunity
    to any effects generated by spell-completion or spelltrigger magic items, such
    as scrolls and wands. Such magical effects treat the jiang-shi as if she had unbeatable
    spell resistance. A jiang-shi's prayer scroll can be removed with a successful
    steal combat maneuver (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 322), which immediately
    ends the jiang-shi's immunity to these effects. If a jiang-shi's prayer scroll
    is destroyed (a standard action), the vampire also loses her fast healing ability.
    A jiangshi can create a replacement prayer scroll by using any strip of parchment
    and a writing instrument, but doing so requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted work.
  Toxic (Ex): Four times per day as a swift action, a vishkanya can envenom a weapon
    that she wields with her toxic saliva or blood.
desc_long: When this vishkanya was alive, she pursued the path of the samurai, but
  wasn't allowed to join their honorable ranks. Her restless spirit remained trapped
  in her flesh after death, and eventually she animated her own rotting body and sought
  out those who had wronged her.
