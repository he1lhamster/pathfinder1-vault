##### Description

Esipils prey upon the unease that comes from

living among beasts. The civilized world has

domesticated animals, but those creatures are just a

step away from wild animals, and esipils make sure

that humanoids who live around them remember that.

They ingratiate themselves with humanoids (particularly

neutral evil spellcasters who might take them on as

familiars) by acting like loving pets. They then delight in

aggressive episodes, barking and snapping until _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_

down by their masters. They return to a fawning obedience

for a time—until the next inevitable outburst.

Instead of gnashing jaws, an esipil’s bite involves a

lashing mass of f leshy veins and viscera that can _[[spells/Grasp|grasp]]_ at its

opponent. Esipils use this attack to distract their opponents,

savaging _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_ victims with their _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_ claw attacks

until their masters _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ them away.

Although an esipil’s ability to frighten its victims is

_[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_, it relies on its _cause fear_ spell-like ability only when

grossly outnumbered, outmatched, or greatly injured.

Esipils like to fight and scrap with nearly anything, and

prefer that their victims not simply f lee in terror, as they

_[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ to savor the _fear_. Esipils use their telepathic abilities

to harass would-be opponents into attacking them first,

f linging mental taunts that are vulgar and disconcerting.

Once they engage, they are resilient and dogged fighters.

An esipil stands 1 foot tall at the shoulder, and its thin,

wormlike body stretches nearly 3 feet long. An esipil weighs

around 13 pounds.

Though they make unruly companions, esipils actually

enjoy serving those mightier than themselves, taking pride

in their masters’ power, even if they continue to snap and

snarl when given commands.

A neutral evil spellcaster

of at least 7th level who

takes the Improved

Familiar feat can

select an esipil as

a familiar.
