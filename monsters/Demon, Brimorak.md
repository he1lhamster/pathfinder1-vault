  Burning Hooves (Su): A brimorak's burning hooves leave scorched prints. Survival
    checks to track a brimorak are attempted with a +8 circumstance bonus. Against
    a prone foe, a brimorak can make two hoof attacks rather than just one.
  Flaming Weapon (Su): As a free action, a brimorak can cause a single wielded melee
    weapon to deal 1d6 additional points of fire damage on a successful hit. This
    fire damage stacks with any fire damage that the weapon might also deal. The weapon
    loses this ability if it leaves the demon's grasp.
  Smoke Breath (Su): A brimorak's breath surrounds it to a radius of 5 feet. A creature
    who begins its turn in this area must make a successful DC 17 Fortitude save or
    become sickened for 1 round. A creature gains immunity to a particular brimorak's
    breath for 24 hours with a successful save. This is a poison effect. The save
    DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: Brimoraks are demons born from the souls of arsonists, and in their fiendish
  lives, they love nothing more than setting fires. A brimorak stands 3 feet tall
  and weighs 80 pounds.
