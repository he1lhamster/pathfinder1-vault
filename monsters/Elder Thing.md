  Hibernation (Ex): An elder thing can enter a state of hibernation at will; doing
    so takes 1 minute. While in this state, it can take no actions and is effectively
    helpless, as if it were in a deep sleep. An elder thing can remain in hibernation
    for as long as it wishes- while in this state, it does not need to eat or drink,
    nor does it age. Time effectively stands still for a hibernating elder thing.
    If it is jostled or damaged while hibernating, an elder thing can attempt a DC
    20 Will save. If it succeeds, it awakens in 2d4 rounds. Otherwise, it takes 1d4
    days to awaken from hibernation. An elder thing can set the length of its hibernation
    when it first enters this state, so that it can awaken after a set amount of time
    has passed. When awakening at a set time in this manner, an elder thing needs
    only 1d3 rounds to rouse itself, with no Will saving throw necessary.
  Limited Starflight (Ex): An elder thing can survive in the void of outer space,
    and its wings allow it to use its fly speed in that environment despite the lack
    of air. Unlike creatures with full starflight, an elder thing's ability to fly
    in outer space does not allow it to reach unusually high speeds-an elder thing
    that wishes to travel from one planet to another typically calculates the distance
    and then hibernates for the majority of the journey, relying on its momentum and
    inertia to carry it to its destination while it slumbers along the way.

### Special Abilities

**Hibernation (Ex)** An _elder thing_ can enter a state of hibernation at will; doing so takes 1 minute. While in this state, it can take no actions and is effectively _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_, as if it were in a deep sleep. An _elder thing_ can remain in hibernation for as long as it wishes— while in this state, it does not need to eat or drink, nor does it age. Time effectively stands still for a hibernating _elder thing_. If it is jostled or damaged while hibernating, an _elder thing_ can attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it succeeds, it awakens in 2d4 rounds. Otherwise, it takes 1d4 days to _[[spells/Awaken|awaken]]_ from hibernation. An _elder thing_ can set the length of its hibernation when it first enters this state, so that it can _awaken_ after a set amount of time has passed. When awakening at a set time in this manner, an _elder thing_ needs only 1d3 rounds to rouse itself, with no Will saving throw necessary.

**Limited Starflight (Ex)** An _elder thing_ can survive in the void of outer space, and its wings allow it to use its fly speed in that environment despite the lack of air.

##### Description

Known by various names on various worlds, but most often as “elder things” or “old ones,” these alien creatures are interested in creating lasting works of art, architecture, and even life (such as the dreaded shoggoths). They possess a boundless capacity for war and egotism.

A typical _elder thing_ is 6 feet tall from head to foot, with a 7-foot wingspan. Surprisingly heavy for its size, an _elder thing_ generally weighs about 450 pounds.
