  Crippling Bite (Ex): A slicer beetle's bite attack threatens a critical hit on a
    roll of 19-20. If a slicer beetle scores a critical hit on a target, its mandibles
    cut deep, resulting in a wound that causes 1d6 bleed and leaving its foe staggered
    for 1d3 rounds from the tremendous pain dealt.
desc_long: The slicer beetle sports specialized mouthparts that scissor apart flesh
  for easier consumption. Each side of its horizontally closing mandibles fits into
  the other with barely a hair's breadth to spare. These creatures prefer to dwell
  in compact caves or warrens. A typical slicer beetle measures 10 feet long and weighs
  800 pounds.
