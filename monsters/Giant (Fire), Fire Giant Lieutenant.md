##### Description

## Giant Dire _Boar_ _Mount_

Giant dire _boar_ (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 36, 295)
**hp** 52

Kings and queens direct the movements and strategies of entire armies, but fire giant lieutenants _[[spells/Command|command]]_ the rank-and-file soldiers on the battlefield from atop their massive mounts. Fire giant lieutenants are superb tacticians, and they inspire the troops under their _command_. The lieutenants know that to flee battle is to incur the wrath of their _[[npcs/King|king]]_ or queen.

The giant dire _boar_ presented above functions as a _mount_ for the fire giant lieutenant’s _mount_ ability.
