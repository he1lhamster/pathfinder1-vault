##### Description

The leaders of small _orc_ warbands aren’t much smarter or more _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cunning|cunning]]_ than the rank-and-file _orc_ warriors they lead—but just a small advantage in strength is enough to let them take the best shares of treasure and slaves and lord their dominance over their fellow orcs. _Orc_ commanders enforce discipline through intimidation and are not afraid to lead underlings to their deaths.
