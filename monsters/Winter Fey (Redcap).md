  Boot Stomp (Ex): A winter redcap wears heavy iron boots with spiked soles that it
    uses to deadly effect in combat. These boots give the winter redcap a kick attack
    that it can make as a secondary attack, either as part of a full-attack action
    or as part of its movement, just as if it had the Spring Attack feat.
  Heavy Weapons (Ex): A winter redcap can wield weapons sized for Medium creatures
    without penalty.
  Irreligious (Ex): Bitter and blasphemous, winter redcaps cannot stand the symbols
    of good-aligned religions. If a foe spends a standard action presenting such a
    holy symbol, any winter redcap that can see the creature must succeed at a DC
    15 Will save or become frightened for 1 minute and attempt to flee. A winter redcap
    who successfully saves is shaken for 1 minute.
  Red Cap (Su): A winter redcap wears a tiny, shapeless woolen hat, dyed over and
    over with the blood of its victims. While wearing this cap, a winter redcap gains
    a +4 bonus on damage rolls (included in the above totals) and fast healing 3.
    These benefits are lost if the cap is removed or destroyed. Caps are not transferable,
    even between other redcaps. A winter redcap can create a new cap to replace a
    lost cap with 10 minutes of work, but until the winter redcap takes a standard
    action to dip the cap in the blood of a foe the winter redcap helped to kill,
    the cap does not grant its bonuses.
desc_long: Infused with the primal power of winter's chill, a winter fey possesses
  the power to freeze its victims with a mere touch. It is said that this wintery
  power freezes the heart of any normally good fey, corrupting the creature's nature
  and infusing it with hatred and spite. While a winter fey is visually recognizable
  as being a variant of its normal counterpart, its personality is decidedly altered.
  Whereas most fey are merely capricious and whimsical, winter fey take pleasure in
  causing pain and suffering. A winter fey is the same size as its normal counterparts,
  but it typically weighs a bit more because of the ice crusting its body.

##### Description

Infused with the primal power of winter’s chill, a winter fey possesses the power to _[[universal monster rules/Freeze|freeze]]_ its victims with a mere touch. It is said that this wintery power freezes the heart of any normally good fey, corrupting the creature’s nature and infusing it with hatred and _[[spells/Spite|spite]]_. While a winter fey is visually recognizable as being a variant of its normal counterpart, its personality is decidedly altered. Whereas most fey are merely capricious and whimsical, winter fey take pleasure in causing pain and suffering. A winter fey is the same size as its normal counterparts, but it typically weighs a bit more because of the ice crusting its body.
