  Adaptive Form (Su): The slam attack of an adaptive ooze gains a temporary additional
    damage type (slashing or piercing) whenever it has damage reduction against that
    type from its adaptive resistance ability. This damage type lasts until the ooze
    no longer has that type of damage reduction. The adaptive ooze can also reproduce
    an energy type it comes into contact with. The ooze's slam attack deals an additional
    2d6 points of energy damage of a single energy type randomly chosen from the types
    of energy it is currently immune to due to its adaptive resistance ability.
  Adaptive Resistance (Su): An adaptive ooze can rapidly develop resistances to its
    most pressing threats. When the adaptive ooze takes bludgeoning, slashing, or
    piercing damage, it gains DR 10/adamantine against that damage type starting at
    the beginning of its next turn. This DR lasts for 1 hour. Additionally, when an
    adaptive ooze takes hit point damage from a particular type of energy (acid, cold,
    electricity, fire, or sonic), it gains immunity to that energy type starting at
    the beginning of its next turn. The adaptive ooze can maintain immunity to only
    three energy types at once, losing the oldest immunity it has when it takes hit
    point damage of a fourth energy type. This immunity lasts for 1 hour or until
    it is replaced with a new immunity.
desc_long: |-
  Adaptive oozes are composed of an amorphous substance that flows like liquid metal, but they can harden this form to a consistency resembling tempered steel. When adaptive oozes attack, they form pseudopods that strike out at targets and take on characteristics of weapons the oozes have recently been struck by. They can also assimilate different energies into their forms, becoming immune to them and even reproducing them for a limited time. Adaptive oozes can break down both organic and inorganic substances and incorporate those materials into their bodies to grow their mass. They are especially drawn to organic creatures that have more complex compositions. However, their digestive process is very slow, so they need to disable creatures that might fight back or attempt to flee. Adaptive oozes go through a cycle of accumulating mass until they split into two in order to propagate, after which the cycle begins anew. Adaptive oozes that have just split begin life with the young creature simple template. Adaptive oozes that are in resource-rich areas can accumulate mass very rapidly, gaining the giant creature simple template before they reach the end of their reproductive cycle. These huge adaptive oozes can split into more than two parts when they divide.

   Adaptive oozes can achieve a height of 8 feet, taking on an almost spherical form when stationary, and weigh about 2,200 pounds.

This damage type lasts until the ooze no longer has that type of _damage reduction_. The _adaptive ooze_ can also reproduce an energy type it comes into contact with. The ooze’s slam attack deals an additional 2d6 points of energy damage of a single energy type randomly chosen from the types of energy it is currently immune to due to its adaptive _resistance_ ability.

**Adaptive _Resistance_ (Su)** An _adaptive ooze_ can rapidly develop resistances to its most pressing threats. When the _adaptive ooze_ takes bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage, it gains DR 10/adamantine against that damage type starting at the beginning of its next turn. This DR lasts for 1 hour. Additionally, when an _adaptive ooze_ takes hit point damage from a particular type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), it gains _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to that energy type starting at the beginning of its next turn. The _adaptive ooze_ can maintain _immunity_ to only three energy types at once, losing the oldest _immunity_ it has when it takes hit point damage of a fourth energy type. This _immunity_ lasts for 1 hour or until it is replaced with a new _immunity_.

##### Description

Adaptive oozes are composed of an _[[universal monster rules/Amorphous|amorphous]]_ substance that flows like liquid metal, but they can harden this form to a consistency resembling tempered steel. When adaptive oozes attack, they form pseudopods that strike out at targets and take on characteristics of weapons the oozes have recently been struck by. They can also assimilate different energies into their forms, becoming immune to them and even reproducing them for a limited time. Adaptive oozes can break down both organic and inorganic substances and incorporate those materials into their bodies to grow their mass. They are especially drawn to organic creatures that have more complex compositions. However, their digestive process is very _[[spells/Slow|slow]]_, so they need to disable creatures that might fight back or attempt to flee. Adaptive oozes go through a cycle of accumulating mass until they _[[universal monster rules/Split|split]]_ into two in order to propagate, after which the cycle begins anew. Adaptive oozes that have just _split_ begin life with the young creature simple template. Adaptive oozes that are in resource-rich areas can accumulate mass very rapidly, gaining the giant creature simple template before they reach the end of their reproductive cycle. These huge adaptive oozes can _split_ into more than two parts when they divide.

Adaptive oozes can achieve a height of 8 feet, taking on an almost spherical form when stationary, and weigh about 2,200 pounds.
