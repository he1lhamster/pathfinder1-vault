    a DC 16 Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is nauseated for 1d4 rounds,
    and on a success the creature is staggered for 1 round. A festering spirit's slime
    persists on objects and creatures for 1d10 minutes but has no harmful effect after
    its initial contact. Creatures immune to poison or disease are immune to this

  A festering spirit arises when a vile person's corpse is put in a mass grave, or when such a person is buried, exhumed, and placed in a charnel house or ossuary. The lingering hatred and evil of the dead mixes with the worst remnants of dozens of other people, creating a frustrated incorporeal shade of sickness, hate, and rot. Powerful mortals might arise as multiple festering spirits, each spawned from a different aspect of the original creature's personality.

  A festering spirit can't travel more than a mile from its remains. When left alone for long periods, a festering spirit usually wanders the halls and rooms near its burial site, destroying things, indulging in pranks, or trying to eat and drink anything it finds palatable (which falls through its incorporeal body to no effect). Its senses can barely detect these treats, though some adventurers report that strong alcohol and spicy foods can distract the spirit as it savors these sensations.

##### Description

A _festering spirit_ arises when a vile person’s corpse is put in a mass grave, or when such a person is buried, exhumed, and placed in a _[[spells/Charnel House|charnel house]]_ or ossuary. The lingering hatred and evil of the dead mixes with the worst remnants of dozens of other people, creating a frustrated _incorporeal_ shade of sickness, hate, and rot. Powerful mortals might arise as multiple festering spirits, each spawned from a different aspect of the original creature’s personality.

A _festering spirit_ can’t travel more than a mile from its remains. When left alone for long periods, a _festering spirit_ usually wanders the halls and rooms near its burial site, destroying things, indulging in pranks, or trying to eat and drink anything it finds palatable (which falls through its _incorporeal_ body to no effect). Its senses can barely detect these treats, though some adventurers report that strong alcohol and spicy foods can distract the spirit as it savors these sensations.
