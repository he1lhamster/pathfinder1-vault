### Special Abilities

**Entangling Train (Su)** Creatures adjacent to a pakalchi must

succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or become _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_ in

its vines for 1 round, and count as tethered. _Entangled_

creatures take vine damage automatically each round

they’re _entangled_. Creatures are no longer _entangled_ if the

pakalchi moves away. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Look of _Fear_ (Su)** A creature affected by a pakalchi’s _[[universal monster rules/Gaze|gaze]]_ is

_[[conditions/Panicked|panicked]]_ for 1 round and _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 1d4 rounds thereafter.

A creature that successfully saves against this effect is only

_shaken_ for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Poison (Ex)** Thorns—injury; save Fort DC 22; frequency

1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Wis damage; cure 2

consecutive saves. A creature with Wisdom damage

from a pakalchi’s poison hears paranoid whispers

warning of betrayal. It can’t treat any other

creature as an ally or be a willing target for a spell

or effect. This is an emotion effect.
**Sudden Strike (Ex)** Once per round, a pakalchi can

extend the reach of one claw or thorned vine by 5 feet as

part of a single attack. It can use this ability to threaten

additional squares to cause an enemy to

provoke an attack of opportunity.

**Thorns (Ex)** A pakalchi can _[[feats/Fling|fling]]_ a

volley of poisonous thorns as a standard

action (make an attack roll for each

thorn). This attack has a range of 100 feet

with no range increment.

##### Description

Pakalchis feed on the _fear_ and insecurity of

failing relationships. They delight in seeing

social bonds _[[spells/Shatter|shatter]]_, as _[[spells/They Know|they know]]_ that mortals

_[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ or set adrift by such conf licts are

more susceptible to their malign inf luence.

Consummate puppetmasters, pakalchis use

their powers of domination to turn friends and

lovers against each other, relishing how even a

single word can cause an avalanche of _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_

as _panicked_ victims make their situations worse.

Pakalchis then draw the despondent mortals to

their sides, playing cat-and-mouse games and

slowly increasing physical and psychological

pressure until their quarry breaks.

While they may sometimes work though

intermediaries, these creatures prefer to

personally _[[spells/Witness|witness]]_ the anxiety they cause.

Pakalchis stand 7 feet tall and weigh

160 pounds.
