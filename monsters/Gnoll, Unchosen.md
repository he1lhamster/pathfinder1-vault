# Gnoll, Unchosen
A hulking monstrosity lumbers forth, its canine jaws snapping ferociously. Its matted, speckled hide and hyena-like cackle hint at its animalistic nature, yet it walks like a man, even though its grotesque proportions seem wholly unnatural. A circular patch of thickened, _[[monsters/Gray|gray]]_ scar tissue nestles in the filthy fur in the center of its forehead.
