  prey, the sea scourge will feed on whatever creatures it can manage to get a hold
  of, and is known to prey on humanoids both in shallow waters and at sea, even going
  so far as to board seagoing vessels. A sea scourge's acid is capable of dissolving
  wood in addition to flesh and bone, making it a particularly dangerous threat to
  most boats. Though it can swim beneath the waves indefinitely, a sea scourge more
  often tends to search the surface of the ocean for prey, camouf laged as a large
  clump of ambergris or other seaborne excretion.

##### Description

On watch at night in warm seas, wise sailors are especially _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Vigilant|vigilant]]_ for the hated _sea scourge_, an ooze that has adapted itself so well to its maritime habitat as to become a significant hazard to native oceanic creatures as well as to humanoid seafarers. While its typical diet consists of sea turtles, dugongs, and other aquatic prey, the _sea scourge_ will feed on whatever creatures it can manage to get a hold of, and is known to prey on humanoids both in shallow waters and at sea, even going so far as to board seagoing vessels. A _sea scourge_’s acid is capable of dissolving wood in addition to flesh and bone, making it a particularly dangerous threat to most boats. Though it can swim beneath the waves indefinitely, a _sea scourge_ more often tends to search the surface of the ocean for prey, camouf laged as a large clump of ambergris or other _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Seaborne|seaborne]]_ excretion.
