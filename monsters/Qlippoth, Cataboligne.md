    to an adjacent structure.
  Devastating Strike (Ex): A cataboligne's slam attacks ignore the first 10 points
    of hardness of objects and creatures it damages. A creature struck with a critical
    hit from a cataboligne's tail slap must succeed at a DC 34 Fortitude save or be
    stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based.
  Disintegration Beam (Su): As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a cataboligne
    can unleash a concentrated beam of pure obliteration from the spiky growth on
    its back. The cataboligne makes a separate ranged touch attack roll against each
    creature in a 60-foot line. Roll to confirm each critical threat separately. A
    creature or object hit by the disintegration beam takes 20d6 points of damage.
    An affected creature can reduce the damage to 5d6 with a successful DC 26 Fortitude
    save. Any creature reduced to 0 hit points or fewer by the disintegration beam
    is turned to dust and killed, as per disintegrate. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Horrific Appearance (Su): Creatures that succumb to a cataboligne's horrific appearance
    feel as though their bodies were falling to pieces. Affected creatures take 1d4
    points of Dexterity damage.
  Poison (Ex): Bite-injury; save Fort DC 26; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect
    1d4 Constitution drain plus stunned for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves. The
    save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
  Catabolignes are the devastating siege engines of the qlippoth, rampaging among demonic fortifications and unmaking everything in their path. The treelike growth on a cataboligne's back is capable of unleashing a beam of entropic power that turns all it touches to dust, while its mouth drools a terrible flesh-eating poison. Oddly, catabolignes do not seem hostile toward proteans, who will often merrily lead these devastating qlippoth on destructive sprees. 

  A cataboligne is 30 feet tall and 40 feet long, and weighs 16 tons.
