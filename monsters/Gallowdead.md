  Aura of Whispers (Su): A gallowdead constantly whispers vile secrets and blasphemous
    chants. Any creature within 30 feet of a gallowdead must succeed at a DC 27 Will
    save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. Already shaken creatures that fail this saving
    throw become nauseated by the secrets revealed. Each round, an affected creature
    can make a new Will save to recover from the effect-once a creature recovers from
    a gallowdead's whispers, it is immune to this ability for 24 hours. Each overlapping
    whisper aura from additional gallowdead increases the save DC by 2. This is a
    language-based sonic effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Chains of the Dead (Su): When a gallowdead uses its spiked chain, the first attack
    that hits a foe during the gallowdead's turn deals an extra 12d6 points of negative
    energy damage (Will DC 27 half). This has no effect on undead creatures. In addition,
    the gallowdead can make a free combat maneuver check against its target with a
    +4 racial bonus. If the check succeeds, the target becomes grappled, but the gallowdead
    doesn't gain the grappled condition. The gallowdead can make a free combat maneuver
    check each round to maintain its grip on the victim, but can't take any special
    grapple actions against the victim except the move special action. When grappling
    a victim in this way, the gallowdead can't attack with its spiked chain. The save
    DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: 'Some tyrants execute criminals, traitors, or those who dare insurrection
  on the end of hooked and spiked chains. Leaving the criminal to painfully hang and
  rot sends a message to those who would dare commit the same crimes. Sometimes such
  savage deaths have a strange and terrible consequence: the victim rises, grabs the
  instrument of its execution, and becomes a servant of those who condemned it.'

### Special Abilities

**Aura of Whispers (Su)** A _[[monsters/Gallowdead|gallowdead]]_ constantly whispers vile secrets and blasphemous chants. Any creature within 30 feet of a _gallowdead_ must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 1d4 rounds. Already _shaken_ creatures that fail this saving throw become _[[conditions/Nauseated|nauseated]]_ by the secrets revealed. Each round, an affected creature can make a new Will save to recover from the effect—once a creature recovers from a _gallowdead_’s whispers, it is immune to this ability for 24 hours. Each overlapping whisper aura from additional _gallowdead_ increases the save DC by 2. This is a language-based sonic effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Chains of the Dead (Su)** When a _gallowdead_ uses its _spiked chain_, the first attack that hits a foe during the _gallowdead_’s turn deals an extra 12d6 points of negative energy damage (Will DC 27 half). This has no effect on undead creatures. In addition, the _gallowdead_ can make a free combat maneuver check against its target with a +4 racial bonus. If the check succeeds, the target becomes _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_, but the _gallowdead_ doesn’t gain the _grappled_ condition. The _gallowdead_ can make a free combat maneuver check each round to maintain its grip on the victim, but can’t take any special grapple actions against the victim except the move special action. When grappling a victim in this way, the _gallowdead_ can’t attack with its _spiked chain_. The save DC is Charisma-based.

##### Description

Some tyrants execute criminals, traitors, or those who dare insurrection on the end of hooked and spiked chains. Leaving the criminal to painfully hang and rot sends a _[[spells/Message|message]]_ to those who would dare commit the same crimes. Sometimes such savage deaths have a strange and terrible consequence: the victim rises, grabs the instrument of its execution, and becomes a servant of those who condemned it.
