# Grendler Red-Chains
Shards of _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ manacles, links of chain, and iron flails are
imbedded in this hideous, human-sized man’s ruddy flesh.
Rivulets of congealing blood run from its soaked cap down its
mangled face and neck, soaking its tangled white beard; in its
arms looms a rusty but clearly sharp _[[items/Weapon/Scythe|scythe]]_.

##### Description

It’s said the latent suffering in Varisia’s Hollow
Mountain—where Thassilonian slaves long ago carved
out a labyrinth of intricate corridors—not only attracted
_[[monsters/Grendler Red-Chains|Grendler Red-Chains]]_ but helped him grow to a size
considered monstrous for a _redcap_. The height of a short
man, _Grendler Red-Chains_ stalks the mountain’s tunnels
with aplomb, terrorizing adventurers and the complex’s
denizens alike with his wicked _scythe_ and spiked boots.
Perhaps because of his larger size, he heals faster than
most redcaps; he enjoys self-mutilation almost as much
as he enjoys dipping his cap in his victims’ blood. Over
the years, _Grendler Red-Chains_ has culled bits of chains
and shackles from the corpses of long-dead slaves and
embedded them into his own flesh, both to terrify his
enemies and to fortify his defenses.
