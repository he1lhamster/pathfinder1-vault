    Creatures bitten by a medusa head must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or turn to stone for 1d4 rounds. Targets immune to poison are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

    Beheaded are f loating skulls or severed heads whose bodies have long since abandoned them, either in the moment of death or long after.
