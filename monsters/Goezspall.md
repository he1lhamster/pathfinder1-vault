special_abilities:
  Hibernate (Ex): Although it can live in extreme conditions, a goezspall still requires
    food and water. To survive when sustenance is not available, a goezspall can enter
    a state of hibernation at will; doing so takes 1 minute. While in this state,
    it can take no actions and is effectively helpless, as if it were in a deep sleep.
    A goezspall can remain in hibernation for as long as it wishes-while in this state,
    it does not need to eat or drink, nor does it age. Time effectively stands still
    for the creature. If a goezspall is jostled or damaged while hibernating, it can
    attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it succeeds, it awakens in 2d4 rounds. Otherwise,
    it takes 24 hours to awaken from hibernation. A goezspall can set the length of
    its hibernation when it first enters this state, so that it can awaken after a
    set amount of time has passed. When awakening at a set time in this manner, a
    goezspall needs only 1d3 rounds to rouse itself, with no Will saving throw necessary.
  Immune to Pressure Damage (Ex): A goezspall can survive in extreme conditions. A
    goezspall is immune to damage caused by high-pressure environments such as deep
    underwater and low-pressure environments such as the void of space.
  Scalding Spray (Su): As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a goezspall can
    spray a 60-foot line of scalding water at its enemies that deals 12d6 points of
    fire damage (Reflex DC 25 half). This stream acts as a bull rush against creatures
    of any size. When using this ability, a goezspall attempts a combat maneuver check
    and applies its results to each creature within the area. This bull rush does
    not provoke attacks of opportunity. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: Though rare, goezspalls have been observed living in extremely varied locations.
  From the frozen north to the depths of the deepest caverns, these bizarre, segmented
  creatures thrive in any environment, including the depths of the sea, boiling hot
  springs, and even, some claim, the void of space. Though not typically hostile,
  these omnivores hunt aggressively when hungry, especially after months or years
  in hibernation. A goezspall is 14 feet long and weighs 3,500 pounds, though some
  lore describes smaller and larger specimens.

Otherwise, it takes 24 hours to _[[spells/Awaken|awaken]]_ from hibernation. A _goezspall_ can set the length of its hibernation when it first enters this state, so that it can _awaken_ after a set amount of time has passed.

**Immune to Pressure Damage (Ex)** A _goezspall_ can survive in extreme conditions. A _goezspall_ is immune to damage caused by high-pressure environments such as deep _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_ and low-pressure environments such as the void of space.
