  Travelers passing by the Churlwood in Varisia might hear tales of a longlived sasquatch who has inhabited the woods for almost 50 years now. Trackers recognize the sasquatch's unique trail thanks to a birth defect that left the sasquatch with a distinctive gait. Locals in the area refer to the sasquatch by nicknames such as “Old Limpy,” but the Shoanti call the honored being Paakis-si.

  Many among the Shoanti claim that Paakis-si has lived for thousands of years. They poetically describe Paakis-si as more nature spirit than living creature, a guardian of the woods who protects the natural creatures and punishes those who would seek to despoil the sacred land. The scar that runs across his face and the soul-piercing gaze of his cerulean eyes lends evidence to the Shoanti's fables, and those who encounter the legendary sasquatch know he is no ordinary member of his elusive species. The magical tree branch he wields as a deadly club lends further evidence to such claims, and many believe the ancient being found his weapon at the same time he received his characteristic scar.

  Those who have caught a glimpse of Paakis-si report that the sasquatch appears extremely healthy and vital for a semicentennial, and whether he is actually a thousandyear- old nature spirit or just an unusually long-lived and wise sasquatch is left up to debate. Travelers passing near to or through the Churlwood often consider it a lucky omen to spot Paakis-si's signature footprints.

##### Description

Travelers passing by the Churlwood in Varisia might hear tales of a longlived _sasquatch_ who has inhabited the woods for almost 50 years now. Trackers recognize the _sasquatch_’s unique trail thanks to a birth defect that left the _sasquatch_ with a distinctive gait. Locals in the area refer to the _sasquatch_ by nicknames such as “Old Limpy,” but the Shoanti call the honored being _[[monsters/Paakis-Si|Paakis-si]]_.

Many among the Shoanti claim that _Paakis-si_ has lived for thousands of years. They poetically describe _Paakis-si_ as more nature spirit than living creature, a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Guardian|guardian]]_ of the woods who protects the natural creatures and punishes those who would seek to despoil the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sacred|sacred]]_ land. The scar that runs across his face and the soul-piercing _[[universal monster rules/Gaze|gaze]]_ of his cerulean eyes lends evidence to the Shoanti’s fables, and those who encounter the legendary _sasquatch_ know he is no ordinary member of his elusive species. The magical tree branch he wields as a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ _club_ lends further evidence to such claims, and many believe the ancient being found his weapon at the same time he received his characteristic scar.

Those who have caught a glimpse of _Paakis-si_ report that the _sasquatch_ appears extremely healthy and vital for a semicentennial, and whether he is actually a thousandyear- old nature spirit or just an unusually long-lived and wise _sasquatch_ is left up to debate. Travelers passing near to or through the Churlwood often consider it a _[[feats/Lucky|lucky]]_ omen to spot _Paakis-si_’s signature footprints.
