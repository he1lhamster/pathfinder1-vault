### Special Abilities

**Jagged Sting (Ex)** A _[[monsters/Water Leaper|water leaper]]_’s sting

causes dangerous shards

too tiny for the eye to

see to break off into the

target’s flesh and cause

bleeding. A successful

DC 15 _[[spells/Heal|Heal]]_ check stops

the bleeding and

removes the fragments.

However, magical and

supernatural healing of

any kind doesn’t stop the bleeding

and instead seals the fragments within

the wound, increasing the _bleed_ damage to

1d4 points and the _Heal_ DC to stop the bleeding to 20. Further

such healing still doesn’t stop the _bleed_ effect, but also

doesn’t increase the damage or _Heal_ DC further.

**Water Leap (Ex)** Water leapers get their name from their

uncanny ability to ambush prey by leaping out of the

water. A _water leaper_ that begins its turn in the water can

make a special leaping charge attack. This special charge

doesn’t need to be in a straight line with respect to altitude,

allowing the _water leaper_ to leap out, up and over the rim of

a boat, and down onto its prey. At the end of a water leap,

the _water leaper_ can make both a bite and a sting attack.

##### Description

Water leapers are ornery hunters that thrive in lakes,

swamps, and other marshy bodies of water. They eagerly

ambush much larger targets. Against challenging prey,

they make their namesake leap from the water, use their

jagged sting to open a wound, and then wait for their

victim to _bleed_ out. Although fishermen tell tales of

marauding water leapers, in reality, the creatures prefer

attacking animals and other less canny prey, since

intelligent creatures are both more likely to be able to

halt the bleeding from the _water leaper_’s sting and hold a

grudge afterward.

The average _water leaper_ is a little over 3 feet long, not

counting its wings or the length of its tail, and weighs

between 8 and 16 pounds.
