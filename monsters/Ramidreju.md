### Special Abilities

**Pit Digger (Ex)** A _[[monsters/Ramidreju|ramidreju]]_ can dig a 20-foot-deep pit in

normal ground or soft earth (not solid stone) and cover it

with branches, grass, and twigs. This pit is identical to a

CR 1 pit trap. It takes

a _ramidreju_ 4 hours to dig a pit, though the creature is not

required to complete all the digging in the same day.
**Smell Gold (Ex)** A _ramidreju_ can use its _scent_ ability to

detect and pinpoint the location of gold within 90 feet.

The _ramidreju_ can smell buried gold, gold held inside a

container (like a backpack or treasure chest), or even gold

deposits inside solid rock. The _ramidreju_ knows neither the

amount of gold nor if the gold is carried or guarded by

a trap or creature.

##### Description

Ramidrejus are snake-bodied weasels with a

talent for digging pit traps and sniffing out gold.

Most ramidrejus have green fur, often patterned

with darker and lighter _[[spells/Shades|shades]]_ of green and

brown suggestive of a poisonous snake’s

scales. Though not venomous, ramidrejus

are fully capable of crushing small prey or biting and

draining the blood from larger foes.

Ramidrejus are sometimes born into the litters of

normal or giant weasel families who live near wild areas

touched by fey magic. Belligerent and feisty, they are

usually killed or driven off by their birth mothers, who

are unnerved by their otherworldly nature. Ramidrejus

that survive their infancy grow quickly to adulthood in the

space of a week and live solitary lives sometimes lasting

300 years or more.

Due to their fey inf luence, all ramidrejus instinctively

understand a small amount of Sylvan and can respond

through facial expressions or tapping their feet, if not

actual words.

Ramidrejus are unnaturally attracted to gold and often

decorate their burrows with gold nuggets, gold coins,

and stolen gold _[[items/Mundane/Jewelry|jewelry]]_, which they protect with a savage

_[[universal monster rules/Ferocity|ferocity]]_. Unscrupulous gold miners have been known to

capture ramidrejus and force them to sniff out and dig up

caches of gold, though the creatures’ unpredictable tempers

often cause this arrangement to end in bloodshed. Kinder

souls who bribe a _ramidreju_ with gold rather than force

it into captivity find that the creatures will occasionally

form a powerful lifelong friendship with such a benefactor,

though the _ramidreju_’s desire for gold can mean that its

ally makes little profit from this arrangement.

Ramidrejus average around 5-1/2 feet in length and

weigh 100 pounds.
