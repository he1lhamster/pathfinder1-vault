desc_short: Like a living volcanic eruption, the sheer massiveness of this titan defies
  all reason. Monstrously shaped in part like a gigantic, terrible centipede and in
  part like some primeval, wingless dragon, this living holocaust is completely armored
  over in plates of angry, obsidian-sharp magma. Two massive claws like insectile
  scythes sheer before the burning terror as is skitters forth in rapid bursts of

special_abilities:
  Blindsight (Ex): Xotani can “see” by emitting highfrequency sounds, inaudible to
    most other creatures, that allow it to ascertain objects and creatures within
    120 feet. A silence spell negates this ability, but its other forms of vision
    prevent it from being utterly blinded.
  Breath Weapon (Su): 70-foot cone, once every 1d4 rounds, damage 16d10 fire, Reflex
    DC 43 half. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Firebleed (Ex): As a creature of living fire and wrath, Xotani ferociously strikes
    back against any creature that wounds it. Any attack that does more than 10 points
    of damage to Xotani causes the wound to erupt in a 30-foot cone of magma. This
    cone deals 1d6 points of fire damage plus an additional 1d6 points of fire damage
    for every 10 points of damage dealt by the attack. Thus, an attack dealing 22
    points of damage results in a cone dealing 3d6 points of fire damage, while an
    attack dealing 49 points of damage results in a cone dealing 5d6 points of fire
    damage. Creatures affected by the cone may make a DC 43 Reflex save to take only
    half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. Ranged attacks and any magical
    attacks that deal damage also cause this special ability to take effect. Xotani
    cannot firebleed at will, but might do so 10 times per round (an amount equal
    to its Constitution modifier).
  Frightful Presence (Su): Xotani can inspire terror by attacking. Affected creatures
    must succeed on a DC 35 Will save or become shaken, remaining in that condition
    as long as they remain within 60 feet of Xotani. This is a mind-affecting fear
    effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Heat (Ex): Xotani generates so much heat that its mere touch deals additional 4d8
    points of fire damage. Creatures striking Xotani with natural attacks or unarmed
    attacks are subject to this damage, but creatures striking with melee weapons
    do not take damage from its heat. This heat can melt or char weapons; any weapon
    that strikes Xotani is allowed a DC 43 Fortitude save to avoid destruction. The
    save DC is Constitution-based.
  Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, Xotani must hit a Huge or smaller opponent
    with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
    without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes
    a hold and can try to swallow the foe the following round.
  Regeneration (Ex): |-
    No form of attack deals lethal damage to Xotani. Xotani regenerates even if it fails a saving throw against a disintegrate spell or a death effect. If Xotani fails its save against a spell or effect that would kill it instantly (such as those mentioned above), the spell or effect instead deals nonlethal damage equal to the creature's full normal hit points +10 (or 738 hp). Xotani is immune to effects that produce incurable or bleeding wounds, such as mummy rot, a sword with the wounding special ability, or a clay golem's cursed wound ability.

    Xotani can be slain only by raising its nonlethal damage total to its full normal hit points +10 (or 738 hit points), at least half of which must be inflicted by cold damage, and using a wish or miracle spell to keep it dead.

    If Xotani loses a limb or body part, the lost portion regrows in 1d6 minutes (the detached piece dies and decays normally). Xotani can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to the stump.
  Sunlight Blindness (Ex): Abrupt exposure to sunlight (such as sunlight, but not
    a daylight spell) blinds Xotani for 1 round. On subsequent rounds, it is dazzled
    while operating in direct sunlight.
  Swallow Whole (Ex): When Xotani begins its turn with a grappled opponent in its
    mouth, it can swallow that opponent whole with a successful grapple check. Once
    inside Xotani, the opponent takes 2d8+7 points of bludgeoning damage plus 20d6
    points of fire damage per round from being submerged in the magma pool that is
    Xotani's stomach. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing
    or piercing weapon to deal 50 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 25). Once the
    creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must
    cut its own way out. Xotani's gullet can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium, 128
    Small, or 512 Tiny or smaller creatures.
  Trample (Ex): Reflex DC 47 half. The save DC is Strength-based.
desc_long: |-
  A being of living flame and magma, crawled from the depths of Golarion and the prison of the caged god of destruction, Xotani the Firebleeder is one of the unfathomable monstrosities known and feared as the Spawn of Rovagug. A creature born of rage within the unfathomable depths of the world, it is a creature of pure devastation and hottest flames knowing only wrath, fire, and the harsh stone of the realms below. The surface world is pain to Xotani, especially the cursed sun, from which it retreats by day. By night, however, it bursts from the depths, preceded by sweeping firestorms and deadly claws and followed by a trail like a burnt pyre, all charred ruins and smoking corpses. It is rumored that vast tunnel systems melted into the earth by the passage of the Firebleeder spiderweb the lands of northeastern Garund-the region most devastated by Xotani's rampages-to modern times, immense subterranean corridors that still burn with the Spawn of Rovagug's passage.

  Like the majority of Rovagug's ruinous children, Xotani is wrath and devastation given life. It has no desires or intentions beyond destroying all that crosses its path and consuming the ashes. All the life, growth, and creations of the surface worlds are anathema to the living holocaust, which takes some measure of primal satisfaction in crushing the charred remains of such order, yet finds itself endlessly frustrated and incensed by the openness of the surface, the tepid storms and weak rages of weather, and the endless number of wet, hollowing things that fall in its wake. It makes no distinction between the servants of its terrible parent and all the other pathetic things of the lands above, burning and devouring all, caring nothing for whether its living tinder sees its flames as blessing or damnation.

  Numerous attempts were made to slay the Firebleeder before its rampage finally came to an end. Through innate cunning and unstoppable profane determination, the titanic abomination survived numerous and varied attempts to lay it low, including potent freezing magics, being magically dropped from an incredible height, and immersion in the Obari Ocean. Yet, despite its seemingly invincible form, Xotani was destroyed by an alliance of potent mages in 2104 ar, who, at the cost of untold lives, ended its rampage across northern Garund in the Brazen Peaks of western Katapesh. The remains of the Firebleeder's corpse lie in the volcanic caverns beneath the spire known as Pale Mountain-a peak said to take its color from the crushed bones of those who died battling the beast. Yet no terror as relentless as a Spawn of Rovagug ever truly dies, and there are those who would see the flames of Xotani rekindled to scour the dross of the world anew.

### Special Abilities

**_Blindsight_ (Ex)** Xotani can “see” by emitting highfrequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allow it to ascertain objects and creatures within 120 feet. A _[[spells/Silence|silence]]_ spell negates this ability, but its other forms of _[[spells/Vision|vision]]_ prevent it from being utterly _[[conditions/Blinded|blinded]]_.

**_Breath Weapon_ (Su)** 70-foot cone, once every 1d4 rounds, damage 16d10 fire, Reflex DC 43 half. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Firebleed (Ex)** As a creature of living fire and wrath, Xotani ferociously strikes back against any creature that wounds it. Any attack that does more than 10 points of damage to Xotani causes the wound to erupt in a 30-foot cone of magma. This cone deals 1d6 points of fire damage plus an additional 1d6 points of fire damage for every 10 points of damage dealt by the attack. Thus, an attack dealing 22 points of damage results in a cone dealing 3d6 points of fire damage, while an attack dealing 49 points of damage results in a cone dealing 5d6 points of fire damage. Creatures affected by the cone may make a DC 43 Reflex save to take only half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. Ranged attacks and any magical attacks that deal damage also cause this special ability to take effect. Xotani cannot firebleed at will, but might do so 10 times per round (an amount equal to its Constitution modifier).

**_Frightful Presence_ (Su)** Xotani can inspire terror by attacking. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 35 Will save or become _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_, remaining in that condition as long as they remain within 60 feet of Xotani. This is a mind-affecting _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**_Heat_ (Ex)** Xotani generates so much _heat_ that its mere touch deals additional 4d8 points of fire damage. Creatures striking Xotani with _[[universal monster rules/Natural Attacks|natural attacks]]_ or unarmed attacks are subject to this damage, but creatures striking with melee weapons do not take damage from its _heat_. This _heat_ can melt or char weapons; any weapon that strikes Xotani is allowed a DC 43 Fortitude save to avoid _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Improved _Grab_ (Ex)** To use this ability, Xotani must hit a Huge or smaller opponent with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow the foe the following round.

**_Regeneration_ (Ex)** No form of attack deals lethal damage to Xotani. Xotani regenerates even if it fails a saving throw against a _[[spells/Disintegrate|disintegrate]]_ spell or a death effect. If Xotani fails its save against a spell or effect that would kill it instantly (such as those mentioned above), the spell or effect instead deals nonlethal damage equal to the creature’s full normal hit points +10 (or 738 hp). Xotani is immune to effects that produce incurable or bleeding wounds, such as _[[curses/Mummy rot|mummy rot]]_, a sword with the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Wounding|wounding]]_ special ability, or a _[[items/Mundane/Clay|clay]]_ golem’s cursed wound ability.

Xotani can be slain only by raising its nonlethal damage total to its full normal hit points +10 (or 738 hit points), at least half of which must be inflicted by cold damage, and using a _wish_ or _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_ spell to keep it dead.

If Xotani loses a limb or body part, the lost portion regrows in 1d6 minutes (the detached piece dies and decays normally). Xotani can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to the stump.
**Sunlight Blindness (Ex)** Abrupt exposure to sunlight (such as sunlight, but not a _[[spells/Daylight|daylight]]_ spell) blinds Xotani for 1 round. On subsequent rounds, it is _[[conditions/Dazzled|dazzled]]_ while operating in direct sunlight.
**_Swallow Whole_ (Ex)** When Xotani begins its turn with a _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ opponent in its mouth, it can swallow that opponent whole with a successful grapple check. Once inside Xotani, the opponent takes 2d8+7 points of bludgeoning damage plus 20d6 points of fire damage per round from being submerged in the magma pool that is Xotani’s stomach. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 50 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 25). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out.

##### Description

A being of living flame and magma, crawled from the depths of Golarion and the prison of the caged god of _destruction_, Xotani the Firebleeder is one of the unfathomable monstrosities known and feared as the Spawn of Rovagug. A creature born of _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ within the unfathomable depths of the world, it is a creature of pure devastation and hottest flames knowing only wrath, fire, and the harsh stone of the realms below. The surface world is pain to Xotani, especially the cursed sun, from which it retreats by day. By night, however, it bursts from the depths, preceded by sweeping firestorms and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ claws and followed by a trail like a burnt pyre, all charred ruins and smoking corpses. It is rumored that vast tunnel systems melted into the earth by the passage of the Firebleeder spiderweb the lands of northeastern Garund—the region most devastated by Xotani’s rampages—to modern times, immense subterranean corridors that still _[[universal monster rules/Burn|burn]]_ with the Spawn of Rovagug’s passage.

Like the majority of Rovagug’s ruinous children, Xotani is wrath and devastation given life. It has no desires or intentions beyond destroying all that crosses its path and consuming the ashes. All the life, growth, and creations of the surface worlds are anathema to the living holocaust, which takes some measure of primal satisfaction in crushing the charred remains of such order, yet finds itself endlessly frustrated and incensed by the openness of the surface, the tepid storms and weak rages of weather, and the endless number of wet, hollowing things that fall in its wake. It makes no distinction between the servants of its terrible parent and all the other pathetic things of the lands above, _burning_ and devouring all, caring nothing for whether its living tinder sees its flames as blessing or _[[spells/Damnation|damnation]]_.

Numerous attempts were made to slay the Firebleeder before its rampage finally came to an end. Through innate _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cunning|cunning]]_ and unstoppable profane _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Determination|determination]]_, the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Titanic|titanic]]_ abomination survived numerous and varied attempts to lay it low, including _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ freezing magics, being magically dropped from an incredible height, and immersion in the Obari Ocean. Yet, despite its seemingly invincible form, Xotani was destroyed by an alliance of _potent_ mages in 2104 ar, who, at the cost of untold lives, ended its rampage across northern Garund in the Brazen Peaks of western Katapesh.
