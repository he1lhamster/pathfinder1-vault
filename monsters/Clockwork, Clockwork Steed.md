    this combat maneuver check.
desc_long: These tireless constructs were designed by engineers as a replacement for
  normal horses. They can gallop ceaselessly for hours or even days if required. In
  addition to their endurance, clockwork steeds pack a powerful physical punch-blows
  from their hooves can send smaller creatures flying. Though many riders enjoy the
  unquestioning way that clockwork steeds accept commands from their riders, others
  find these steeds' lack of personality frustrating. Unlike normal horses, a clockwork
  steed lacks the ability to create a bond with its rider.
