  Fate Drain (Su): A theletos possesses a pair of flexible crystalline tentacles with
    which it can drain a creature's sense of fate and destiny. Whenever it strikes
    a foe with these tentacles, the creature struck must make a DC 17 Will save or
    take 1d4 points of Charisma damage. Until a creature's Charisma damage from this
    ability is healed, the victim takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws (regardless
    of the actual total amount of Charisma damage it takes). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Wreath of Fate (Su): As a full-round-action every 1d4 rounds, a theletos can release
    a 60-foot cone of energy from its chest. Any intelligent creature struck by this
    cone must make a DC 15 Will save or become nearly overwhelmed with the knowledge
    of various fates that destiny has in store for him-there is no way to make sense
    of these myriad dooms and boons, and as a result, the victim is staggered. As
    long as this condition persists, the victim may choose to make two rolls when
    attempting an attack roll, a saving throw, or a skill check-he must accept the
    worse of the two rolls, but in so doing the wreath of fate passes from his soul
    and he is no longer staggered by this ability. Wreath of fate is a curse effect,
    and as such can be affected by remove curse or break enchantment-the effective
    caster level of this curse is equal to the theletos's HD (CL 9th in most cases).
    The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  The strange theletos is the guardian of the duality between freedom and fate. Slavery is no more of an issue to a theletos than is true freedom, but without one, the other cannot exist. In areas where slavery is rife, a theletos might aid in freeing some slaves, while in regions where slavery has been abolished, this strange being works to subjugate many creatures with its own mind-controlling spell-like abilities-often encouraging them to further undertake acts of slavery themselves. The theletos is also a guardian of fate and prophecy, and while for some creatures it might allow glimpses of futures, others who peer into the future almost seem to cause the aeon physical pain. The theletos cannot explain why one seer might be allowed to divine futures while another should not-it knows only that some prophets should be denied this pursuit. 

  A theletos is 5 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.

##### Description

The strange theletos is the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Guardian|guardian]]_ of the duality between _[[spells/Freedom|freedom]]_ and fate. Slavery is no more of an issue to a theletos than is true _freedom_, but without one, the other cannot exist. In areas where slavery is rife, a theletos might aid in freeing some slaves, while in regions where slavery has been abolished, this strange being works to subjugate many creatures with its own mind-controlling _spell-like abilities_—often encouraging them to further undertake acts of slavery themselves. The theletos is also a _guardian_ of fate and prophecy, and while for some creatures it might allow glimpses of futures, others who peer into the future almost seem to cause the aeon physical pain. The theletos cannot explain why one seer might be allowed to divine futures while another should not—it knows only that some prophets should be denied this pursuit.

A theletos is 5 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.
