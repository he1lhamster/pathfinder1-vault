  Bladed Slam (Ex): The First Blade's slam attacks deal bludgeoning and slashing damage.
    Its slams count as natural weapons or manufactured weapons (whichever is most
    beneficial to it) for the purpose of spells that enhance attacks, and as adamantine,
    chaotic, and magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing
    hardness.
  Ironsense (Ex): The First Blade automatically detects iron objects within 60 feet,
    just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.
  Immunity to Magic (Su): The First Blade has the same immunity to magic as an iron
    golem. It can lower this resistance for 1 round as a standard action.
  Lord of Battle (Ex): The First Blade is proficient in all weapons, and counts as
    an 18th-level barbarian and fighter for the purposes of all prerequisites.
  Rage Aura (Su): Willing creatures within 100 feet of the First Blade gain the effects
    of rage automatically, whether they are allies or enemies of the herald. Those
    who choose not to be affected are immune to the aura until they leave the area
    and return.
  Swarm Form (Su): The herald can transform into a floating swarm of Tiny sharp metal
    fragments. In this form it has the swarm subtype, cannot make slam attacks, gains
    the distraction ability (DC 28), and can make a swarm attack that deals 4d6 points
    of slashing damage to its targets.
desc_long: |-
  Said to have been formed from an unthinking sliver of steel dashed from Gorum's blade during one of his violent clashes with a god-beast felled long ago, the First Blade is a living tool of war. Inspired by Gorum's divine bloodlust, the First Blade continues to do battle in the service of its divine master. It has been reforged through the eons into a manifestation of Gorum's perfect warrior, and now serves as the war god's herald, traveling where its master desires. The herald answers only the calls of those who please Gorum in battle-weakling priests who beg for salvation from deadly foes never have their entreaties answered. Tales tell of the herald appearing amid lesser battles and, upon finding them to be mere skirmishes or clashes among weaklings, slaughtering all involved in disgust.

  The appearance of the First Blade transforms to match a style of armor that's impressive to those it will be facing in battle. Regardless of its form, it typically stands about 15 feet tall and weighs nearly 5 tons.

##### Description

Said to have been formed from an unthinking sliver of steel dashed from Gorum’s blade during one of his violent clashes with a god-beast felled long ago, the First Blade is a living tool of war. _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Inspired|Inspired]]_ by Gorum’s divine bloodlust, the First Blade continues to do battle in the service of its divine master. It has been reforged through the eons into a manifestation of Gorum’s perfect warrior, and now serves as the war god’s herald, traveling where its master desires. The herald answers only the calls of those who please Gorum in battle—weakling priests who beg for salvation from _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ foes never have their entreaties answered. Tales tell of the herald appearing amid lesser battles and, upon finding them to be mere skirmishes or clashes among weaklings, slaughtering all involved in disgust.

The appearance of the First Blade transforms to match a style of armor that’s impressive to those it will be facing in battle. Regardless of its form, it typically stands about 15 feet tall and weighs nearly 5 tons.
