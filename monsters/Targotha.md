special_abilities:
  Jolt (Ex): A targotha stores electrical potential that it can expend as a ranged
    touch attack with a range of 240 feet. Using this ability within oil or tar reduces
    its range to 30 feet. A targotha can't use this ability in water. A jolt deals
    12d6 points of electricity damage, and the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude
    DC 28 negates the stun effect). It can use this ability once every 1d4+1 rounds.
    The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Razor Fins (Ex): A targotha's razor fins are a primary attack that deal slashing
    damage and threaten a critical hit on a 19 or 20, augmented to 17-20 by its Improved
    Critical feat.
  Slippery (Ex): A targotha secretes a thick mucus that allows it to move gracefully
    through viscous fluids like tar and oil. This mucus dissolves away adhesives (such
    as sovereign glue, tanglefoot bags, and webs) in 1d4 rounds. Additionally, all
    combat maneuver checks to grapple a targotha automatically fail, and the targotha
    automatically succeeds at any combat maneuver checks and Escape Artist checks
    to escape a grapple or a pin.
  Tail Slap (Ex): A targotha adds 1-1/2 × its Strength modifier to damage rolls for
    its tail slap. A targotha can attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check against
    a creature struck by its tail slap as a free action without provoking attacks
    of opportunity. The targotha can't move as part of this bull rush.
  Volatile Breath (Ex): A targotha can breathe a 60-foot cone of flammable gas as
    a breath weapon. As a swift action, it can ignite the gas by using its jolt ability.
    When ignited, the gas explodes, dealing 15d6 points of fire damage to all creatures
    in the area (Reflex DC 23 half). If not ignited, the gas lingers in the area until
    dissipating at the start of the targotha's next turn. All creatures that breathe
    this gas in are confused for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude DC 23 negates). The save DCs
    are Constitution-based and have a -5 racial penalty.
desc_long: |-
  Targothas are unusual creatures that thrive in the thick, inky fluids of naturally occurring tar seeps or pits of oil, although they are equally at home in swampy waters or muddy bogs. They depend upon their blindsense when lurking within opaque fluids like tar or ooze, and will even lurch out of their lairs and flop along the ground if necessary to pursue a meal. A targotha is a patient ambush predator, and without the need to breathe, it can lie in wait for weeks for food. 

  A typical targotha measures 30 feet in length and weighs 7,000 pounds. Larger specimens are known to exist, but they prefer to dwell far from areas inhabited by civilized folk in the largest and deepest of tar pits or fens. Truly enormous targothas have multiple sets of razor fins and are capable of making two, three, or even four devastating attacks with their fins in a round.
