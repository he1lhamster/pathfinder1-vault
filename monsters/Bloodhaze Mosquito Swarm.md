  Cling (Ex): If a creature leaves a bloodhaze mosquito swarm's square, the swarm

    A creature with bloodhaze mosquitoes clinging to it takes 1 point of Constitution
    damage at the end of its turn for the next 1d4 rounds. As a full-round action,
    the creature can remove the mosquitoes with a DC 18 Reflex save or by immersing
    itself in water. High winds or any amount of damage from an area-affecting effect
    destroys all clinging mosquitoes. The save DC is Dexterity-based. Once a group
    of clinging mosquitoes has dealt 4 points of Constitution damage, the mosquitoes
    detach and disperse to digest their meal.
  Disease (Ex): |-
    Bloodhaze mosquitoes are bearers of a terrifying and deadly disease common to the jungle, known to most locals as sleeping sickness.

    Sleeping Sickness: Swarm-injury; save Fort DC 17; onset 1d2 days; frequency 1 day; effect 1d4 Wisdom damage and target is fatigued, cure 2 consecutive saves or arsenic (see page 85 for more details).

  Thousands of species of insects make their home within the shelter of the Mwangi Expanse, but few elicit as much dread as the voracious bloodhaze mosquito. Migratory in nature, these ravenous insects amass in great numbers, forming swarms capable of feasting on the blood of humanoids and beasts alike. Perhaps worse, the crimson parasites carry a debilitating disease known for sapping the vitality of its victims. Because of this potent mix of teeming esurience and virulent pestilence, bloodhaze mosquitoes panic almost any community they threaten. Legends describe crimson clouds decimating entire populations on their flight from breeding pool to jungle interior. Only high winds, drought, and torrential rain consistently keep them at bay. Thankfully, the swarms also wax and wane with fluctuations in local prey populations. In combination with the mosquitoes' relatively short lifespan, competition for food helps keep their numbers under marginal control.

  A typical bloodhaze swarm contains more than 10,000 flying mosquitoes. Individually, each mosquito is smaller than a child's fingernail, yet together they form a terrifying assault. Their iridescent wings can refract light, creating a shimmering effect as they move in unison. This effect proves disconcerting to most animals, which wisely flee such clouds, their panic often alerting other jungle inhabitants to the swarm's presence.

##### Description

Thousands of species of insects make their home within the shelter of the Mwangi Expanse, but few elicit as much dread as the voracious bloodhaze mosquito. Migratory in nature, these _[[curses/Ravenous|ravenous]]_ insects amass in great numbers, forming swarms capable of feasting on the blood of humanoids and beasts alike. Perhaps worse, the crimson parasites carry a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Debilitating|debilitating]]_ disease known for _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sapping|sapping]]_ the vitality of its victims. Because of this _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ mix of teeming esurience and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Virulent|virulent]]_ pestilence, bloodhaze mosquitoes panic almost any community they threaten. Legends describe crimson clouds decimating entire populations on their _[[universal monster rules/Flight|flight]]_ from breeding pool to jungle interior. Only high winds, drought, and torrential rain consistently keep them at bay. Thankfully, the swarms also wax and wane with fluctuations in local prey populations. In combination with the mosquitoes’ relatively short lifespan, competition for food helps keep their numbers under marginal control.

A typical bloodhaze swarm contains more than 10,000 flying mosquitoes. Individually, each mosquito is smaller than a child's fingernail, yet together they form a _[[feats/Terrifying Assault|terrifying assault]]_. Their iridescent wings can refract light, creating a shimmering effect as they move in unison. This effect proves disconcerting to most animals, which wisely flee such clouds, their panic often alerting other jungle inhabitants to the swarm’s presence.
