# Qlippoth, Utukku
Wriggling tendrils surround this creature’s single eye where a face

should be, and sucker-tipped tentacles stretch from its shoulders.

### Special Abilities

**Consume Humanity (Su)** When an utukku hits a humanoid with a slam attack, it siphons away some of that creature’s humanity, leaving its victim warped and deformed. The victim must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Charisma drain. An utukku can consume humanity as a touch attack instead. It can use _change shape_ only to assume the appearance of the last humanoid it used this ability on. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**False _Prophet_ (Su)** An utukku gains access to the granted powers of two domains as per a _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ of a level equal to its CR (8th level for the typical utukku), chosen from among the following: Community, Healing, Nobility, Protection, or Repose. Some utukku may have access to different domains.

**Horrific Appearance (Su)** Creatures that succumb to an utukku’s horrific appearance are _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1d4 rounds.

##### Description

The utukku specializes in a viciously subtle method of removing sinful souls from the cycle of mortal life. When an utukku builds a cult, it teaches its followers that if they follow its teachings, they will be rewarded not via _[[spells/Transformation|transformation]]_ into a powerful outsider, but by assimilation into the Great Beyond itself. What greater glory than to be immortal as a fundamental part of reality? The souls of devout utukku cultists, as wicked and destructive as they were in life, do not transform into outsiders upon being judged, but instead form into new _[[spells/Quintessence|quintessence]]_ that then merges with the Abyss. In this way, these souls bolster the Abyss while simultaneously starving demonkind of the new souls they need to grow in number.

In its true shape, an utukku stands 7 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.
