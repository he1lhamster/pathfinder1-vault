  Inhale Flames (Ex): As a standard action, a chimney troll can inhale a single nonmagical
    fire up to the size of a campfire within 30 feet. This extinguishes the fire and
    grants the chimney troll regeneration 3 (acid, cold) for 3 rounds. If the fire
    is attended (such as fire on a held torch), a successful DC 13 Reflex save negates
    this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Soot Breath (Su): As a standard action, a chimney troll can exhale a searing cloud
    of smoke and cinders that fills the lungs of a targeted creature within 30 feet.
    The victim takes 1d6 points of fire damage and becomes nauseated for 1d3 rounds.
    A successful DC 13 Fortitude save halves the fire damage taken and negates the
    nausea effect. This ability can be used once each time the chimney troll inhales
    flames and only within 3 rounds of using that ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Wicked Blood (Ex): Chimney trolls cannot heal hit point damage naturally (such as
    by resting).
desc_long: |-
  Chimney trolls are gaunt, pale giants that skulk among the shadowy rooftops of towns and cities, searching for flames to heal their cursed wounds and flesh to sate their bellies. To claim the fire they need to survive, they twist their limbs into impossible positions, hiding in chimneys and sucking up the flames from frightened townsfolk's hearths.

  By some cruel twist of fate or malicious necromancy, chimney trolls' accursed bodies can heal wounds only if they consume the very substance trolls loathe most: fire. This desperate reliance on fire has made them anathema to their kin, who long ago drove them from their mountain homes and into civilized lands.

  Chimney trolls are 9 feet tall and weigh 350 pounds.

##### Description

Chimney trolls are gaunt, pale giants that _[[monsters/Skulk|skulk]]_ among the shadowy rooftops of towns and cities, searching for flames to _heal_ their cursed wounds and flesh to sate their bellies. To claim the fire they need to survive, they twist their limbs into impossible positions, hiding in chimneys and sucking up the flames from _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_ townsfolk’s hearths.

By some _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_ twist of fate or malicious necromancy, chimney trolls’ _[[feats/Accursed|accursed]]_ bodies can _heal_ wounds only if they consume the very substance trolls loathe most: fire. This desperate reliance on fire has made them anathema to their kin, who long ago drove them from their mountain homes and into civilized lands.

Chimney trolls are 9 feet tall and weigh 350 pounds.
