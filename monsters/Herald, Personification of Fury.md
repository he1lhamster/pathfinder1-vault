  Drench (Ex): The herald's touch puts out Huge or smaller nonmagical flames. The
    herald can dispel magical fire it touches as dispel magic (caster level 19th).
  Energy Ray (Ex): The herald can shoot rays of cold or electricity up to 100 feet.
    These can threaten a critical hit on a roll of 18, 19, or 20.
  Vortex (Su): The herald can create a whirlpool at will as a standard action. This
    ability functions identically to its whirlwind special attack, but can only form
    underwater and cannot leave the water.
  Water Mastery (Ex): The herald gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both
    it and its opponent are touching water. These modifiers apply to bull rush and
    overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds
    of attacks. (Unlike a water elemental, the herald does not have a penalty if it
    or its opponent is touching the ground.)
desc_long: |-
  Gozreh's herald, Personification of Fury, is a living elemental storm of air and water. It may once have been an actual storm given independent life and intelligence, but it does not remember anything before awakening in the service of Gozreh. Its powers allow it to shift itself fully into air or water or even to assume the form of a beast, though it is most comfortable in its dual-material elemental shape. As a living storm, the herald can provide life-sustaining water, whisk others to safety, save mortals from drowning, or rain down watery death upon the enemies of Gozreh. It is comfortable doing any of these things, and has no objection to taking lives- even innocent lives, if this serves the will of Gozreh. With Gozreh's permission, it sometimes acts as an intermediary between rival elemental forces.

  The Herald of Gozreh rises to nearly 25 feet in height, and its changeable form usually weighs approximately 1 ton.

##### Description

Gozreh’s _[[monsters/Herald, Personification of Fury|herald, Personification of Fury]]_, is a living elemental storm of air and water. It may once have been an actual storm given independent life and intelligence, but it does not remember anything before awakening in the service of Gozreh. Its powers allow it to shift itself fully into air or water or even to assume the form of a beast, though it is most comfortable in its dual-material elemental shape. As a living storm, the herald can provide life-sustaining water, whisk others to safety, save mortals from drowning, or rain down watery death upon the enemies of Gozreh. It is comfortable doing any of these things, and has no objection to taking lives— even innocent lives, if this serves the will of Gozreh. With Gozreh’s permission, it sometimes acts as an intermediary between _[[feats/Rival|rival]]_ elemental forces.

The Herald of Gozreh rises to nearly 25 feet in height, and its changeable form usually weighs approximately 1 ton.
