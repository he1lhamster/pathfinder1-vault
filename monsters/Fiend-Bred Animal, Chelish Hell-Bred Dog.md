  Hot Climate Adaptation (Ex): A Chelish hell-bred dog gains a +8 racial bonus on
    Fortitude saves to avoid nonlethal damage from very hot environmental conditions.
  Sulfurous Spittle (Ex): Once per hour as a standard action, a Chelish hell-bred
    dog can spray a 10-foot cone of sulfurous liquid from its mouth. Any creature
    caught in the cone is nauseated for 1 round and then sickened for 1d4 rounds.
    A successful DC 13 Fortitude save negates the nauseated effect and reduces the
    sickened effect to 1 round. A creature cannot use the scent ability as long as
    the sulfurous spray affects it. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
