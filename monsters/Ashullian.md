  Bower (Su): By spending 1 hour in intense concentration, an ashullian can designate
    a 50-foot-radius area within 200 feet as its bower. An ashullian's senses permeate
    its bower, allowing it to perceive the entire area with its blindsight and to
    touch, taste, smell, and hear everything within it. An ashullian always has line
    of effect to any area of its bower, and can cause any of its spell-like or supernatural
    abilities to originate from any point within its bower instead of from its own
    space. While inside its bower, the ashullian can use its telekinesis and major
    creation spell-like abilities at will to affect any creatures and objects located
    within. The ashullian's bower remains in place until the ashullian dies, moves
    more than 200 feet from the bower, or creates a new bower. A dispel magic spell
    or effect cannot dispel an ashullian's bower, although it can suppress the bower
    as though it were a magic item.
  Powerful Tentacles (Ex): An ashullian treats its tentacle attacks as primary natural
    attacks.
  Synesthetic Masterpiece (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds, an ashullian can briefly channel
    its artistic mastery to flood its bower with an overwhelming multisensory experience.
    Non-ashullians within its bower must each succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude saving
    throw or take 5d8 points of sonic damage and be staggered for 1 round, and must
    also succeed at a DC 20 Will save or take 5d8 points of damage and be fascinated
    for 1 round (during this round, the creature does not view anything within the
    bower that does not attack the affected creature as a potential threat). A creature
    that fails both saving throws is stunned for 1d4 rounds, rather than staggered
    or fascinated for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  Blind, contemplative artists from the lightless depths of the Elemental Plane of Water, ashullians coaxed sounds, tastes, and other diverse stimuli into miles-wide galleries among the plane's freezing currents. A powerful race of subterranean humanoids beneath Kaer Maga coveted the ashullians' abilities and tore open a planar rift that captured several ashullians but also flooded the humanoids' underground chambers with icy water. The humanoids vanished, and their ashullian prisoners now haunt the Kaer Magan caves known as the Drowned Levels. For generations, these creatures have prowled the chambers of their vanished captors. Ashullians seek objects that realize their eclectic and unpredictable aesthetic sense and showcase whatever oddities they find-which could include anything from a sodden scroll or a jeweled brooch to a severed foot-by wearing them in their flesh or displaying them in their magical bowers.

   Ashullians are not inherently aggressive, but they demand that strangers contribute curios for their art. An ashullian's sense of a “curio” is utterly alien to most creatures, and can range from a bauble or scarf to a moist lump of bread or a long strip of newly flayed skin. Denying an ashullian is likely to provoke its rage.

   A typical ashullian's lithe form measures 16 feet from head to tails and weighs only 200 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**Bower (Su)** By spending 1 hour in intense concentration, an _[[monsters/Ashullian|ashullian]]_ can designate a 50-foot-radius area within 200 feet as its bower. An _ashullian_’s senses permeate its bower, allowing it to perceive the entire area with its _blindsight_ and to touch, taste, smell, and hear everything within it. An _ashullian_ always has line of effect to any area of its bower, and can cause any of its spell-like or supernatural abilities to originate from any point within its bower instead of from its own space. While inside its bower, the _ashullian_ can use its _telekinesis_ and _major creation_ _spell-like abilities_ at will to affect any creatures and objects located within. The _ashullian_’s bower remains in place until the _ashullian_ dies, moves more than 200 feet from the bower, or creates a new bower. A _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ spell or effect cannot dispel an _ashullian_’s bower, although it can suppress the bower as though it were a magic item.

**Powerful Tentacles (Ex)** An _ashullian_ treats its tentacle attacks as primary _[[universal monster rules/Natural Attacks|natural attacks]]_.
**Synesthetic Masterpiece (Su)** Once every 1d4 rounds, an _ashullian_ can briefly channel its artistic mastery to flood its bower with an overwhelming multisensory experience. Non-ashullians within its bower must each succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or take 5d8 points of sonic damage and be _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1 round, and must also succeed at a DC 20 Will save or take 5d8 points of damage and be _[[conditions/Fascinated|fascinated]]_ for 1 round (during this round, the creature does not view anything within the bower that does not attack the affected creature as a potential threat). A creature that fails both saving throws is _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_ for 1d4 rounds, rather than _staggered_ or _fascinated_ for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.

##### Description

Blind, _[[monsters/Contemplative|contemplative]]_ artists from the lightless depths of the Elemental Plane of Water, ashullians coaxed sounds, tastes, and other diverse stimuli into miles-wide galleries among the plane’s freezing currents. A powerful race of subterranean humanoids beneath Kaer Maga coveted the ashullians’ abilities and tore open a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Planar|planar]]_ rift that captured several ashullians but also flooded the humanoids’ underground chambers with icy water. The humanoids vanished, and their _ashullian_ prisoners now haunt the Kaer Magan caves known as the Drowned Levels. For generations, these creatures have prowled the chambers of their vanished captors. Ashullians seek objects that realize their _[[feats/Eclectic|eclectic]]_ and unpredictable aesthetic sense and showcase whatever oddities they find—which could include anything from a sodden scroll or a jeweled _[[items/Mundane/Brooch|brooch]]_ to a severed foot—by wearing them in their flesh or displaying them in their magical bowers.

Ashullians are not inherently aggressive, but they _[[spells/Demand|demand]]_ that strangers contribute curios for their art. An _ashullian_’s sense of a “curio” is utterly alien to most creatures, and can range from a bauble or _[[items/Mundane/Scarf|scarf]]_ to a moist lump of bread or a long strip of newly flayed skin. _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Denying|Denying]]_ an _ashullian_ is likely to provoke its _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_.

A typical _ashullian_’s lithe form measures 16 feet from head to tails and weighs only 200 pounds.
