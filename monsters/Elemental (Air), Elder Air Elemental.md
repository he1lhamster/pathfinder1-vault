special_abilities:
  Air Mastery (Ex): Airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls
    against a mythic air elemental.
  Create Vacuum (Ex): As a standard action, a mythic elder air elemental can suck
    the air out of the lungs of creatures it has swallowed or that are trapped in
    its whirlwind (Fortitude DC 27 negates). Creatures that fail the save take 2d6
    points of damage and must attempt Constitution checks each round as if they had
    run out of breath. An affected character can't speak, use breath weapons, cast
    spells with verbal components, or do anything else that requires breathing. A
    trapped creature that succeeds at its save must succeed at a concentration check
    to cast spells. The air elemental can maintain this vacuum as a move action. If
    it stops, the trapped or swallowed creatures can breathe again. The save DC is
    Strength-based.
  Elevated Ejection (Ex): When a mythic air elemental in whirlwind form ejects a trapped
    creature, it can do so from any point up to the whirlwind's current height, dropping
    the creature into the whirlwind's space or within the elemental's normal reach.
    The creature takes falling damage as normal. If the elemental expends one use
    of mythic power, it can instead throw a trapped creature as if using the uncanny
    grapple path ability (see page 23) with no grapple check needed.
  Swallow Whole (Ex): A mythic air elemental can use this ability on a creature it
    has grabbed. If a trapped creature cuts itself free, the hole heals itself closed
    at the start of the elemental's next turn, allowing it to use swallow whole again.
desc_long: A mythic elder air elemental is pure fury and strength, capable of throwing
  wooden splinters through stone walls and tearing creatures apart with fists of solid
  wind. Its greatest speed is within its empty core, able to suffocate enemies in
  moments.

##### Ecology

**Environment** Plane of Air

Air elementals are fast, flying creatures made of living air. Primitive and territorial, they resent being summoned or doing the bidding of mortals, and much prefer to spend their time on the Plane of Air, swooping and racing through the endless skies.

Although all air elementals of a similar size have identical statistics, the exact appearance of an air elemental can vary wildly between individuals. One might be an _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Animated|animated]]_ _[[spells/Vortex|vortex]]_ of wind and smoke, while another might be a smoky bird-like creature with glowing eyes and wind for wings.

An air elemental prefers to attack flying or otherwise airbone targets, not only because its mastery over _[[universal monster rules/Flight|flight]]_ gives it a slight advantage, but also because it detests the thought of having to touch the ground. An air elemental can move _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_, and although it is an elemental and thus runs no risk of drowning, it has no ranks in Swim and loses much of its speed and _mobility_ when _underwater_.
