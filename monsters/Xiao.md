##### Description

These colorful winged monkeys sport tawny fur coats

ranging from blue-white to slate grey or even black, and some

individuals have much lighter white or ivory areas around

their faces and shoulders. Their wings tend to be brightly

feathered. Their faces, feet, and hands are always hairless, and

they _[[feats/Groom|groom]]_ the hair surrounding their faces outward, giving

them a tattered, bearded appearance. Xiaos have bodies about

15 inches long with equally long tails and a wingspan of about

three feet. A few individuals have two pairs of wings; this trait

grants them perfect maneuverability, but they are otherwise

statistically identical to their two-winged kin.

Xiaos are omnivores, eating fruit, nuts, insects, small

mammals, crabs, and fish. Given enough time, rather than

devouring their food raw, xiaos create elaborate dishes of

their favorite foods and cook these dishes over small fires,

which they light with their _spark_ spell-like ability. Xiaos also

enjoy trying new and exotic foods prepared by humanoid

creatures, especially foods made with f lour and sugar. Most

xiaos are very adventurous eaters, though they tend not to

like the taste of beef and lamb.

Xiaos build nests high up in the canopy of wild places

or thick forests, and often cluster their nests together

in groups of trees. They welcome small villages of

friendly humanoids within their territories, as such

creatures are a ready source of useful objects and

new forms of interesting food. _Xiao_ troops

often raid nearby civilized communities

for small amounts of salt and sugar, or

prepared foods for single meals, but do

not otherwise cause much mischief

unless provoked. Larger or hostile

communities that persecute or hunt

xiaos often suffer from numerous

unexpected fires and destructive

forms of larceny and sabotage.

Xiaos have excellent memories

and hold grudges against

those who abuse them.

While xiaos have very

few natural enemies,

they f lee from _[[monsters/Derhii|derhii]]_ on

sight. The enormous

winged gorillas are very

territorial and consider

xiaos to be pests. They

do not hesitate to

kill, skin, and eat xiaos,

and can eliminate a thriving _xiao_

community in a matter of hours.

Xiaos are born from eggs slightly

larger than a chicken egg. These eggs are covered with bluish

leathery skin, and are usually laid singly or, infrequently,

in pairs. A juvenile _xiao_ begins f lying within 6 weeks of

hatching, and hangs from the fur on its mother’s chest

until that time. Those born in captivity latch on to suitably

friendly and patient humanoids as surrogate mothers during

development. While a _xiao_ raised in captivity takes to f lying

later than those born in the wild, it otherwise develops

normally, though it is likely to have less _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ of strange

humans than its wild kin.

A spellcaster with the _[[feats/Improved Familiar|Improved Familiar]]_ feat and an arcane

caster level of 7th or higher can select a _xiao_ as her familiar.
