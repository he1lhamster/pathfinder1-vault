  Berserk (Ex): When a clay golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each
    round that its elemental spirit breaks free and the golem goes berserk. This chance
    resets to 0% after one minute of inactivity. A berserk golem attacks the nearest
    living creature or smashes some object smaller than itself if no creature is within
    reach. Once it goes berserk, no known method can reestablish control.
  Cursed Wound (Ex): The damage a clay golem deals doesn't heal naturally and resists
    magical healing. A character attempting to use magical healing on a creature damaged
    by a clay golem must succeed on a DC 26 caster level check, or the healing has
    no effect on the injured creature.
  Haste (Su): After it has engaged in at least 1 round of combat, a clay golem can
    haste itself once per day as a free action. The effect lasts 3 rounds and is otherwise
    the same as the spell.
  Immunity to Magic (Ex): A clay golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability
    that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
    differently against the creature, as noted below. A move earth spell drives the
    golem back 120 feet and deals 3d12 points of damage to it (no save).A disintegrate
    spell slows the golem (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d12 points
    of damage (no save).An earthquake spell cast directly at a clay golem stops it
    from moving on its next turn and deals 5d10 points of damage (no save).Any magical
    attack against a clay golem that deals acid damage heals 1 point of damage for
    every 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would
    cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary
    hit points. A clay golem gets no saving throw against magical attacks that deal
    acid damage.
desc_long: A clay golem wears no clothing except for a metal or stiff leather garment
  around its hips. It stands over 8 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds.

A character attempting to use magical healing on a creature damaged by a _clay_ golem must succeed on a DC 26 caster level check, or the healing has no effect on the injured creature.

**_Haste_ (Su) **After it has engaged in at least 1 round of combat, a _clay_ golem can _haste_ itself once per day as a free action. The effect lasts 3 rounds and is otherwise the same as the spell.
