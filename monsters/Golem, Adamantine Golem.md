  Destructive Strike (Ex): An adamantine golem's slam attacks threaten a critical
    hit on a 19 or 20. In addition, whenever an adamantine golem scores a critical
    hit, it deals 6d10+13 points of damage to the target's armor or shield in addition
    to the normal damage, as if it had also made a successful sunder combat maneuver.
  Indestructible (Ex): An adamantine golem is nearly impossible to destroy. Even if
    reduced below 0 hit points, its fast healing continues to restore hit points,
    though the golem is helpless unless above 0 hit points. It can only be permanently
    destroyed if reduced to negative hit points and then decapitated using an adamantine
    vorpal weapon-alternatively, miracle or wish can be used to slay it while it is
    at negative hit points.
  Immunity to Magic (Ex): An adamantine golem is immune to any spell or spell-like
    ability that allows spell resistance, except as noted below. Transmute metal to
    wood slows an adamantine golem for 1d4 rounds, during which time its damage reduction
    is reduced to 15/adamantine (no save).
desc_long: Made using one of the hardest and most precious substances, the adamantine
  golem is a deadly work of art. It can crush the life from foes that dare to get
  in its way and is nearly impossible to permanently destroy. The vast amount of adamantine
  required to build even one of these destructive golems is so significant that most
  worlds do not have enough resources, forcing the creator to travel to the Plane
  of Earth or remote Outer Planes simply to gather the raw materials needed to build
  the golem's body.

##### Description

Made using one of the hardest and most precious substances, the adamantine golem is a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ work of art. It can crush the life from foes that dare to get in its way and is nearly impossible to permanently destroy. The vast amount of adamantine required to build even one of these destructive golems is so significant that most worlds do not have enough resources, forcing the creator to travel to the Plane of Earth or remote Outer Planes simply to gather the raw materials needed to build the golem’s body.
