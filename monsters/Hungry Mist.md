    mist must make a Fortitude save (DC 21) or be nauseated for 1 round. In order
    to cast a spell while within the hungry mist, a character must succeed on a Spellcraft
    check (DC 21 + spell level).
  Hive Mind (Ex): Any hungry mist with at least 20 hit points forms a hive mind, giving
    it an intelligence of 6. When a hungry mist is reduced below this hit point threshold,
    it becomes mindless.
