##### Description

Lamhigyns are simple pests that emerged from the

chaotic fabric of the Abyss. They poison their prey until

it falls into a coma, and then they slowly tear it apart,

piece by piece, with their rasping mouths. Lamhigyns

view intruders on their territory with disdain, and their

stings have left many adventurers insane and debilitated,

opportune victims for the Abyss’s insatiable predators.

Though lamhigyns might not appear frightening on their

own, greater terrors sometimes follow in their wakes,

hoping for easy meals.

Lamhigyns are strange-looking creatures often

characterized by mortals visiting the Abyss as overgrown,

f lying tadpoles with bat wings and stinger-tipped

tails. They lurk within dark places in the Abyss and in

similarly lightless places on the Material Plane near

rifts to their home plane. Their bulbous, unblinking

eyes are vaguely froglike, and are often the last things

unprepared adventurers see, as the pesky creatures are

fond of wrapping their wings around their victims’

heads to blind their prey. Their tiny mouths house thick

_[[spells/Tongues|tongues]]_ that f lick about in the presence of prey.

Lamhigyns have thick, scaly skin ranging in color

from red to green. Though lamhigyns are typically

encountered f lying, on the ground they stand on four

insectile legs that they keep tucked beneath them while

nesting. Although they are small, their 2-foot-high,

8-pound bodies are impressive sights when hurtling

through the air at their victims.

When it comes to their own kind, lamhigyns can be

quite volatile. In general, they tend to get along with other

lamhigyns, though almost anything can set them off.

When this happens, lamhigyns unleash the full force of

their chaotic fury on each other, stinging and grappling

until only one—or sometimes none—of the bizarre

creatures remain.

When they’re not fighting among themselves,

lamhigyns live together in noisy, f lapping hives, waiting

for hapless creatures to stumble into their dens. When

it comes to victims, lamhigyns prefer those that can

think and walk, for they provide the most deliciously

terrif ied reactions. There is nothing lamhigyns love

more than _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Injecting|injecting]]_ their mind-numbing toxin into

terrif ied victims while they ineffectually scream and

f lail. Lamhigyns ignore most normal animals unless

they have waited too long for fresh prey and have grown

bored. Sometimes, however, a particularly large hive of

lamhigyns will attempt to bring down large, imposing

creatures simply for the challenge of it.
