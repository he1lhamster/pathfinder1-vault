##### Description

A _tsaalgrend_ is a predatory creature resembling a tangle

of sturdy vines with jagged purple thorns. Its coloration

is mottled with brown, green, and yellow mold patches

that f lake and fall as the creature writhes through the air.

The _tsaalgrend_’s vines barely conceal two translucent,

gas-filled sacks that act as balloons, enabling it to f loat

along above the ground. Two longer vines stretch from

the creature’s center, allowing the _tsaalgrend_ to _[[spells/Snare|snare]]_

its prey. An opening filled with rows of spiky thorns,

positioned on the creature’s underside, serves as the

creature’s mouth. This orifice constantly emits a wet,

rancid _[[universal monster rules/Stench|stench]]_ and a wheezing sigh as warm gas escapes

from its f loatation chambers.

Tsaalgrends are complex, ambulatory fungi, but

also symbiotically support a multitude of other molds,

fungi, mosses, and epiphytes. The most powerful

mold _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Growing|growing]]_ within tsaalgrends produces _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_,

hallucinogenic black spores. Tsaalgrends mainly use

these f ine spores for hunting, and they are capable of

ejecting spores in a wide area to stun prey. Any creature

that breathes in the spores is immediately subject to an

overwhelming terror response as its mind f loods

with primal, animalistic fears. The victim’s

breathing becomes quick and shallow, its

heart rate rises dramatically, and nearby

sounds become dull over the rush of

blood in its ears. The creature’s mind

begs to f lee, but its muscles simply

seize tight. Most victims f ind this

experience maddening enough that

their frustration and panic heighten

the actual chemical effects of the

tsaalgrends’ spores.

Daring alchemists occasionally

hunt and trap tsaalgrends with the

intention of _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Harvesting|harvesting]]_ the black

spores from living specimens and

using them to _[[spells/Fabricate|fabricate]]_ new and

_potent_ inhaled poisons. Securing a living

_tsaalgrend_ is important to the process, for

the spores lose potency soon after they

are released, making storage for later

use impractical. Such alchemists

often run afoul of fungus-focused

druids, who _[[spells/Commune|commune]]_ with and

protect these unusual plants.

Tsaalgrends display a limited

intelligence—easily on par with apes—

and can overcome simple puzzles and challenges.

They communicate basic concepts with each other

through the deliberate transfer of spores. These

bouts of communication involve bursts of various

colors and scents, granting tsaalgrends with large

and more varied symbiotic colonies something akin

to _[[feats/Leadership|leadership]]_ roles. Most often, tsaalgrends “speak” to

each other to coordinate hunting efforts. The plants

also respond to some spoken language, though they lack

a well-developed sense of hearing and show diff iculty

differentiating any but the simplest words and phrases.

Several distinct patches of stubby 1- or 2-inch growths

track light and movement, essentially serving as eyes.

A _tsaalgrend_ typically grows to be over 3 feet long, and

weighs about 40 pounds.
