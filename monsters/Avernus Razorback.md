  Devour Body and Essence (Su): When an Avernus razorback eats a fresh corpse, it
    devours every single part of the body, even the hardest bones. When an Avernus
    razorback devours a body that has been dead for no more than 24 hours, it also
    consumes the soul or spirit of the creature. The creature can't be brought back
    to life by any means short of a miracle or wish spell. It takes a single Avernus
    razorback 10 minutes to devour a Medium or smaller creature plus an additional
    10 minutes for every size category above Medium the creature is. The feeding time
    can be reduced by 10 minutes for each additional Avernus razorback joining in
    the feast (minimum 10 minutes).
  Infernal Ferocity (Su): An Avernus razorback remains conscious and continues to
    fight even when reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. The razorback is staggered,
    but instead of losing 1 hit point per round, it gains regeneration 5 (cold) until
    it has 1 or more hit point. An Avernus razorback loses this ability if it has
    not eaten at least one Small or larger fresh corpse in the past month. It regains
    the ability as soon as it finishes consuming such a corpse that has died within
    24 hours.
desc_long: |-
  Infernal scholars have long debated the origin of the Avernus razorback. Some claim the beasts came into being fully formed as a manifestation of the malice and hate birthed by the unforgiving landscape of Hell's first layer. Others theorize an infernal duke or archdevil once led a massive herd of daeodons to Avernus from the Material Plane to drink from the River Styx and feed on the foul reeds growing amid the waters of Eridanos; over countless generations, these fell influences infused the survivors with the essence of Hell.

  Whatever the genesis of these beasts, they now roam Avernus in huge packs that even most devils avoid. Powerful and fierce, they are territorial animals with a ravenous hunger for both plant and animal life. Their strange Hell-empowered digestion not only devours the body, but also obliterates the soul, ripping a creature's very life essence out of the multiverse entirely-a fate that scares even the denizens of Hell.

##### Description

Infernal scholars have long debated the origin of the _Avernus razorback_. Some claim the beasts came into being fully formed as a manifestation of the malice and hate birthed by the unforgiving landscape of Hell’s first layer. Others theorize an infernal duke or archdevil once led a massive herd of daeodons to Avernus from the Material Plane to drink from the River Styx and feed on the foul reeds _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Growing|growing]]_ amid the waters of Eridanos; over countless generations, these fell influences infused the survivors with the essence of Hell.

Whatever the genesis of these beasts, they now roam Avernus in huge packs that even most devils avoid. Powerful and fierce, they are territorial animals with a _[[curses/Ravenous|ravenous]]_ hunger for both plant and animal life. Their strange Hell-empowered digestion not only devours the body, but also obliterates the soul, ripping a creature’s very life essence out of the multiverse entirely—a fate that scares even the denizens of Hell.
