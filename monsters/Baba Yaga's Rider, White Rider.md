  Blinding Light (Su): The White Rider can radiate a 30-foot-radius aura of blinding
    light as a free action. Creatures within the affected area must succeed at a DC
    23 Fortitude save or be permanently blinded. A creature that successfully saves
    cannot be affected again by the Rider's blinding light aura for 24 hours. The
    save is Constitution-based.
  Rider's Robes (Su): The White Rider wears robes that provide the same protection
    as a breastplate.
  Rider's Weapon (Su): The White Rider has a +2 seeking composite longbow and a quiver
    that produces a never-ending supply of arrows. Once per round, she can draw a
    +1 brilliant energy arrow from her quiver.
desc_long: The White Rider is the most even-tempered and diplomatic of the Three Riders.
  This does not mean that she is sympathetic or merciful, just that there is less
  blood staining the crisp white garments she wears. When the White Rider comes calling,
  citizens of Irrisen often seek to curry favor by bringing her gifts of hot tea,
  pastries, and fresh baked bread. She rarely accepts these offerings, and when she
  does it is only from those she has already judged to be loyal to Baba Yaga and worthy
  of the Queen of Witches's rule. Those who too eagerly attempt to carry favor face
  added scrutiny from her.

##### Description

When the White Rider comes calling, citizens of Irrisen often seek to curry favor by bringing her gifts of hot tea, pastries, and fresh baked bread. She rarely accepts these offerings, and when she does it is only from those she has already judged to be loyal to Baba Yaga and worthy of the Queen of Witches’s rule. Those who too eagerly attempt to carry favor face added scrutiny from her.
