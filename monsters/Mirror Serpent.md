  Natural Invisibility (Su): A mirror serpent has the ability turn its body transparent.
    It remains invisible until it makes an attack, or it can become visible as a free
    action.
  Reflective Skin (Su): When a spell (4th level or lower) that targets a mirror serpent
    fails to penetrate its spell resistance, the mirror serpent can reflect that spell
    back onto the caster or another creature within 10 feet of the caster as an immediate
    action. The mirror serpent can't use this ability when it's invisible.
  Thrash (Ex): A mirror serpent can violently thrash a grappled creature in its mouth
    before it throws the creature away. When a mirror serpent succeeds at a combat
    maneuver check to maintain a grapple, the mirror serpent can deal the target damage
    as normal as well as throw the creature 20 feet in a random direction. The target
    must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex saving throw upon hitting the ground or else it
    takes 2d6 points of falling damage. A target that successfully saves can then
    attempt an additional DC 15 Acrobatics check to avoid landing prone. The save
    DC is Dexterity-based.
desc_long: |-
  Mirror serpents are large snakelike beasts that soar as easily through air as they do water. Ages ago, Azlanti sorcerers employed these serpents to guard their sanctums and vaults. Over the millennia since Earthfall, mirror serpents have grown feral and fiercely territorial. Because they lack the ability to reproduce and grow their number, mirror serpents are quite rare. The arcane knowledge of their creation rituals hasn't resurfaced in the current age; if anyone has discovered it, they have kept it a closely guarded secret. Most surviving mirror serpents reside within the ruins of Azlant, staying near the places they were once tasked to guard. Their original purpose as sentinels has imprinted on them a fascination for treasure. Mirror serpents typically live several centuries, unless they suffer a violent fate, but death does not necessarily spell an end to their existence, which is a constant cycle of death and rebirth. Mirror serpents grow much larger and wiser as they age beyond their first century.

   A mirror serpent's body stretches out to a length of 15 feet and weighs 400 pounds.

##### Description

_[[items/Mundane/Mirror|Mirror]]_ serpents are large snakelike beasts that soar as easily through air as they do water. Ages ago, Azlanti sorcerers employed these serpents to _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_ their sanctums and vaults. Over the millennia since Earthfall, _mirror_ serpents have grown feral and fiercely territorial. Because they lack the ability to reproduce and grow their number, _mirror_ serpents are quite rare. The arcane knowledge of their creation rituals hasn’t resurfaced in the current age; if anyone has discovered it, they have kept it a closely guarded secret. Most surviving _mirror_ serpents reside within the ruins of Azlant, staying near the places they were once tasked to _guard_. Their original purpose as sentinels has imprinted on them a fascination for treasure. _Mirror_ serpents typically live several centuries, unless they suffer a violent fate, but death does not necessarily spell an end to their existence, which is a constant cycle of death and rebirth. _Mirror_ serpents grow much larger and wiser as they age beyond their first century.
