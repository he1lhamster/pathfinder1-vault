title1: Blodeuwedd
desc_short: Clothed in verdant lichen and flowers of broom, meadowsweet, and oak,
  this shapely maiden has skin of velvety moss and living grass for hair. An eldritch
  serenity graces her countenance as she approaches, her outstretched, root-like hands
  brushing the tips of the tallest grass-the wind itself whispers around her feet
  as patches of clover, heather, and milkweed mark her every step.

special_abilities:
  Allergen Aura (Ex): A blodeuwedd exudes an aura of pollen and other irritating allergens
    that forces living creatures within 30 feet to make a DC 18 Fortitude save or
    become sickened, coughing and sneezing for 1d6 rounds. Creatures who successfully
    save cannot be affected by the same blodeuwedd's aura for 24 hours. A blodeuwedd
    can suppress this aura at will as a free action. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Change Shape (Su): A blodeuwedd can assume a single unique humanoid shape or the
    form of a prairie owl once per day for up to 7 hours as if using the spell polymorph.
    These hours do not need to be consecutive and a blodeuwedd can return to her normal
    shape as a free action.
  Nature's Infusion (Su): Once per day, while surrounded by any field or fertile plain,
    a blodeuwedd may infuse herself with borrowed life energy from nearby plants and
    nutrients in the ground. This ability functions exactly like false life (CL 7th)
    but lasts only 1 hour.
  Verdant Step (Su): Every stride taken by a blodeuwedd causes small plants, grasses,
    and wildflowers to sprout from the ground, though she can suppress this effect
    if she desires. While within a plain of tall grass, brush, or similar undergrowth,
    a blodeuwedd may also step through such plant-life and emerge at any other point
    within the same field (potentially miles away). This ability functions similar
    to transport via plants, but a blodeuwedd can only transport herself and does
    not require a plant equal to her size. This ability is usable three times per
    day.
  Wild Empathy (Ex): This works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except
    a blodeuwedd has a +6 racial bonus on the check. A blodeuwedd with druid levels
    adds this racial modifier to her wild empathy checks.
desc_long: The mysterious blodeuwedds stand apart from dryads, their tree-bound sisters
  of the forest, instead watching over the open plains and prairies. They frequently
  guard the approaches to primeval, fey enclaves as well as various gateways and entry
  points into the First World-a task they take very seriously. Blodeuwedds hide such
  regions behind veils of illusion and trickery, quietly observing anyone passing
  through their lands, and occasionally sending mysterious messages to warn them away
  or to summon allies that can drive them out. Even when not standing sentinel over
  a point of otherworldly importance, blodeuwedds find spots of particular natural
  beauty, transforming such fields-usually only a few acres in size-into sites of
  unearthly lushness and natural wonder. A typical blodeuwedd stands a little over
  5 feet tall, weighs 120 pounds, and may live up to 800 years.

# Blodeuwedd
Clothed in verdant lichen and flowers of broom, meadowsweet, and oak, this shapely maiden has skin of velvety moss and living grass for hair. An eldritch _[[spells/Serenity|serenity]]_ graces her countenance as she approaches, her outstretched, root-like hands brushing the tips of the tallest grass—the wind itself whispers around her feet as patches of clover, heather, and milkweed mark her every step.

### Special Abilities

**Allergen Aura (Ex)** A _[[monsters/Blodeuwedd|blodeuwedd]]_ exudes an aura of pollen and other irritating allergens that forces living creatures within 30 feet to make a DC 18 Fortitude save or become _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_, coughing and sneezing for 1d6 rounds. Creatures who successfully save cannot be affected by the same _blodeuwedd_’s aura for 24 hours. A _blodeuwedd_ can suppress this aura at will as a free action. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**_Change Shape_ (Su)** A _blodeuwedd_ can assume a single unique humanoid shape or the form of a prairie owl once per day for up to 7 hours as if using the spell _[[spells/Polymorph|polymorph]]_. These hours do not need to be consecutive and a _blodeuwedd_ can return to her normal shape as a free action.

**Nature's Infusion (Su)** Once per day, while surrounded by any field or fertile plain, a _blodeuwedd_ may infuse herself with borrowed life energy from nearby plants and nutrients in the ground. This ability functions exactly like _[[spells/False Life|false life]]_ (CL 7th) but lasts only 1 hour.

**Verdant Step (Su)** Every stride taken by a _blodeuwedd_ causes small plants, grasses, and wildflowers to sprout from the ground, though she can suppress this effect if she desires. While within a plain of tall grass, brush, or similar undergrowth, a _blodeuwedd_ may also step through such plant-life and emerge at any other point within the same field (potentially miles away). This ability functions similar to _[[spells/Transport via Plants|transport via plants]]_, but a _blodeuwedd_ can only transport herself and does not require a plant equal to her size. This ability is usable three times per day.

**Wild _Empathy_ (Ex)** This works like the _[[classes/Druid|druid]]_’s wild _empathy_ class feature, except a _blodeuwedd_ has a +6 racial bonus on the check. A _blodeuwedd_ with _druid_ levels adds this racial modifier to her wild _empathy_ checks.

##### Description

The mysterious blodeuwedds stand apart from dryads, their tree-bound sisters of the forest, instead watching over the open plains and prairies. They frequently _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_ the approaches to primeval, fey enclaves as well as various gateways and entry points into the First World—a task they take very seriously. Blodeuwedds hide such regions behind veils of illusion and trickery, quietly observing anyone passing through their lands, and occasionally _[[spells/Sending|sending]]_ mysterious messages to warn them away or to _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ allies that can drive them out. Even when not standing sentinel over a point of otherworldly importance, blodeuwedds find spots of particular natural beauty, transforming such fields—usually only a few acres in size—into sites of unearthly lushness and natural wonder. A typical _blodeuwedd_ stands a little over 5 feet tall, weighs 120 pounds, and may live up to 800 years.
