  Poison (Su): |-
    Anytime a creature is grappled by a termagant's tentacles or is affected by its rupture or shared rupture ability, it is exposed to the termagant's flux infusion. Flux infusion functions as a poison, but with unpredictable effects. Those who fail their saving throws take 1d4 points of ability drain. The ability score drained is randomly determined every time the flux infusion affects the creature (roll 1d6: 1-2 Constitution, 3-4 Dexterity, 5-6 Strength). The save DC is Constitution-based.

    Flux Infusion: Injury; save Fort DC 28; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 1d4 Con, Dex, or Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  Rupture (Su): When killed, a termagant explodes in a blast of its flux infusion
    poison. All living creatures within 15 feet must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude
    saving throw or be poisoned. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Shared Rupture (Su): Any creature killed while poisoned by a termagant explodes.
    All living creatures within 10 feet of the creature must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude
    save or be poisoned. The save DC is based on the termagant's Constitution with
    a -5 penalty.
  Unnerving Gaze (Su): A creature that succumbs to a termagant's unnerving gaze becomes
    nauseated for 1d4 rounds as its mind attempts to comprehend the horrors it has
    witnessed.
desc_long: Coddling, cooing mothers of nails and aberrant life, kyton termagants seek
  to make all living creatures adopted members of their malformed brood. That most
  of their purposefully deformed progeny die shortly after coming into their care
  only compels termagants to search farther for sturdier beings better suited to the
  honor of becoming their misshapen children.

##### Description

Coddling, cooing mothers of nails and aberrant life, _kyton_ termagants seek to make all living creatures adopted members of their malformed brood. That most of their purposefully deformed progeny die shortly after coming into their care only compels termagants to search farther for sturdier beings better suited to the honor of becoming their misshapen children.
