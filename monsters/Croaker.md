desc_short: An ominous figure, hands bound before him and his head lolling obscenely
  to one side on a broken neck, hovers forward. His face is obscured by a rotten death
  shroud, a milky eye peering through one worn hole, half its black-tooth-filled mouth
  visible through another rent in the fabric. A horrid rasp of air croaking out pain
  and misery issues from the thing's crushed throat.

  Gallows Bound (Su): A croaker is confined to the area surrounding the gallows where
    it met death. The undead may not travel farther than 1 mile from the site of its
    hanging and prefers to haunt the building or immediate area in which it met its
    demise.
  Hangman's Noose (Su): A croaker may use animate rope at will and may also cause
    any rope or rope-like object to animate and strangle an opponent with supernatural
    strength. The rope gains a Strength of 25 and uses the croaker's base attack bonus
    to grapple a foe. Any foe grappled takes 1d6+7 points of damage per round as her
    throat is crushed. Escaping the grapple or severing the rope frees the victim.
    croakers often hang dead foes from rafters or tree limbs, leaving them on display
    for others to find.
  Maddening Touch (Su): This touch attack deals 1d6 points of Charisma drain and dazes
    the target for 1 round (DC 15 Will save negates the daze effect only). Any creature
    reduced to 0 Charisma by the croaker goes completely insane and often kills herself
    or her former companions.
  Rejuvenation (Su): A slain croaker returns to unlife at full hit points at the next
    sundown. On the anniversary of its wrongful death, a croaker reforms 1 hour after
    it is reduced to 0 hit points. The only way to destroy a croaker is to bring to
    light the true offenders responsible for the crime the croaker swung for and expose
    any malefactors who assisted in framing the croaker or bringing about its wrongful
    hanging.
desc_long: There is no more horrid offense to the gods than the hanging of an innocent
  person. The soul of a man hung for a crime he did not commit cannot go on. It clings
  to the world with a burning hate. The stink of its own body's corruption is all
  it ever knows. This pitiable soul returns as a croaker, an abomination who seeks
  to put others through the hell inflicted upon it-to strangle by their necks until
  dead. It persists for eternity unless the true culprits of the crimes for which
  it swung are brought to justice and punished.

##### Description

There is no more horrid offense to the gods than the hanging of an innocent person. The soul of a man hung for a crime he did not commit cannot go on. It clings to the world with a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Burning|burning]]_ hate. The stink of its own body’s corruption is all it ever knows. This pitiable soul returns as a _croaker_, an abomination who seeks to put others through the hell inflicted upon it—to _strangle_ by their necks until dead. It persists for eternity unless the true culprits of the crimes for which it swung are brought to justice and punished.
