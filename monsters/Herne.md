  Defy the Gods (Su): Hernes gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against divine spells

  Favored Terrain (Ex): A herne gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge
    (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when it is in forest
    terrain. A herne traveling through forest terrain normally leaves no trail and
    cannot be tracked (though he can leave a trail if he so chooses).
  Martial Training (Ex): A herne is proficient with all simple and martial weapons
    and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).
  Swift Tracker (Ex): A herne can move at its normal speed while using Survival to
    follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. A herne takes only a -10 penalty
    (instead of the normal -20) when moving up to twice its normal speed while tracking.
desc_long: |-
  For nearly a century, the Estrovian Forest has been haunted by stag-horned woodsfolk known as hernes. From Egede to Lackthroat, stories are told of these mysterious beings. Some believe them to be the ghosts of hunters betrayed; others say they are fey spirits who guard the woods; and still other believe them to be fiends summoned by worshipers of the Old Faith. While none of these stories are true, they all contain a kernel of truth.

  Hernes superficially resemble the humans from whom they descend, save for the many-pointed antlers which project from their brows. Though they are creatures of flesh and blood, hernes are infused with the spirit of the wild hunt. For the most part, hernes live as humble woodsfolk, reaping the bounty of the forest by their own hands. Yet they are also protectors of the forest, hunting those who abuse it or dare to claim ownership of its reaches. When hernes' anger is roused, they become the avenging spirits the stories make them out to be.

  Hernes tend to be tall and lean. Males stand 6 feet tall or taller-with their antlers adding another foot or so- and weigh around 190 pounds. Female hernes are slightly shorter and lighter, and their antlers are smaller, with fewer points.

##### Description

For nearly a century, the Estrovian Forest has been haunted by stag-horned woodsfolk known as hernes. From Egede to Lackthroat, stories are told of these mysterious beings. Some believe them to be the ghosts of hunters _[[feats/Betrayed|betrayed]]_; others say they are fey spirits who _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_ the woods; and still other believe them to be fiends summoned by worshipers of the Old Faith. While none of these stories are true, they all contain a kernel of truth.

Hernes superficially resemble the humans from whom they descend, save for the many-pointed antlers which project from their brows. Though they are creatures of flesh and blood, hernes are infused with the _[[feats/Spirit of the Wild|spirit of the wild]]_ hunt. For the most part, hernes live as humble woodsfolk, reaping the bounty of the forest by their own hands. Yet they are also protectors of the forest, hunting those who abuse it or dare to claim ownership of its reaches. When hernes’ anger is roused, they become the avenging spirits the stories make them out to be.

Hernes tend to be tall and lean. Males stand 6 feet tall or taller—with their antlers adding another foot or so— and weigh around 190 pounds. Female hernes are slightly shorter and lighter, and their antlers are smaller, with fewer points.
