  Multiplication (Su): When a multiplying skeleton is reduced to 0 hit points, its
    bones reform 1d4 rounds later into two smaller multiplying skeletons with half
    the Hit Dice of the original. Each resulting multiplying skeleton continues to
    reform into smaller and smaller sizes. A multiplying tyrannosaurus skeleton reforms
    into two Large skeletons with 9 HD each, each of which then reforms into two Small
    skeletons with 4 HD each. When these four Small skeletons are killed, the skeleton
    no longer multiplies and is finally destroyed.
  Powerful Bite (Ex): A multiplying tyrannosaurus skeleton applies twice its Strength
    modifier to bite damage.
desc_long: A multiplying skeleton reassembles itself into smaller skeletons when it
  is destroyed. As these smaller skeletons are themselves destroyed, they continue
  to multiply into even more skeletons. Once the skeleton's Hit Dice can no longer
  be halved or the resulting skeletons would be Tiny or smaller, the skeletons are
  finally destroyed. Multiplying skeletons can be created using animate dead, but
  they count as twice their normal number of Hit Dice per casting.

### Special Abilities

**Multiplication (Su)** When a multiplying skeleton is reduced to 0 hit points, its bones reform 1d4 rounds later into two smaller multiplying skeletons with half the Hit Dice of the original. Each resulting multiplying skeleton continues to reform into smaller and smaller sizes. A multiplying tyrannosaurus skeleton reforms into two Large skeletons with 9 HD each, each of which then reforms into two Small skeletons with 4 HD each. When these four Small skeletons are killed, the skeleton no longer multiplies and is finally destroyed.

**Powerful Bite (Ex)** A multiplying tyrannosaurus skeleton applies twice its Strength modifier to bite damage.

##### Description

A multiplying skeleton reassembles itself into smaller skeletons when it is destroyed. As these smaller skeletons are themselves destroyed, they continue to multiply into even more skeletons. Once the skeleton’s Hit Dice can no longer be halved or the resulting skeletons would be Tiny or smaller, the skeletons are finally destroyed. Multiplying skeletons can be created using _[[spells/Animate Dead|animate dead]]_, but they count as twice their normal number of Hit Dice per casting.
