### Special Abilities

**Child-Scent (Ex)** A storm hag has the _[[universal monster rules/Scent|scent]]_ ability, but only

with respect to humanoid children and immature animals.

Thus, she could sniff out a child’s hiding place or a den of

_[[monsters/Wolf|wolf]]_ pups, but not the child’s parents or the den mother.
**Storm Rider (Su)** A storm hag is considered two size

categories larger for the purpose of wind effects.
**Storm Strike (Su)** Each time a storm hag makes a

successful attack with her bite, claws, or a weapon that is

predominantly made of metal, the attack deals an additional

1d6 points of electricity damage.

**Whipping Winds (Su)** As a standard action, a storm hag

can use _gust of wind_ to _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ her foes. This ability can only

affect one target within 30 feet, and the storm hag uses

her normal CMB. The _gust of wind_ doesn’t create its normal

effects. The _trip_ attempt does not provoke an attack of

opportunity, but casting the spell-like ability does as normal.

##### Description

When the clouds turn _[[monsters/Gray|gray]]_ and the winds pick up into a

howl, wise travelers pray that the cause is only a natural

tempest and not a storm hag. A storm hag resembles an

old woman with a thundercloud of hair. Her mouth hangs

open, revealing thin pointed teeth with small arcs of

electricity jumping across them. Black talons sprout from

her fingertips, likewise crackling with electricity. A storm

hag weighs 70 pounds and stands around 4 feet tall, though

if she stood up straight she could easily reach 5 feet.
