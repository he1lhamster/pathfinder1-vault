  Embolotherium are squat, stocky creatures with hollow, bony protrusions on their snouts that are used as sound resonation chambers, allowing the creatures to create very loud noises to communicate across great distances. An average embolotherium stands 5 feet tall at the shoulder, with a nose-to-tail length of about 8 feet and a weight of 6,000 pounds.

  Embolotherium are strict herbivores, grazing on grasses and flowering plants. Their eyesight is very poor, but extremely acute hearing makes up for this deficiency. A herd of embolotherium can be quickly provoked into a stampede, and travelers should be wary of even whispered conversation when near a group of these creatures.

  Naturally social with others of their kind, embolotherium are generally found in large groups in flat, grassy areas. Their many layers of tough skin serve as deterrents to attack as well as thermal buffers, allowing them to survive in even frigid temperatures as long as there is sufficient food.
