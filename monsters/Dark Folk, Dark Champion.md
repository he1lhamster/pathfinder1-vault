    take 3d6 points of fire damage and an additional 2d6 points of piercing damage
    (Reflex DC 17 half). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Fighter Training (Ex): Dark champions are proficient with all simple and martial
    weapons and with all armor and shields. They have a base attack bonus equal to
    their Hit Dice and can select combat feats that have fighter levels as a prerequisite,
    treating their Hit Dice as their fighter level for that purpose.
desc_long: The rare dark folk children born without eyes are assigned to the dark
  champion caste and begin a life of rigor, privation, and martial training. Their
  armor is typically bolted to their bodies in sections and removed only rarely. Most
  other dark folk appreciate the discipline and might of dark champions, but they
  treat them with wary respect.
