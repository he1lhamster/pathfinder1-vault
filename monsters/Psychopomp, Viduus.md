### Special Abilities

**Censor (Su)** A viduus that strikes a living creature with its quill rewrites memories. The target must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or its memories are affected similarly to _[[spells/Modify Memory|modify memory]]_. The viduus can rewrite 1 day’s worth of the target’s memories with a single strike. The target is _[[conditions/Confused|confused]]_ for the next 1d4 rounds. A creature’s memories can be restored by lesser _[[spells/Restoration|restoration]]_, _modify memory_, or similar spells. Memories lost in this manner are copied into one of the numerous tomes protected by the viduus and can be relearned by reading that tome. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Expurgate (Su) A viduus that strikes an undead creature with its quill can obliterate that creature’s memories and rob it of its will to act. The undead creature must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have all of its memories erased. This renders the undead immobile, as if under the effects of _[[spells/Halt Undead|halt undead]]_. An intelligent undead can attempt a saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect, but unintelligent undead remain halted until the effect is removed by an outside force. The effect is _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ if the halted creature is attacked or takes damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Quill (Su)** A viduus’s quill deals piercing damage and is treated as a light weapon and a touch attack. It cannot be used by other creatures as anything other than a standard writing quill.

**_Transformation_ (Su)** A viduus that is reduced to 0 hit points transforms. Its cocoon body bursts open, expelling a swarm of biting black-and-white centipedes (same statistics as a spider swarm) and a bank of _[[spells/Mind Fog|mind fog]]_ (CL 4th) centered on the viduus’s square. A viduus can purposefully transform by spending 3 consecutive full-round actions, in which case it reforms somewhere in the Boneyard 1 month later.

##### Description

Viduuses occupy the many libraries and scriptoriums of the Boneyard, where they catalog the comings and goings of extraordinary souls: their lives, deeds, deaths, and secrets. Existence holds many mysteries, and those mortals who had brushes with the extraordinary have their tales and confessions recorded by these semi-cocooned scholars and added to the volumes of the Boneyard’s expansive libraries. Although pretentious in the extreme, viduuses prove quite knowledgeable about many historical and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Planar|planar]]_ secrets, and what they don’t know they generally have a decent idea of how to research, potentially summoning assistants from across the planes to aid them.
