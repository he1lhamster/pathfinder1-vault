  Flaming Body (Su): A brijidine's body is molten rock covered in dancing flames.
    Anyone striking a brijidine with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 1d6
    points of fire damage. A creature that grapples a brijidine or is grappled by
    one takes 6d6 points of fire damage each round the grapple persists.
  Heat Stone (Su): Whenever a brijidine uses her meld into stone, soften earth and
    stone, spike stones, stone shape, or wall of stone spell-like abilities, she can
    have the affected stone radiate intense heat for 1 minute. Any creature within
    5 feet of the stone takes 1d6 fire damage per round.
  Lava Blast (Su): A brijidine can hurl a glob of lava at a target as a standard action.
    This attack has a range increment of 30 feet.
  Obsidian Blade (Ex): At will as a free action, a brijidine can create a blade of
    jagged volcanic glass that functions as a +1 flaming burst keen longsword. One
    round after it leaves the brijidine's grasp, the weapon decays into useless powder.
desc_long: |-
  Brijidines are passionate, powerful azatas attuned to the powers of earth and fire. They love basking in volcanoes, writing poetry, tending to sick creatures, and pursuing spicy recipes. The quickest way to befriend a brijidine is to present her with a fireproof copy of an exotic poem or a bag of rare peppers. Though their power is tied to primal destruction, they are quick-witted and love clever wordplay, whether in a sonnet or a dirty limerick. 

  The brijidine sees fire as a form of purity, a marked difference from its classical association with devastation and destruction. To a brijidine, the existence of hellfire is the rankest blasphemy, and while many azatas look to the demons of the Abyss as their greatest enemies, it is among the devils of Hell that most brijidines find focus for their anger. The fact that devils are immune to fire, the brijidine's greatest strength, frustrates and angers these azatas all the more, forcing them to become far more imaginative and creative in their tactics when facing such foes. A brijidine stands 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.
