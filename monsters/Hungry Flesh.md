  Monstrous Growth (Ex): A hungry flesh gains growth points from its reactive regeneration
    ability or from eating creatures. When it consumes a creature that's been dead
    no more than an hour, it gains 1 growth point if that creature is of its size
    or one size category smaller, or 2 growth points if its meal is larger than it
    is. Eating a creature takes a fullround action if it is the same size or smaller
    than the hungry flesh or 1 minute if it is larger. Each time a hungry flesh reaches
    5 growth points, it gains the giant creature simple template. This template stacks
    with itself each time the hungry flesh gains another 5 growth points, but the
    hungry flesh can't increase its size beyond Gargantuan. When it stops gaining
    growth points, a hungry flesh loses a single application of the giant creature
    simple template for each hour that passes.
  Reactive Regeneration (Ex): Whenever a hungry flesh takes piercing or slashing damage,
    it regenerates 5 hit points and gains 1 growth point.
  Slime Trail (Ex): A hungry flesh leaves behind a trail of slime that acts as a grease
    spell (DC 17). Any living creature that touches this slime with bare flesh must
    succeed at a Fortitude save (with a +4 bonus) or contract tumor infestation. The
    slime dries up after 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
  Created in a laboratory by an alchemist researching methods of regenerating human flesh, a hungry flesh is a freakish creature made of aggressive, malignant tissue. It lives only to feed and grow, and must consume large amounts of plant and animal matter to sustain itself. Each day, a hungry flesh must consume its own weight in food. A hungry flesh resists attempts to cut or pierce it, quickly repairing the damage and creating new fleshy growths. With the right food and attacks to catalyze its growth, a hungry flesh can balloon to twice its normal size in minutes. A hungry flesh can grow to Gargantuan size.

  A hungry flesh starts out at approximately 7 feet in diameter, and weighs 3,000 pounds.
