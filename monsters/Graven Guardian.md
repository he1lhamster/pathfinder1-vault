    is a bludgeoning weapon). If it is a thrown weapon, it gains the returning weapon
    special ability. If it is a ranged weapon, it gains the seeking weapon special
    ability, and generates new ammunition with each attack (this ammunition is destroyed
    whether or not it hits).

  Graven guardians are human-sized constructs of clay, stone, wood, or similar materials, crafted and painted to resemble a deity or a deity's favored servants. When not in motion, a graven guardian appears identical to a temple or crypt's statue, but while active, graven guardians look extremely lifelike.

  Graven guardians are inexorably tied to a specific deity's faith. While unintelligent and thus lacking any real personality, a graven guardian has the ability to recognize fellow worshipers or minions of its deity and does not treat them as enemies unless they first attack. This recognition does not extend so far as to allow these worshipers (or those cunningly disguised as worshipers) to give a graven guardian new orders. As with all constructs, a graven guardian follows only the orders of its creator.

##### Description

Graven guardians are human-sized constructs of _clay_, stone, wood, or similar materials, crafted and painted to resemble a deity or a deity’s favored servants. When not in motion, a _graven guardian_ appears identical to a temple or crypt’s _statue_, but while active, graven guardians look extremely lifelike.

Graven guardians are inexorably tied to a specific deity’s faith. While unintelligent and thus lacking any real personality, a _graven guardian_ has the ability to recognize fellow worshipers or minions of its deity and does not treat them as enemies unless they first attack. This recognition does not extend so far as to allow these worshipers (or those cunningly disguised as worshipers) to give a _graven guardian_ new orders. As with all constructs, a _graven guardian_ follows only the orders of its creator.
