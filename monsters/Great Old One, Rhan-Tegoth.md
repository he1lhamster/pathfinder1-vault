### Special Abilities

**Always Watching (Ex)** Rhan-Tegoth remains constantly aware of his surroundings, even when he is hibernating in _statue_ form. When he is in _statue_ form as a result of his _statue_ spell-like ability, Rhan-Tegoth can still use his _spell-like abilities_ and the range of his _tremorsense_ increases to 640 feet. Once per day, he can activate his unspeakable presence while in _statue_ form.

**Apocalyptic Dreams (Su)** When Rhan-Tegoth uses his _nightmare_ spell-like ability, he can target any creature that has touched him (even if the touch occurred while Rhan-Tegoth was hibernating), has been affected by any of his other _spell-like abilities_, or has sacrificed a living creature to an image of him, regardless of the distance between himself and the target. In addition to the normal effects of _nightmare_, the target must succeed at a DC 35 Will save or become convinced that the horrific visions of the end of the world experienced in the _nightmare_ are in fact visions of the very near future. Such a victim becomes overwhelmed with despair and loss, and is so distracted by the _[[feats/Conviction|conviction]]_ that its _[[spells/Doom|doom]]_ is imminent that it cannot take swift or immediate actions, cannot concentrate to maintain spells with concentration durations, and takes a –10 penalty on concentration checks to cast spells and on Wisdom based skill checks. Whenever the victim attempts a saving throw against _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effects, it must roll twice and take the worse result. This _fear_ effect lasts for 2d4 days, after which (assuming the world doesn’t end after all) the effect ends. The effect also ends automatically if the victim voluntarily sacrifices a living, sentient creature to Rhan-Tegoth (this is a chaotic evil act)—although in most cases, a creature that performs such a _[[spells/Sacrifice|sacrifice]]_ finds itself targeted with apocalyptic dreams soon thereafter, again and again. This is a mind-affecting _fear_ effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Eternal _Statue_ (Sp)** When Rhan-Tegoth uses his _statue_ spell-like ability, the duration of the effect lasts until the creature under the effect decides to return to flesh.

**Feed (Su)** Once per round when Rhan-Tegoth successfully bites a creature he is grappling, his proboscis feeds on the victim and siphons away bodily fluids at an alarming rate. This attack deals 2d4 points of Constitution drain to the victim unless the victim succeeds at a DC 42 Fortitude save, in which case the feeding instead deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage. For every point of Constitution drain dealt in this way, Rhan-Tegoth regains 10 hit points, and for every point of Constitution damage dealt in this way, he regains 5 hit points. In addition, if Rhan-Tegoth drains more than 4 points of Constitution in this way in a single round, he gains the effects of a _[[spells/Haste|haste]]_ spell for the following round. A creature that is slain by this Constitution drain or damage is reduced to a shriveled corpse riddled with deep, dry holes, and can be restored to life only via _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_, _[[spells/True Resurrection|true resurrection]]_, or _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Immortality (Ex)** If Rhan-Tegoth is slain, he merely petrifies into a _statue_. He remains in _statue_ form, in hibernation, until a living, sentient creature is sacrificed adjacent to the hibernating Great Old One, at which point Rhan-Tegoth is immediately restored to life (as if via _true resurrection_). If no such _sacrifice_ is performed, Rhan-Tegoth can remain in hibernation in this form forever—though certain rare cosmological events can rouse him from his slumber. In this _statue_ form, he has hardness 30 and 300 hp. If the _statue_ of the hibernating Great Old One is destroyed, it crumbles to dust but immediately affects all creatures within 300 feet with Rhan-Tegoth’s unspeakable presence, and Rhan-Tegoth’s consciousness is transplanted into a different _statue_ of the Great Old One (typically one on another world). If no such statues remain in existence at the time of _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_, his consciousness is instead transplanted into a _statue_ in the past or future to await eventual awakening.

**Unspeakable Presence (Su)** Failing a DC 35 Will save against Rhan-Tegoth’s unspeakable presence fills the victim with an irresistible urge to _sacrifice_ a living, sentient creature to the Great Old One. Treat this as a geas/quest spell (CL 28th) that ends the moment the affected creature kills a living, sentient creature in Rhan-Tegoth’s name (this is a chaotic evil act). This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

##### Description

The strange and silent Great Old One known as the Herald of the End Times has spent most of its existence in hibernation, waking for short periods of time after his worshipers rouse him or as the result of singular cosmic events. These periods of wakefulness never last for long, but ancient texts speak of a time when Rhan-Tegoth shall waken fully from his slumber, heralding the dawn of the end of all worlds.

While records of Rhan-Tegoth’s waking periods and his activities during those times are rare and unreliable, rumors still persist of certain chants and rituals that are capable of temporarily waking the Great Old One from his slumber. What reasons might exist for stirring Rhan-Tegoth from his sleep can only be guessed at, for the Great Old One will usually simply consume any foolish enough to rouse him from slumber.

Rhan-Tegoth appears as an aquatic arthropod in shape, yet closer inspection leaves no doubt in the viewer’s mind of the Great Old One’s truly alien nature. His body measures 10 feet from tip to tip, and his legs span 24 feet. The Great Old One weighs 2,000 pounds, but this weight increases to 10 times this amount when he is in _statue_ form. The fact that countless statues of Rhan-Tegoth exist makes it difficult to determine which of them is in fact the actual slumbering god, so care should be taken in proximity of any depiction of the Herald of the End Times.
