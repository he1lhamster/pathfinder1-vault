  Bestial Possession (Su): |-
    A vilkacis is a spirit of savagery and can take control of other beings, afflicting them with its savage nature. Once per round, the vilkacis can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th), except it does not require a receptacle and lasts for up to 3 hours (or a number of hours equal to the vilkacis's Charisma modifier, whichever is greater). To use this ability, the vilkacis must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 18 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same vilkacis's bestial possession for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

    Upon being possessed by a vilkacis, the target takes on a number of bestial features, most notably growing claws and vicious fangs, and flies into a savage rage. The victim gains two claws and a bite natural attack appropriate to its size (1d4 and 1d6 for Medium creatures; see Table 3-1 on page 302 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary), and gains a barbarian's greater rage class ability (see page 31 of the Core Rulebook). This rage lasts for as long as the victim is being possessed by the vilkacis. After the possession ends, the victim is fatigued for a period of time equal to double the duration of the possession. The victim also gains low-light vision and scent. The possessed creature loses all of these natural attacks and abilities immediately when the vilkacis leaves its body.
  Curse of Lycanthropy (Su): Any humanoid who is bitten by a creature possessed by
    a vilkacis must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or be infected with lycanthropy as
    if bitten by a werewolf. If the victim's size is not within one size category
    of the possessed creature's, this ability has no effect. The save DC uses the
    vilkacis's ability scores and is Charisma-based.
  Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex): A vilkacis or creature possessed by a vilkacis can communicate
    and empathize with wolves and dire wolves. It can use its Diplomacy to alter such
    an animal's attitude, and when so doing gains a +4 racial bonus on the check.
  Rejuvenation (Su): A vilkacis that is destroyed in combat restores itself after
    2d4 days. The only way to permanently do away with a vilkacis is to locate its
    canopic stone, the occult artifact that binds it to the Material Plane, and then
    destroy the artifact in the presence of the vilkacis's mortal remains. Once the
    canopic stone is destroyed, the vilkacis can no longer rejuvenate and can be destroyed
    as normal.
  Vulnerability to Silver (Su): Vilkacis are particularly susceptible to silver. A
    vilkacis struck with a silver weapon takes an additional 2d6 points of damage.
    If a creature under the effects of a vilkacis's bestial possession is damaged
    by a silver weapon, it also takes this extra damage and receives another saving
    throw to resist the bestial possession. If successful, the possession ends, and
    the vilkacis is driven into an adjacent square and cannot use its bestial possession
    ability again until the following day.
desc_long: |-
  Beings of pure malevolence and destruction, vilkacis arise from the souls of the most desperate and brutal werewolves as spirits burning with the need for bloodshed and vengeance. Specters of savagery escaped from remains tainted by lycanthropy, vilkacis desire to wear mortal f lesh and again revel in the vicious ecstasy of hunting and killing. Some see these beings as malign manifestations of the lycanthropic curse-the spirits of the infamous aff liction itself-while others know them as the deathly continuance of lives consumed by lycanthropy. In either case, these ravenous spirit-beasts seek only to garb themselves in the skins of deadly hunters and revel in bloodshed once more.

  Vilkacis typically look like more savage versions of the werewolves they were in life, appearing in their hybrid forms with exaggerated fangs and claws.

### Special Abilities

**Bestial _Possession_ (Su)** A _[[monsters/Vilkacis|vilkacis]]_ is a spirit of savagery and can take control of other beings, afflicting them with its savage nature. Once per round, the _vilkacis_ can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a _[[spells/Magic Jar|magic jar]]_ spell (caster level 10th), except it does not require a receptacle and lasts for up to 3 hours (or a number of hours equal to the _vilkacis_’s Charisma modifier, whichever is greater). To use this ability, the _vilkacis_ must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 18 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same _vilkacis_’s bestial _possession_ for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Upon being possessed by a _vilkacis_, the target takes on a number of bestial features, most notably _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Growing|growing]]_ claws and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_ fangs, and flies into a savage _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_. The victim gains two claws and a bite natural attack appropriate to its size (1d4 and 1d6 for _Medium_ creatures; see Table 3–1 on page 302 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary), and gains a _[[classes/Barbarian|barbarian]]_’s greater _rage_ class ability (see page 31 of the Core Rulebook). This _rage_ lasts for as long as the victim is being possessed by the _vilkacis_. After the _possession_ ends, the victim is _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_ for a period of time equal to double the duration of the _possession_. The victim also gains _low-light vision_ and _scent_. The possessed creature loses all of these _[[universal monster rules/Natural Attacks|natural attacks]]_ and abilities immediately when the _vilkacis_ leaves its body.

**_Curse of Lycanthropy_ (Su)** Any humanoid who is bitten by a creature possessed by a _vilkacis_ must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or be infected with lycanthropy as if bitten by a werewolf. If the victim’s size is not within one size category of the possessed creature’s, this ability has no effect. The save DC uses the _vilkacis_’s ability scores and is Charisma-based.

##### Description

Beings of pure malevolence and _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_, _vilkacis_ arise from the souls of the most desperate and brutal werewolves as spirits _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Burning|burning]]_ with the need for bloodshed and _[[feats/Vengeance|vengeance]]_. Specters of savagery escaped from remains tainted by lycanthropy, _vilkacis_ desire to wear mortal f lesh and again revel in the _vicious_ ecstasy of hunting and killing. Some see these beings as malign manifestations of the lycanthropic curse—the spirits of the infamous aff liction itself—while others know them as the deathly continuance of lives consumed by lycanthropy. In either case, these _[[curses/Ravenous|ravenous]]_ spirit-beasts seek only to garb themselves in the skins of _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ hunters and revel in bloodshed once more.

_Vilkacis_ typically look like more savage versions of the werewolves they were in life, appearing in their hybrid forms with exaggerated fangs and claws.
