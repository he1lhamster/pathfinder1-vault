### Special Abilities

**Elemental Realm** While on the Plane of Fire, Ymeri functions as if she had 10 mythic ranks (see Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures), including having the mythic power ability (10/day, surge +1d12). She can _[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ uses of mythic power to use the mythic versions of any spell-like ability denoted with an asterisk (*), as if the ability were a mythic spell. She is also able to use _[[spells/Demand|demand]]_, _[[spells/Discern Location|discern location]]_, _[[spells/Fabricate|fabricate]]_, and  at will as _spell-like abilities_ and dimension lock*, _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_ (limited to physical effects that manipulate the realm or to effects that are relevant to her areas of concern), and _[[spells/Power Word Stun|power word stun]]_* once per day as _spell-like abilities_. Finally, she gains a +10 insight bonus on Perception and initiative checks.

**Elemental Revival (Ex)** If Ymeri is slain, her body crumbles to ash (leaving behind any gear she held or carried), her soul returns to a hidden location within her realm, and she is immediately restored to life (as per _[[spells/True Resurrection|true resurrection]]_) at that location. Once this occurs, Ymeri can’t use this ability again until a full year has passed. If she is slain again during that year or is killed by unusual methods (such as by a true deity or an artifact created for this purpose), she is slain forever.

**Fire Tyrant (Ex)** Ymeri’s servants bow to her will and instinctively follow her commands. As a free action, Ymeri can grant all of her allies with the fire subtype within 300 feet any two of her teamwork feats. Each creature retains these feats until it moves out of range or until Ymeri falls _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_, dies, or uses this ability again. Three times per day as a standard action, Ymeri can manipulate a creature with the fire subtype or a creature on fire that she can detect with her flamesense ability, affecting it as per _[[spells/Hold Monster|hold monster]]_ (CL 28th, Will DC 36 negates). If the target fails the saving throw by 10 or more, it is instead affected as if by _[[spells/Dominate Monster|dominate monster]]_ (CL 28th).

**Flamesense (Ex)** Ymeri can sense the presence and movement of any fire—including creatures with the fire subtype, creatures on fire, and any creature touching the surface of the Plane of Fire—within 300 feet as if using _[[universal monster rules/Blindsight|blindsight]]_. In addition, she can see through fire, fog, and smoke without penalty.

**Limitless Fire (Sp)** As a demigoddess of flame and the Plane of Fire itself, up to three times per day, Ymeri can cast any spell with the fire descriptor as a spell-like ability. She can further augment these spells using _[[feats/Burning Spell|Burning Spell]]_, _[[feats/Empower Spell|Empower Spell]]_, _[[feats/Enlarge Spell|Enlarge Spell]]_, _[[feats/Extend Spell|Extend Spell]]_, Intensify Spell, _[[feats/Maximize Spell|Maximize Spell]]_, _[[feats/Quicken Spell|Quicken Spell]]_, or _[[feats/Widen Spell|Widen Spell]]_, though the effective spell level cannot exceed 9th.

**Pyroportation (Su)** Ymeri can move effortlessly through fiery areas, including lava, superheated metal, and _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Volcanic|volcanic]]_ ash. This effectively grants her the _[[universal monster rules/Earth Glide|earth glide]]_ ability of a magma elemental (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 118); allows her to ignore difficult terrain; and grants her a _[[universal monster rules/Burrow|burrow]]_, _[[universal monster rules/Climb|climb]]_, and swim speed equal to her base speed while in these areas. With rare exceptions, this ability functions in all parts of the Plane of Fire. In addition, as a swift action, Ymeri can teleport to a square in line of sight that is adjacent to a fire of her size or larger.

**_Regeneration_ (Ex)** Only cold damage dealt by an epic weapon, cold damage dealt by a mythic spell, or damage from a creature of equal or greater power (such as a demon lord or a deity) interrupts Ymeri’s _regeneration_.
**Scorching _Rend_ (Su)** If Ymeri hits a target two or more times with at least two different manufactured weapons in the same round, she can cause the target to catch on fire. This functions as the _[[universal monster rules/Burn|burn]]_ universal monster rule, dealing 3d10 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 38 negates catching on fire); however, if the target’s fire _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ would reduce the damage it takes from this ability, it must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude saving throw or reduce its fire _resistance_ by an equal amount for 1 minute. Creatures immune to fire can still be affected by this ability. When such a creature would take 50 or more total points of fire damage from this ability, it loses its _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to fire for 1 minute.

##### Description

Ymeri has declared herself the eternal ruler of the Plane of Fire, going so far as destroying all known records of her origins to suggest she has existed since the dawn of time. Ever since she sealed away her good-aligned _[[feats/Rival|rival]]_ Atreia, the Lambent Prince, within a steam-shrouded garnet, she has driven the efreet in the City of Brass to battle their earth-blooded shaitan cousins.

The Queen of the Inferno rarely has cause to leave the Auroric Palace, from which she rules. When she does, it is at the head of an army. She typically follows such raids by parading across the Plane of Fire, daring others to defy her will.Most fire elementals, some mephits, assorted efreet, and many other creatures with the fire subtype worship Ymeri, though relatively few salamanders revere her. Outside the Plane of Fire, her worship is rare and often restricted to zealous pyrokineticists, cabals of fire wizards, eccentric red dragons, and occasionally fanatical tribes of humanoids. Her _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sacred|sacred]]_ places and temples are often exposed desert ruins, sanctuaries of igneous rock, and shrines built precariously near active volcanoes. Some even feature active magma flows running through their halls or pits that open deep into the earth’s _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Burning|burning]]_ bowels, which her cultists use to _[[spells/Sacrifice|sacrifice]]_ their foes in Ymeri’s name.

Ymeri’s _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Unholy|unholy]]_ symbol is a quartet of _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Flaming|flaming]]_ swords, and her favored weapon is the _longsword_. She grants access to the _[[spells/Destruction|Destruction]]_, Evil, Fire, and War domains, and access to the subdomains of Ash, Catastrophe, _[[universal monster rules/Fear|Fear]]_, and Tactics.
