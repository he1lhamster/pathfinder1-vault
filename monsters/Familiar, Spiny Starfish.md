    as a result of having the grab ability).
  Rapid Healing (Ex): A spiny starfish heals very quickly, regaining a number of hit
    points each hour equal to its Hit Dice (1 hp per hour for the typical spiny starfish).
desc_long: Spiny starfish are marine invertebrates that wander the sea floor in search
  of mollusks and other slow-moving prey. Their tube feet afford them an excellent
  grip on their chosen food source, and they can famously expel their stomachs into
  subdued shellfish to digest their meals. An injured spiny starfish heals wounds
  quickly, even regrowing lost limbs over time.
