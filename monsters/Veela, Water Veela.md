### Special Abilities

**Beckoning Dance (Su)** As a standard action, a veela can compel

a target that it can see to join it in _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Dancing|dancing]]_. The target must

succeed at a DC 21 Will save or find herself forced to dance with

the veela for up to 1 minute. At the end of each of the target’s

turns, she must attempt a Perform (dance) check opposed by

the veela’s Perform (dance) check. If the target doesn’t meet or

exceed the veela’s result, she takes 1d4 points of Constitution

damage and becomes _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_. For every point of Constitution

damage a veela deals in this way, it heals 5 hit points. Hit

points healed in excess of its maximum become temporary hit

points that last up to 1 hour before dissipating. While engaged

in a beckoning dance, both a veela and its target are protected

from being attacked as if by a _[[spells/Sanctuary|sanctuary]]_ spell (DC 18). Any

target of a veela’s beckoning dance that exceeds the veela’s

result on the opposed Perform check ends the beckoning dance

and gains the benefits of the veela’s _cure serious wounds_ spell-like

ability (if any uses of that ability remain), which consumes

one of the veela’s daily uses. Targets that save against a veela’s

beckoning dance can’t be affected by that veela’s beckoning

dance again for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Elemental _Veil_ (Su)** A veela’s link to a particular element

manifests as an overflow of energy that infuses its natural

attacks and any melee weapons it holds, causing it to deal an

extra 1d6 points of damage on any successful melee attack.

This is electricity damage for an air veela, bludgeoning damage

for an earth veela, fire damage for a fire veela, and cold

damage for a water veela. In addition, as a standard action a

veela can wreathe itself in a luminescent halo of energy. This

duplicates the effect of the spell _[[spells/Fire Shield|fire shield]]_ (caster level 9th) but

deals damage of the same damage type as the extra melee

damage. Ending or resuming this effect is a standard action.
