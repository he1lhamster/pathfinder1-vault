  Hear Heartbeat (Ex): A banshee can sense the beating hearts of living creatures
    within 60 feet, as if it had the blindsight ability.
  Terror (Su): A creature damaged by the banshee's touch attack must make a DC 23
    Will save. Failure means that the victim cowers in fear for 1d3 rounds. If a target
    is protected against fear by a dispellable effect (such as heroes' feast or mind
    blank), the banshee's touch attempts to dispel one such effect with greater dispel
    magic (CL 14th). Negative energy damage caused by a banshee's touch can only harm
    the living; it cannot heal undead. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save
    DC is Charisma-based.
  Wail (Su): Once per minute, a banshee may wail as a full-round action. The wail
    lasts until the beginning of her next turn. All creatures within 40 feet of the
    banshee when she begins her wail, as well as all creatures that end their turn
    within that radius, must make a DC 23 Fortitude save. (This save is only required
    once per wail.) Creatures under the effects of a fear effect take a -4 penalty
    on this save. Creatures that make their save are sickened for 1d6 rounds. Those
    that fail take 140 points of damage (as if affected by a CL 14 wail of the banshee).
    If a wailing banshee is damaged during a wail, she must make a Will save (DC 15
    + damage taken) to maintain the wail; otherwise it ends. This is a sonic death
    effect. Banshee wails are supernaturally powerful, and penetrate the effect of
    any spell of 3rd level or lower that creates silence. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: A banshee is the enraged spirit of an elven woman who either betrayed those
  she loved or was herself betrayed. Maddened by grief, a banshee visits her vengeance
  on all living creatures-innocent or guilty-with her fearsome touch and deadly wails.

**Terror (Su)** A creature damaged by the _banshee_’s touch attack must make a DC 23 Will save. Failure means that the victim cowers in _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ for 1d3 rounds. If a target is protected against _fear_ by a dispellable effect (such as heroes’ feast or _[[spells/Mind Blank|mind blank]]_), the _banshee_’s touch attempts to dispel one such effect with greater _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ (CL 14th).

All creatures within 40 feet of the _banshee_ when she begins her wail, as well as all creatures that end their turn within that radius, must make a DC 23 Fortitude save. (This save is only required once per wail.) Creatures under the effects of a _fear_ effect take a –4 penalty on this save. Creatures that make their save are _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ for 1d6 rounds. Those that fail take 140 points of damage (as if affected by a CL 14 _[[spells/Wail of the Banshee|wail of the banshee]]_). If a wailing _banshee_ is damaged during a wail, she must make a Will save (DC 15 + damage taken) to maintain the wail; otherwise it ends. This is a sonic death effect. _Banshee_ wails are supernaturally powerful, and penetrate the effect of any spell of 3rd level or lower that creates _[[spells/Silence|silence]]_. The save DC is Charisma-based.

##### Description

A _banshee_ is the enraged spirit of an elven woman who either _[[feats/Betrayed|betrayed]]_ those she loved or was herself _betrayed_. Maddened by grief, a _banshee_ visits her _[[feats/Vengeance|vengeance]]_ on all living creatures—innocent or guilty—with her fearsome touch and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ wails.
