### Special Abilities

**Blood Healing (Ex)** A patch of _[[monsters/Gluttongrass|gluttongrass]]_ attacks with three fronds—these are primary _[[universal monster rules/Natural Attacks|natural attacks]]_ that deals slashing damage. When _gluttongrass_ damages a creature that can be affected by its _bleed_ attack, the _gluttongrass_ has 1 hit point restored. If a creature is already suffering from a _bleed_ effect, the _gluttongrass_ instead has 2 hit points restored for each successful frond attack.

**Take _Root_ (Ex)** _Gluttongrass_ can embed its roots in soil as a full-round action or uproot itself as a standard action. While _gluttongrass_ is rooted, it cannot move, but it can take 20 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as if it had the _[[universal monster rules/Freeze|freeze]]_ ability. _Gluttongrass_ gains a +8 circumstance bonus to CMD against bull rush and other combat maneuvers that attempt to shift its location while it has taken _root_.

##### Description

Scholars are unsure of the origins of this strange, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ plant life. The typical suspicions persist that it is the result of a mad _[[classes/Wizard|wizard]]_’s experiments or the deliberate cultivations of druidic sects that have adopted anticivilization philosophies, yet those who have taken the time to truly examine these blood-drinking growths have noted disturbing elements that suggest a darker genesis. These botanists theorize that _gluttongrass_ is seeded by the remnants of a creature that has died from starvation, whether in the wilds or in more urban territories. Indeed, patches of _gluttongrass_ have been discovered flourishing in areas devastated by _[[curses/Famine|famine]]_ and around settlements whose populations have perished due to food supplies being cut off (such as in times of siege or after raiders have burned local crops). However, it has also been identified _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Growing|growing]]_ seemingly at random throughout forested areas and plains, blending in with normal grasses and other foliage, so certainly _famine_ and starvation are not requirements for this plant’s growth.

Whatever its origin, one thing is certain: while a mindless plant, _gluttongrass_ is far from harmless. Well-fed patches of this carnivorous grass average a height of 5 feet, with razor-sharp stalks able to pierce exposed skin with ease. Wary travelers should avoid rushing blindly through tall fields, as smaller patches of _gluttongrass_ have been known to extend their roots toward one another, _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Merging|merging]]_ and slowly increasing their collective size, reach, and hunger. Some of the largest _gluttongrass_ fields are suspected to have claimed hundreds of victims over the years.
