special_abilities:
  Defensive Slam (Ex): A calikang gains a cumulative +1 shield bonus to its AC for
    each of its arms that does not wield a manufactured weapon, to a maximum of +4
    for four hands. A calikang can make slam attacks with these arms without losing
    this AC bonus.
  Energy Absorption (Su): A spell that inflicts energy damage that is defeated by
    the calikang's SR or immunity to electricity is absorbed into its body, healing
    it for an amount of damage equal to the absorbed spell's caster level and granting
    an additional daily use of its breath weapon.
  Breath Weapon (Su): A calikang can choose what kind of energy damage its breath
    weapon inflicts when it uses this ability, choosing from acid, cold, electricity,
    fire, or sonic energy. Calikangs are particularly adept at using electricity in
    this manner, and inflict 1 additional point of damage per die (+14 for most calikangs)
    when they elect to inflict electricity damage with their breath weapon.
  Suspend Animation (Su): As a full-round action, a calikang can enter a state of
    suspended animation, freezing in place and becoming motionless. It remains aware
    of its surroundings. In this state, the calikang is immune to disease, inhaled
    toxins, poison, starvation, and thirst, and receives a +4 bonus on all Fortitude
    saves. The calikang can exit this state as an immediate action-if it does so to
    attack a foe or initiate combat, it gains a +4 insight bonus on its Initiative
    check.
desc_long: |-
  The calikang is a much sought-after guardian of treasuries, harems, and fortifications. Legend holds that, an untold number of eons ago, one of the thousand deities of Vudra failed at a task, and the first calikangs were born from that god's severed fingers. Calikangs have powerful sense of guilt and shame over their divine source's ancient failings, and they believe that if enough calikangs protect worldly holdings from robberies or destruction, this inherited sin will someday be wiped clean.

  Calikangs are 14 feet tall and weigh 4,000 pounds. They can live for 200 years- though many extend their lives beyond this via suspended animation.
