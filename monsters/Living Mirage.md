### Special Abilities

**Consuming _Mirage_ (Ex)** A _[[monsters/Living Mirage|living mirage]]_ can _[[universal monster rules/Engulf|engulf]]_ foes (as

per the universal monster ability). A creature engulfed

by a _living mirage_ doesn’t gain the _[[conditions/Pinned|pinned]]_ condition and

can move normally—such a creature is not in danger of

suffocating—but as long as it begins its turn engulfed, it’s

subject to desiccation in addition to the damage the attack

causes. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Desiccation (Ex)** A _living mirage_ siphons streamers of blood

and other vital fluids away from living creatures it touches

or engulfs. A living creature that takes damage from the

_living mirage_ must succeed at a Constitution check to

avoid the effects of thirst, with a DC equal to either the DC against thirst as if

1 additional hour had passed or half the amount of damage

dealt by the _living mirage_, whichever is higher. The target

takes a cumulative –1 penalty on this check for each

consecutive round beyond the first it takes damage from

the _living mirage_. A creature that takes nonlethal damage

from thirst as a result of this ability is _[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_.

Gaseous (Ex) A _living mirage_ has a body composed of

shimmering air. It can pass through small holes or narrow

openings, even mere cracks, but cannot enter water or

other liquid. It has no Strength score, and cannot manipulate

objects as a result.

**_[[universal monster rules/Natural Invisibility|Natural Invisibility]]_ (Ex)** A _living mirage_

remains _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ at all times, even

when attacking. This ability isn’t

subject to the _[[spells/Invisibility Purge|invisibility purge]]_

spell. Against foes that cannot

pinpoint its location, a living

_mirage_ gains a +20 bonus

on Stealth checks when

moving or a +40 bonus

when standing still. These

bonuses are not included

in the statistics above.

Because of its size and

pervasiveness within

the area it occupies, a

_living mirage_ gains only a

20% miss chance due to

its _invisibility_.

**Project _Mirage_ (Ex)** As

a standard action, a living

_mirage_ can create an illusory

_vision_ in areas of extreme _[[universal monster rules/Heat|heat]]_

or reflection—such as a desert,

open ocean, or snow plain—to lure

victims toward it, instinctively using the

victims’ own desires for _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Comfort|comfort]]_ to form the

illusion. This is a nonmagical mind-affecting glamer effect

that is otherwise identical to _[[spells/Hallucinatory Terrain|hallucinatory terrain]]_ and that

the _living mirage_ can dismiss as a swift action. The save

DC to disbelieve the illusion is Charisma-based, and the DC

includes a +4 racial bonus.

**Vulnerable to Wind (Ex)** A _living mirage_ is treated as if it

were a Small creature for the purposes of determining the

effects high wind has upon it.

##### Description

A _living mirage_ is a cloud of shimmering air that dwells in

warm and cold deserts and calm stretches of open ocean.

Although those who have lost loved ones to living mirages

revile them as _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_ deceivers, living mirages are in fact

mindless, without any motive beyond feeding on the water

and minerals found in living bodies. They manage to show

hallucinations of what a victim desires not because of any

intelligence on the _living mirage_’s part, but because the

victim’s own mind generates the illusions.
