    exhale a 10-foot cube of poisonous gas. This gas cloud persists for 1 round; any
    creature within the area when the golem creates it (as well as any creature that
    passes through the cloud during the remainder of that round) is exposed to the
    cloud's poisonous effects. This poison is magically created each time the golem

  Immunity to Magic (Ex): An iron golem is immune to spells or spell-like abilities
    that allow spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against
    it, as noted below. A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows an iron
    golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.A magical attack
    that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of
    damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount
    of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains
    any excess as temporary hit points. An iron golem gets no saving throw against
    fire effects.An iron golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as those
    of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.
  Powerful Blows (Ex): An iron golem inflicts one and a half times its Strength modifier
    and threatens a critical hit on a 19-20 with its slam attacks.
desc_long: |-
  An iron golem has a humanoid body made from iron. It can be sculpted into any shape its creator desires, but it almost always displays armor of some sort, from simple and utilitarian to ceremonial and ornate. Its features are much smoother than those of a stone golem. Iron golems sometimes carry a weapon in one hand, though they rarely use these, relying instead on their slam attacks.

  An iron golem is 12 feet tall and weighs about 5,000 pounds. An iron golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have any distinguishable odor.

  Although the practice has fallen out of favor in modern times, the ancients of certain powerful civilizations once took great pride in crafting iron golems of tremendous size and strength. These golems, which are never smaller than Huge, still exist in remote parts of the world, mindlessly following the orders of a long-dead empire.

##### Description

An iron golem has a humanoid body made from iron. It can be sculpted into any shape its creator desires, but it almost always displays armor of some sort, from simple and utilitarian to ceremonial and ornate. Its features are much smoother than those of a stone golem. Iron golems sometimes carry a weapon in one hand, though they rarely use these, relying instead on their slam attacks.

An iron golem is 12 feet tall and weighs about 5,000 pounds. An iron golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have any distinguishable odor.

Although the practice has _[[monsters/Fallen|fallen]]_ out of favor in modern times, the ancients of certain powerful civilizations once took great pride in crafting iron golems of tremendous size and strength. These golems, which are never smaller than Huge, still exist in remote parts of the world, mindlessly following the orders of a long-dead empire.
