##### Description

Servants of the dark gods of the wastes, shas stalk the

deepest deserts, skirting the edges of civilization.

Villagers whisper that a _sha_ nears when they spot faint

red lights in the distance, believing those lights to be

the creatures’ _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Menacing|menacing]]_ eyes. Many times, these

sightings are only imagined, but shas do prowl

near settlements and keep an eye on humankind. Shas’ urge

to hunt people who have ceased to remember and honor

their patrons drives them to attack caravans, harass remote

villages, and prowl isolated oases to slaughter humanoids.

Shas possess a distinctly canine appearance, and are

often mistaken at night for common jackals whose eyes are

illuminated by firelight. Black fur, tinted with the dust and

sand of the desert, covers a _sha_’s body. The creature’s spiralended

eyes glow a dull red. Explorers report that seeing

a _sha_’s eyes glowing in the dark night is often the only

indication of an impending attack. A _sha_’s _[[spells/Strong Jaw|strong jaw]]_, lined

with razor-sharp teeth, allows the creature to _[[feats/Drag Down|drag down]]_

larger prey in a fashion similar to that of a _[[monsters/Wolf|wolf]]_. Standing at

chest height to most humans, shas weigh between 100 and

150 pounds.

When alone, a _sha_ spends its days trekking the vast

wastelands of the desert, prowling among lost monuments

of ancient times. While wandering the deserts, shas attack

small convoys or groups of nomads along the desert

fringes. Using their innate ability to conjure sandstorms,

shas close in on the unsuspecting groups and try to bite

as many different enemies as possible, then retreat before

their foes can regroup. By doing this, the shas ensure that

survivors return to civilization mad with disease and then

spread the sickness to others or act on their insane urges.

When packs of shas come together, they usually do so

because a number of their kind happen upon each other

in pursuit of a caravan or some other nomadic prey, then

decide to continue hunting together once they feed. Packs

quickly dissolve as prey grows scarce.
