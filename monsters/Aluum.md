  Immunity to Magic (Ex): An aluum is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that
    allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently
    against the creature. A magical attack that uses negative energy (such as channel
    negative energy, inflict light wounds, or enervation) deals no damage, but speeds
    up the aluum's attacks and movement as if it were under the effects of a haste
    spell for 1d6 rounds. A magical attack that uses positive energy slows the aluum
    as if by a slow spell for 1d6 rounds and dispels any haste effects currently affecting
    it. Magic jar confuses the creature for 1d6 rounds.
  Paralysis (Su): The touch of an aluum paralyzes living creatures that fail a DC
    17 Fortitude save for 1d4 minutes. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Soul Shriek (Su): As a free action every 1d4 rounds, the aluum's enslaved souls
    may emit a keening wail in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take 10d6 points
    of sonic damage and are stunned for 1 round. A DC 15 Will save halves the damage
    and negates the stun effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC
    is Constitution-based.

  Aluums are magical constructs created from metal and stone native to Katapesh. They are the fighting juggernauts that maintain order within the city of Katapesh when the city's normal means of doing so fail. Aluums are powered by the souls of Katapeshi slaves and prisoners bound into glowing gems in their chests.

  An aluum stands approximately 14 feet tall and weighs over 2 tons. They are controlled by magical pendants called charms of aluum control (see page 298).
