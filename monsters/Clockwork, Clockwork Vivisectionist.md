  Anesthetizing Injection (Ex): A clockwork vivisectionist that has pinned a victim
    can try to anesthetize the victim with fluid-filled syringes normally stored in
    the vivisectionist's chest compartment. The vivisectionist performs the injection
    as a standard action. This deals no damage, but the victim must succeed at a DC
    16 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d6 minutes. This is a poison effect. The
    save DC is Constitution-based.
  Efficient Winding (Ex): A clockwork vivisectionist can function for 2 days per Hit
    Die every time it is wound.
  Standby (Ex): A clockwork vivisectionist can place itself on standby as a standard
    action. While on standby, a clockwork vivisectionist cannot move or take any actions,
    but it remains aware of its surroundings. Time spent on standby does not count
    against the vivisectionist's wind-down duration. A clockwork vivisectionist can
    exit standby as a swift action.

Clockwork vivisectionists enter combat only to paralyze victims for later vivisection.
