# Sikari Macaque Swarm
Hundreds of tiny, hairless, reddish-hued monkeys burst from the thick jungle canopy. All at once, they’re climbing every tree, swinging from every branch, covering every inch of the ground. Their mouths seem permanently open in a yowling shriek, a cacophony of _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ only half as fearsome as their tiny, bulbous black eyes.

These effects last for 1d6 rounds, and the effects of multiple bites are cumulative.

While the fast-acting nature of this effect is similar to a poison, it is actually a disease, and the spell _remove disease_ immediately ends the effects. Creatures that are immune to disease are also immune to this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

Often _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ the Red Wind, a churning mass of Sikari macaques feels no _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_, barely acknowledges pain, and destroys everything in its path. A species of monkeys native to the Sikari region of Vudra, Sikari macaques are small, hairless, and mean. Their appearance and temperament are not native traits, however, as within recorded Vudran history nearly every member of the species has _[[monsters/Fallen|fallen]]_ victim to a mysterious affliction known as Sikari _rage_. Thus, what was once a highly social and endearingly curious breed of tawny-furred monkeys has been reduced to gangs of flesh-hungry brutes shrieking through jungle boughs, consuming and demolishing anything in their path.

A typical Sikari macaque stands just over 1 foot tall and weighs less than 5 pounds. Swarms of these _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ primates usually number from 30 to nearly a hundred.
