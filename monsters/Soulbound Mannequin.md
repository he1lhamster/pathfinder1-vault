  Disguise Self (Sp): The soulbound mannequin can only disguise itself as the living
    person it used to be at approximately the age it was when its soul was used to
    make the mannequin (this allows it to take the appearance of another creature
    type).
  Soul Focus (Su): The soul bound to the mannequin lives within a focus integrated
    into the doll or its apparel, typically a carved mask. As long as this soul focus
    remains intact, it can be used to animate another mannequin, at the same cost
    as creating a new soulbound mannequin. The new mannequin retains its personality
    and memories. A soul focus has hardness 8, 12 hit points, and a break DC of 20.
  Susceptible to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex): Unlike most constructs, a soulbound
    mannequin is not immune to mind-affecting effects.
desc_long: A soulbound mannequin is a human-sized improvement on the soulbound doll
  (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 255). The binding process is sophisticated enough to
  leave much of the soul's personality intact. Most are crafted to allow a faithful
  servant to remain with a prestigious family or to allow a dying loved one to remain
  among the living in a limited way. Because the mannequin's face is expressionless
  and its voice has little inf lection, it carries several masks that it uses to convey
  emotions. It often serves its creator as a bodyguard, companion, servant, sentry,
  or even paramour.

##### Description

A _soulbound mannequin_ is a human-sized improvement on the _[[monsters/Soulbound Doll|soulbound doll]]_ (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 255). The _[[spells/Binding|binding]]_ process is sophisticated enough to leave much of the soul’s personality intact. Most are crafted to allow a faithful servant to remain with a prestigious family or to allow a _[[conditions/Dying|dying]]_ loved one to remain among the living in a limited way. Because the mannequin’s face is expressionless and its voice has little inf lection, it carries several masks that it uses to convey emotions. It often serves its creator as a _[[feats/Bodyguard|bodyguard]]_, companion, servant, sentry, or even paramour.
