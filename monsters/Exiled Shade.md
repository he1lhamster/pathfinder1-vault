  Exiled (Ex): The symbols of an exiled shade's former organization still hold power
    over its restless spirit. An exiled shade that can see such a symbol is sickened
    for as long as the symbol remains visible. Additionally, if a shade is directly
    confronted with such a symbol (which requires a standard action) it must succeed
    at a DC 16 Will save or become dazed for 1 round. If the shade succeeds, it can
    no longer be dazed in this manner for 24 hours, but remains sickened while in
    the symbol's presence. If this symbol is a holy symbol and is used in the act
    of channeling energy, the exiled shade does not gain its channel resistance against
    the effect. The symbol must be something the exiled shade's organization used
    to identify its members while the shade was alive, such as a noble crest, a knightly
    banner, or a holy icon.
  Intelligence Damage (Su): An exiled shade's touch clouds the target's mind with
    anger and resentment, dealing 1d6 points of Intelligence damage. This is an emotion-based,
    mind-affecting, negative energy effect.
  Rage Thrall (Su): If an exiled shade deals a cumulative amount of Intelligence damage
    greater than or equal to a humanoid target's actual Intelligence score, the affected
    creature does not fall unconscious as normal. Instead, the target ceases to take
    penalties from its Intelligence damage and falls under the control of the exiled
    shade, as per dominate person. Creatures so dominated cannot attempt new saving
    throws to escape the shade's control until their Intelligence damage no longer
    equals or exceeds their actual Intelligence score. An exiled shade can control
    only a single creature in this manner. If an exiled shade deals enough Intelligence
    damage to a second creature to activate this ability, the first creature is relinquished
    from its control (though it might immediately fall unconscious if its Intelligence
    damage equals or exceeds its actual Intelligence score).
desc_long: |-
  An exiled shade is a wretched, undead remnant of an evil organization. Driven out and possibly even slain by its former allies, the exiled shade wallows in the pain of its betrayal and its paradoxical desires to simultaneously destroy and be reunited with its former comrades. 

  Exiled shades linger near the places they once served, but are psychologically unable to return to the places from which they were exiled. Instead they attack lonesome travelers, enslaving them to use as puppets against their onetime allies. 

  An exiled shade is approximately 6 feet tall.

### Special Abilities

**Exiled (Ex)** The symbols of an _[[monsters/Exiled Shade|exiled shade]]_’s former organization still hold power over its restless spirit. An _exiled shade_ that can see such a symbol is _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ for as long as the symbol remains visible. Additionally, if a shade is directly confronted with such a symbol (which requires a standard action) it must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or become _[[conditions/Dazed|dazed]]_ for 1 round. If the shade succeeds, it can no longer be _dazed_ in this manner for 24 hours, but remains _sickened_ while in the symbol’s presence. If this symbol is a holy symbol and is used in the act of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Channeling|channeling]]_ energy, the _exiled shade_ does not gain its _channel resistance_ against the effect. The symbol must be something the _exiled shade_’s organization used to _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ its members while the shade was alive, such as a noble crest, a knightly _[[items/Mundane/Banner|banner]]_, or a holy icon.

**Intelligence Damage (Su)** An _exiled shade_’s touch clouds the target’s mind with anger and resentment, dealing 1d6 points of Intelligence damage. This is an emotion-based, mind-affecting, negative energy effect.

**_Rage_ Thrall (Su)** If an _exiled shade_ deals a cumulative amount of Intelligence damage greater than or equal to a humanoid target’s actual Intelligence score, the affected creature does not fall _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_ as normal. Instead, the target ceases to take penalties from its Intelligence damage and falls under the control of the _exiled shade_, as per _[[spells/Dominate Person|dominate person]]_. Creatures so dominated cannot attempt new saving throws to escape the shade’s control until their Intelligence damage no longer equals or exceeds their actual Intelligence score. An _exiled shade_ can control only a single creature in this manner. If an _exiled shade_ deals enough Intelligence damage to a second creature to activate this ability, the first creature is relinquished from its control (though it might immediately fall _unconscious_ if its Intelligence damage equals or exceeds its actual Intelligence score).

##### Description

An _exiled shade_ is a wretched, undead remnant of an evil organization. Driven out and possibly even slain by its former allies, the _exiled shade_ wallows in the pain of its betrayal and its paradoxical desires to simultaneously destroy and be reunited with its former comrades.

Exiled _[[spells/Shades|shades]]_ linger near the places they once served, but are psychologically unable to return to the places from which they were exiled. Instead they attack lonesome travelers, enslaving them to use as puppets against their onetime allies.

An _exiled shade_ is approximately 6 feet tall.
