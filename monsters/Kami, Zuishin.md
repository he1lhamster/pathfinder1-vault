    consumes a use of the same spell-like ability. The zuishin must make a touch attack
    to deliver the effect to the target-the target takes no damage from the arrow.'
  Holy Weapons (Su): Any weapon wielded by a zuishin is treated as if it had the holy
    special ability. A zuishin creates arrows out of nothing as part of its attacks
    with any bow it wields.
desc_long: |-
  While all kami are enemies of oni, none are so fervent as the zuishin. Known also as shrine kami, zuishin take as their wards gates, doorways, religious places, and the spiritual archways known as torii, ensuring that the gates are respected. Zuishin can use many weapons, but tend to favor the bow. A zuishin treats its equipment with utmost care, viewing weapons as extensions of itself. It never discards its bow voluntarily; if the weapon is ever lost or destroyed, a zuishin can craft a new one in a month.

  Zuishin treat other kami with respect, and are always willing to lend a helping hand. Creatures other than kami must earn a zuishin's trust before receiving its aid, and do so by honoring the gate it guards or providing an offering to the kami, such as a tree branch or other small piece of nature.

  Zuishin manifest as suits of armor with a partly manifest warrior within, and wield glowing weapons. They stand 5 feet tall and weigh 120 pounds.
