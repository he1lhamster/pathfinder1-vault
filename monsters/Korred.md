  Animated Hair (Su): A korred's hair is constantly writhing and twitching. As a free
    action, a korred can cause its long hair to reach out and interfere with adjacent
    creatures-tugging at clothes and weapons, tangling feet and arms, tickling, and
    generally making a nuisance of itself. The korred can select which adjacent targets
    are affected by its animated hair. These targets must make a successful DC 16
    Reflex save each round to avoid becoming entangled for 1 round. The save DC is
    Dexterity-based.
  Stone Stride (Su): This ability works like tree stride, except it requires loose
    boulders at least as large as the korred, and only has a range of 30 feet. The
    korred can use this ability once per round as a standard action.
  Stunning Laugh (Su): Three times per day as a standard action, a korred can unleash
    a strange laugh that stuns all creatures within a 30-foot burst for 1d2 rounds
    (Fortitude DC 14 negates). This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. Fey are immune
    to this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  Korreds are an ancient fey race who like forested areas with nice, rocky ground. They resemble small, wild-haired humanoids with wild, knotted hair. Korreds especially like to dance in ancient stone circles within forest glades, often led by satyrs with panpipes. They are a shy race and do not take kindly to outsiders discovering them, even by accident. They almost always attack non-korreds who stumble into their territory, seeking to kill them or at least drive them off.

  Korred clothing normally consists of a simple leather apron, jerkin, or kilt, leaving their legs uncovered and their feet bare. Their clothes usually have a large pocket or pouch to hold their belongings. A korred's hair and beard grow quickly, sometimes an inch a day, and the korred trims its hair when the locks become too unruly, saving the trimmings in its pocket so it can weave them into ropes for its animate rope spell-like ability.

##### Description

Korreds are an ancient fey race who like forested areas with nice, rocky ground. They resemble small, wild-haired humanoids with wild, knotted hair. Korreds especially like to dance in ancient stone circles within forest glades, often led by satyrs with panpipes. They are a shy race and do not take kindly to outsiders discovering them, even by accident. They almost always attack non-korreds who stumble into their territory, seeking to kill them or at least drive them off.

_Korred_ clothing normally consists of a simple leather apron, jerkin, or _[[items/Mundane/Kilt|kilt]]_, leaving their legs uncovered and their feet bare. Their clothes usually have a large pocket or pouch to hold their belongings. A _korred_’s hair and beard grow quickly, sometimes an inch a day, and the _korred_ trims its hair when the locks become too unruly, saving the trimmings in its pocket so it can weave them into ropes for its _animate rope_ spell-like ability.
