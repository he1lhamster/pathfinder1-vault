##### Description

Chalicotheriums are massive creatures resembling

sloths with vaguely equine heads and long forelimbs

ending in wickedly sharp claws. While the size and the

claws of these creatures make them seem fierce, they are

generally docile animals and become aggressive only in

the defense of their homes and offspring. They typically

f ight only until the invaders

have f led, but if their young are

threatened, they will not relent

until the attacker is dead, even

if they must pursue it for a great

distance to be sure.

These herbivorous creatures

are generally

found alone

or in pairs,

along with any

of their young.

A typical adult

chalicotherium is

about 10 feet tall at

the shoulder and 12

feet long from nose

to rump, and weighs

14,000 pounds.
