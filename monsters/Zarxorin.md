special_abilities:
  Freeze (Ex): A zarxorin that has used its hill retreat ability appears to be a large
    earthen mound with a ring of standing stones around its crown, and it can take
    20 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as a hill or rock. A zarxorin that
    has spent at least 10 years within its hill becomes covered with vegetation and
    nests for wildlife, gaining an additional +10 bonus on this Stealth check until
    it ends its hill retreat.
  Hill Retreat (Ex): As a move action, a zarxorin can withdraw its body into the hump
    on its back to protect itself from danger and increase its connection to deep
    power within the earth. The zarxorin gains a +8 bonus on saving throws and to
    CMD against drag, bull rush, pull, or push attempts and against any other effect
    that would physically move it from its position. The zarxorin also gains a +8
    enhancement bonus to its natural armor, although this benefit does not apply against
    attacks made by creatures that the zarxorin has swallowed whole. While in its
    hill retreat, a zarxorin cannot take any action except to end the retreat or to
    use its joggle ability. The zarxorin recovers 1 point in its menhir focus pool
    for each year it spends using this ability. The zarxorin can end its retreat as
    a move action.
  Joggle (Ex): As a full-round action, a zarxorin can rapidly shake its bulk to scatter
    its foes and churn the ground; all creatures in the zarxorin's space or adjacent
    to it that are at least three sizes smaller than the zarxorin take 5d6 points
    of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 40 negates); creatures that take damage from
    the zarxorin's joggle are pushed to the nearest unoccupied square and fall prone.
    The zarxorin's space and all adjacent spaces thereafter become difficult terrain.
    The save DC is Strength-based.
  Menhir Focus Pool (Su): The standing stones on a zarxorin's back gather latent power
    from the earth into a menhir focus pool that the zarxorin can use to create a
    variety of powerful effects. The pool contains a maximum number of points equal
    to the zarxorin's Hit Dice (28 for most zarxorins), although a zarxorin is typically
    encountered with only 1d10+10 points in its menhir focus pool due to the slow
    rate at which they are recovered. A zarxorin can spend these points as noted below,
    but cannot spend more than 2 points from its menhir focus pool each round. A zarxorin
    can recover points in its menhir focus pool only through use of its hill retreat
    ability. The save DCs are Strength-based. As a free action, a zarxorin can expend
    1 point from its menhir focus pool when it strikes an opponent with a slam attack
    to stun the opponent for 1d6 rounds (Fortitude DC 40 reduces the duration of the
    stun effect to only 1 round).As a swift action, a zarxorin can expend 1 point
    from its menhir focus pool to calcify a creature that it has swallowed whole,
    as per flesh to stone (Fortitude DC 40 negates).As a move action, a zarxorin can
    spend 2 points from its menhir focus pool to unleash a blast of power that deals
    20d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures in a 300-foot-radius burst
    (Reflex DC 40 half) other than the zarxorin; creatures that take damage from this
    effect are slowed (as per the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds.
  Stony Stomach (Ex): A zarxorin's stony interior makes it difficult for creatures
    it has swallowed to escape. Its stomach gains a +4 bonus to AC and has double
    the normal hit points when determining the success of a creature attempting to
    cut its way free.
desc_long: |-
  A zarxorin is an immense, humanoid-shaped elemental with a vast hummock of rock and earth across its back like an enormous shell. Several weathered menhirs protrude from its back, resembling a circle of standing stones. The creatures are prone to long bouts of hibernation, during which they connect to the ley lines and energy sources of the deep earth and slowly gather power in their standing stones. A hibernating zarxorin is often mistaken for a hill, its standing stones believed to be evidence of some ancient, sacred site. Humanoids can live peacefully near one of these “druid hills” for decades, only to be flabbergasted when the hill suddenly rises up and lumbers away.

  Zarxorins engage in short stretches of exploration between their long rests, treading doggedly across mountain ranges or through underground caverns. They are by nature pugnacious, likely to swat away anyone in their path, and they rarely back down from a fight. Although zarxorins have no need to eat, they have a vast, stony stomach and can swallow smaller creatures whole, grinding them up within their cavernous bellies.

  A zarxorin is 75 feet tall and weighs more than 10,000 tons.

##### Description

A _zarxorin_ is an immense, humanoid-shaped elemental with a vast hummock of rock and earth across its back like an enormous shell. Several weathered menhirs protrude from its back, resembling a circle of standing stones. The creatures are _prone_ to long bouts of hibernation, during which they connect to the ley lines and energy sources of the deep earth and slowly gather power in their standing stones. A hibernating _zarxorin_ is often mistaken for a hill, its standing stones believed to be evidence of some ancient, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sacred|sacred]]_ site. Humanoids can live peacefully near one of these “_[[classes/Druid|druid]]_ hills” for decades, only to be flabbergasted when the hill suddenly rises up and lumbers away.

Zarxorins engage in short stretches of exploration between their long rests, treading doggedly across mountain ranges or through underground caverns. They are by nature pugnacious, likely to swat away anyone in their path, and they rarely back down from a fight. Although zarxorins have no need to eat, they have a vast, stony stomach and can swallow smaller creatures whole, _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Grinding|grinding]]_ them up within their cavernous bellies.

A _zarxorin_ is 75 feet tall and weighs more than 10,000 tons.
