  Adhesive (Su): A weapon that strikes an adherer becomes stuck fast to the creature's
    adhesive flesh unless the wielder succeeds at a DC 14 Reflex save. A creature
    adjacent to the adherer can attempt to pry off a stuck weapon with a DC 17 Strength
    check, but doing so provokes an attack of opportunity from the adherer. The adherer's
    adhesive flesh gives it a +8 racial bonus on grapple checks. It can attempt to
    grapple a foe without spending an action whenever a creature successfully hits
    it with a natural attack or an unarmed strike. An adherer does not gain the grappled
    condition when it grapples a foe, nor does it provoke attacks of opportunity when
    it attempts to do so. Fire can temporarily burn away an adherer's adhesive coating-whenever
    an adherer takes at least 10 points of fire damage, it loses its adhesive special
    quality for 1d4 rounds. Universal solvent, alchemical solvent, or a similar fluid
    removes an adherer's adhesive quality for 1 hour if it fails a DC 15 Reflex save,
    or for 1d4 rounds if it makes the save. The adherer's skin loses its adhesive
    quality 1 hour after the adherer dies. An adherer can release anything stuck to
    it as a free action. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
  Adherers look vaguely like embalmed and mummified corpses wrapped in dirty linen, but they are in fact otherworldly beings of an entirely different nature. Transformed by hideous processes on the Ethereal Plane, their bodies are riddled with tiny, adhesive strands that can stick to anything, allowing adherers to bind their enemies' weapons and capture living creatures for their depraved rituals.

  Though once human, adherers have forgotten all traces of humanity, and now hunt their former kindred with gleeful abandon. Adherers digest food unusually slowly, and as such can feed on a single creature (humans are their favorite meal) for days or even weeks, taking only one or two bites a day and forcing their living captives to endure a hellish, drawn-out death.

The _adherer_’s skin loses its _adhesive_ quality 1 hour after the _adherer_ dies. An _adherer_ can release anything stuck to it as a free action. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

##### Description

Adherers look vaguely like embalmed and mummified corpses wrapped in dirty linen, but they are in fact otherworldly beings of an entirely different nature. Transformed by hideous processes on the Ethereal Plane, their bodies are riddled with tiny, _adhesive_ strands that can stick to anything, allowing adherers to bind their enemies’ weapons and capture living creatures for their depraved rituals.

Though once human, adherers have forgotten all traces of humanity, and now hunt their former kindred with gleeful abandon. Adherers digest food unusually slowly, and as such can feed on a single creature (humans are their favorite meal) for days or even weeks, taking only one or two bites a day and forcing their living captives to endure a hellish, drawn-out death.
