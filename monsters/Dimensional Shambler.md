  Dimension Mastery (Ex): A dimensional shambler can take actions normally after using
    dimension door effects. A dimensional shambler under the effects of a dimensional
    anchor or dimensional lock spell can ignore the effects of the spell for 1 round
    by making a DC 25 Knowledge (planes) check as a move action.
  Resist Conjuration (Ex): Dimensional shamblers detest being conjured by other creatures.
    They are immune to all spell effects of the summoning school, and are treated
    as if they had double their actual Hit Dice (18 HD for most dimensional shamblers)
    for the purposes of determining if they can be conjured by spells like planar
    ally or planar binding.
  Shift Planes (Su): A dimensional shambler can shift between planes once per hour,
    using an effect that is similar to that created by the plane shift spell, save
    that a dimensional shambler is a master of such travel and can manifest at an
    exact location on its destination plane if it makes a DC 20 Knowledge (planes)
    check. If it exceeds this DC by 10 or more, it can place itself in such a position
    upon arrival that if combat immediately results from its appearance, it gains
    a +10 bonus on its resulting initiative check. Using shift planes is a full-round
    action that provokes attacks of opportunity, during which the dimensional shambler
    shimmers and grows increasingly transparent. A dimensional shambler can use this
    ability while grappling a creature-doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity
    from the creature it is grappling. If the creature is of the dimensional shambler's
    size or smaller (Medium for most dimensional shamblers), that creature shifts
    planes with the dimensional shambler unless it makes a DC 15 Will save. The save
    DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  The dimensional shambler is a vagabond of the realms between realms. With its ability to shift planes, it is no stranger to the weirdest the Great Beyond has to offer, and despite its brutish and unrefined intellect, its knowledge of the planes and the relationships between dimensions is significant indeed.

  A dimensional shambler is humanoid in outline, yet it moves with a weird and alien gait that gives it the appearance of a creature not in full possession of its faculties, almost as if it were drunk or horribly wounded. Yet those who mistake this shambling posture as a sign of weakness swiftly learn of their error, for the dimensional shambler is in fact quite agile-the weird lumbering cadence of its movements is simply another outward manifestation of its inhuman countenance.

  A dimensional shambler typically stands just over 7 feet in height, and weighs 350 pounds.

##### Description

The _dimensional shambler_ is a vagabond of the realms between realms. With its ability to shift planes, it is no stranger to the weirdest the Great Beyond has to offer, and despite its brutish and unrefined intellect, its knowledge of the planes and the relationships between dimensions is significant indeed.

A _dimensional shambler_ is humanoid in outline, yet it moves with a _[[spells/Weird|weird]]_ and alien gait that gives it the appearance of a creature not in full _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_ of its faculties, almost as if it were drunk or horribly wounded. Yet those who mistake this shambling posture as a sign of weakness swiftly learn of their error, for the _dimensional shambler_ is in fact quite _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Agile|agile]]_—the _weird_ lumbering cadence of its movements is simply another outward manifestation of its inhuman countenance.

A _dimensional shambler_ typically stands just over 7 feet in height, and weighs 350 pounds.
