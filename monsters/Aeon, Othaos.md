  Banish Darkness (Su): An othaos in an area of dim light or darkness (including supernatural
    darkness) can radiate intense light and heat. The light level in the square the
    othaos occupies increases by two levels for 1 round and the light level in all
    adjacent squares increases by one level. Apply this adjustment after determining
    the light level from all other sources (adjusting to include spells cast after
    the othaos uses this ability). All creatures adjacent to the othaos take 4d6 points
    of fire damage (Will DC 15 half). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Chiaroscuro (Su): An othaos aeon's physical form changes depending on the level
    of light present in its space. While in areas of dim light or darkness (as well
    as supernatural darkness), an othaos becomes invisible and gains the incorporeal
    subtype. While incorporeal, an othaos has no Strength score, can't make natural
    attacks, and loses its natural armor bonus (giving it a total AC of 16).
  Consume Light (Su): As a standard action, an othaos in an area of normal or bright
    light can consume the light and heat around its body. The light level in the square
    the othaos occupies drops by two levels for 1 round and the light level in all
    adjacent squares drops by one level. Apply this adjustment after determining the
    light level from all other sources (adjusting further to include spells cast after
    the othaos uses this ability). All creatures adjacent to the othaos take 4d6 points
    of cold damage (Will DC 15 half). The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: Enigmatic and ephemeral, othaoses are stewards of the balance between light
  and darkness. Othaoses seek out supernatural sources of light and dark that unnaturally
  prolong exposure to one or the other and work to restore the natural order. They
  may be encountered studying sources of light or observing large objects casting
  shadows-they're just as likely to assist in the repair of a light source as they
  are to seek the destruction of an object casting too much shadow. These aeons also
  scout for breaches between the Material Plane and the Plane of Shadow, seeking to
  mend these rifts whenever possible.

The light level in the square the othaos occupies increases by two levels for 1 round and the light level in all adjacent squares increases by one level. Apply this adjustment after determining the light level from all other sources (adjusting to include spells cast after the othaos uses this ability). All creatures adjacent to the othaos take 4d6 points of fire damage (Will DC 15 half). The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Chiaroscuro (Su)** An othaos aeon’s physical form changes depending on the level of light present in its space. While in areas of dim light or _darkness_ (as well as supernatural _darkness_), an othaos becomes _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ and gains the _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ subtype. While _incorporeal_, an othaos has no Strength score, can’t make _[[universal monster rules/Natural Attacks|natural attacks]]_, and loses its natural armor bonus (giving it a total AC of 16).

**Consume Light (Su)** As a standard action, an othaos in an area of normal or bright light can consume the light and _heat_ around its body. The light level in the square the othaos occupies drops by two levels for 1 round and the light level in all adjacent squares drops by one level. Apply this adjustment after determining the light level from all other sources (adjusting further to include spells cast after the othaos uses this ability).

##### Description

Enigmatic and ephemeral, othaoses are stewards of the balance between light and _darkness_. Othaoses seek out supernatural sources of light and dark that unnaturally prolong exposure to one or the other and work to restore the natural order. They may be encountered studying sources of light or observing large objects casting shadows—they’re just as likely to assist in the repair of a light source as they are to seek the _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ of an object casting too much _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|shadow]]_. These aeons also scout for breaches between the Material Plane and the Plane of _Shadow_, seeking to mend these rifts whenever possible.
