### Special Abilities

**Hypoxic Domain (Su)** A mountain _blight_’s cursed domain is always treated as being one altitude zone higher than its actual zone would otherwise indicate, so areas that would normally function as a low pass zone (lower than 5,000 feet) function as low peak or high pass (5,000 to 15,000 feet), and areas that normally function as low peak or high pass instead function as high peak (higher than 15,000 feet). If the mountain _blight_’s cursed domain is already located in an area counted as a high peak, the effects of altitude sickness manifest immediately rather than after a 6-hour period spent in the area. Furthermore, as soon as a creature fails a Fortitude save against this effect, it suffers the effects of _[[spells/Slow|slow]]_ _[[spells/Suffocation|suffocation]]_, as detailed on page 445 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. Characters in these zones must attempt regular Fortitude saves to avoid suffering from fatigue and other effects of altitude sickness, as detailed on page 430 of the Core Rulebook. A mountain _blight_ is always considered to be acclimated to its domain and never suffers ill effects from this ability, and it can select creatures within this domain to be similarly protected as a free action.

**Powerful Slam (Ex)** A mountain _blight_ applies one and a half times its Strength modifier to slam damage.

**Tremors (Su)** As a swift action up to three times per day but no more often than once every 1d4 rounds, a mountain _blight_ may cause the ground in a 60-foot radius around it to shake and shudder, as if from a localized _[[spells/Earthquake|earthquake]]_. All creatures standing in this area must succeed at a DC 26 Reflex save or fall _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_. These tremors are not strong enough to damage buildings. Creatures that can’t be tripped are immune to this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

Most mountain blights inhabit rocky peaks or sheer cliffs on Material Plane worlds. Unlike the others of their kind, mountain blights are not as aggressive in seeking bastions of civilization to destroy, yet their penchant for picking well-traveled mountain passes as their domains ensures they have access to a constant influx of travelers and other victims to prey upon.

A mountain _blight_ averages 6 feet in diameter and weighs around 270 pounds.
