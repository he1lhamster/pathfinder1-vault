  Create Spawn (Su): Any humanoid creature that is slain by a marrowstone golem rises
    from death as a free-willed ghoul in 24 hours. A creature with four or more class
    levels rises as a ghast instead. In either case, the ghoul or ghast has a 25%
    chance of retaining whatever class levels it had in life.
  Immunity to Magic (Su): A marrowstone golem is immune to any spell or spell-like
    ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects
    function differently against the golem, as noted below. A transmute rock to mud
    spell slows a marrowstone golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving
    throw.Effects that heal undead heal half that amount of damage to a marrowstone
    golem, to a limit of its full normal hit points.A marrowstone golem that fails
    its save against a magical attack that deals positive energy damage (including
    the channel energy ability when used to harm undead, but not when used to heal
    living creatures) does not take any damage from the attack, but it loses its create
    spawn ability, its necrotic field aura, and the negative energy damage from its
    slam attack for 1d4 rounds.
  Necrotic Field (Su): Undead within 30 feet of a marrowstone golem gain a +2 resistance
    bonus on saving throws, increase the save DCs of their extraordinary and supernatural
    abilities by 2, and gain a +4 bonus to channel resistance. Positive energy effects
    cause only half damage to a creature within the marrowstone golem's aura. Their
    aura particularly strengthens ghouls and ghasts, giving them a +2 bonus on attack
    and weapon damage rolls.
desc_long: Carved from rock hewn from the marrowstone mines of Sekamina, these golems
  amplify the magical radiation emitted by veins of lazurite. They can only be crafted
  within the necropolis of Nemret Noktoria, land of ghouls, for lazurite brought beyond
  its boundaries loses its potency. Binding the lazurite into the body of the golem
  stabilizes it and lets the construct leave the boundaries of the ghoulish city with
  its fell powers intact. Though the ghouls guard the secrets of making a marrowstone
  golem, they are sometimes known to trade their handiwork with outsiders.
