special_abilities:
  Black Coral Secretion (Ex): An incutilis lord's tentacles generate an oily black
    residue that quickly hardens into a dense, coral-like substance. A single application
    covers a 5 foot square and completely hardens in 1 minute, even when exposed to
    water. This substance is malleable until hardened, allowing an incutilis lord
    or the lord's minions to shape it into armor, walls, and more. Once calcified,
    it has a hardness of 4 and 8 hit points per inch of thickness. An incutilis lord
    can produce one application of black coral per Hit Die each day.
  Calcified Minion (Su): |-
    A calcifying stinger imparts a strong psychic connection between a calcified target and the incutilis lord who implanted the stinger. Once the target succumbs to the incutilis lord's will (see the calcifying sting ability, below), the target's whole body is infused with new secretions that allow the incutilis lord to dictate the target's actions and restore any Dexterity lost to the calcifying sting, as the secretions assist the minion's movement rather than hindering it. The incutilis lord can control a number of minions equal to its Charisma modifier as a free action. If the incutilis lord attempts to control a new minion in excess of this limit, it must first release one of its current calcified minions; see the calcifying sting ability, below. The minions have no will of their own but retain a small portion of their identity, giving the incutilis lord access to their feats, physical skills, extraordinary abilities, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. A calcified creature moves under the direct control of its incutilis lord until the stinger is removed from its body.

     While under the incutilis lord's control, a calcified minion takes its own normal actions each round, as directed by its controller. A minion can survive this process for a number of days equal to its Constitution score. After this time, the calcified minion dies, though its body retains a semblance of life. The dead minion is treated as a living creature and can be controlled in the same fashion as before until the calcifying stinger is removed or the incutilis lord that controls the creature dies.
  Calcifying Sting (Su): |-
    The tentacles of an incutilis lord inject a painful stinger that constantly generates a black coral secretion. A creature stung by an incutilis lord must attempt a DC 19 Fortitude saving throw at the beginning of every turn until the stinger is removed. Each time it fails this save, the creature takes an additional 1d6 points of damage and 2 points of Dexterity drain. If this causes the creature to reach 0 or fewer hit points or a Dexterity score of 0, it loses all will of its own and immediately comes under the control of the incutilis lord (see the calcified minion ability, above).

     As a swift action, the incutilis lord can psychically command one of its stingers to remove itself from a stung creature, releasing its control over that creature. Another creature can forcefully remove a stinger from a willing or unconscious target by a succeeding at a DC 19 Heal check. Regardless of whether this Heal check succeeds or fails, attempting to remove the stinger deals 1d8 points of damage to the target. If the stinger is removed or the incutilis lord dies, the fluid seeps out of the controlled creature's wounds and the creature is released from the incutilis lord's control-though the creature may be dead by that time. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
  The elders of the incutilis race display an unearthly beauty, with vibrant colors and considerable aquatic grace for their size. As these horrors live for hundreds of years in remote aquatic locations, scholars remain unsure whether the lesser incutilises eventually attain this majestic form or are a separate race, and-more worrying-what their relationship is with these ancient aberrations of the deep ocean and the great subterranean seas.

  Incutilis lords attack with barbed tentacles, inflicting a painful sting and injecting a calcifying agent that transforms living tissue into a dense black growth resembling a cross between chitin and coral. The stinger anchors the incutilis lord's senses in a calcified minion, leaving a disturbing exoskeleton that moves the minion about at the monster's whim. Unlike the mindless zombies that serve a more common incutilis, an incutilis lord's servitors retain muscle memory and a grasp of their magical abilities. An incutilis lord can survive for decades by feeding on the body and psyche of a single Mediumsized victim, but rarely settles for having only one minion to manipulate or feed upon.

  An incutilis lord's shell is about 8 feet in diameter, and the aberration measures nearly 20 feet long from the back of the shell to the tips of its longest tentacles. An incutilis lord weighs about 600 pounds.

**Calcified Minion (Su)** A calcifying stinger imparts a strong _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ connection between a calcified target and the _incutilis_ lord who implanted the stinger.

##### Description

The elders of the _incutilis_ race display an unearthly beauty, with vibrant colors and considerable aquatic _[[spells/Grace|grace]]_ for their size. As these horrors live for hundreds of years in remote aquatic locations, scholars remain unsure whether the lesser incutilises eventually attain this majestic form or are a separate race, and—more worrying—what their relationship is with these ancient aberrations of the deep ocean and the great subterranean seas.

_Incutilis_ lords attack with barbed tentacles, inflicting a painful sting and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Injecting|injecting]]_ a calcifying agent that transforms living tissue into a dense black growth resembling a cross between chitin and coral. The stinger anchors the _incutilis_ lord’s senses in a calcified minion, leaving a disturbing exoskeleton that moves the minion about at the monster’s whim. Unlike the mindless zombies that serve a more common _incutilis_, an _incutilis_ lord’s servitors retain muscle memory and a _[[spells/Grasp|grasp]]_ of their magical abilities. An _incutilis_ lord can survive for decades by feeding on the body and psyche of a single Mediumsized victim, but rarely settles for having only one minion to manipulate or feed upon.

An _incutilis_ lord’s shell is about 8 feet in diameter, and the aberration measures nearly 20 feet long from the back of the shell to the tips of its longest tentacles. An _incutilis_ lord weighs about 600 pounds.
