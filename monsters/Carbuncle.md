special_abilities:
  Empath (Su): Carbuncles possess a crude form of telepathy, allowing them to transmit
    mild impressions and remembered sensations to other creatures. This form of telepathy
    cannot convey language or hinder a target in any way (such as by transmitting
    pain). Thus, a carbuncle can relate a feeling of fear or the faint smell of leaves,
    but cannot directly warn an ally of a monster or tell of a treasure under a dirt
    mound.
  Fatal Faker (Su): As a standard action three times per day, a carbuncle can teleport
    as per the spell dimension door, but only within a range of 30 feet. Upon teleporting,
    the carbuncle leaves behind a perfect replica of itself amid a colored flash and
    the sound of a reptilian choke. This replica duplicates the carbuncle in all ways,
    though it is obviously dead and the colorless stone in its head is reduced to
    worthless dust.
  Specious Suggestion (Su): As a standard action three times per day, a carbuncle
    can concentrate intently on one creature within its line of sight and attempt
    to impose its will upon the target. A DC 11 Will save is enough to resist this
    compulsion. If the target fails to resist, roll 1d6. On a result of 1-2, the target
    gains a flash of insight and a +2 insight bonus to its Armor Class for 1 minute.
    On a result of 3-4, the victim is affected as if by suggestion for 1 minute, and
    must follow a single (usually embarrassing, always harmless) suggestion from the
    carbuncle. On a result of 5-6, the victim's thoughts are garbled with those of
    the carbuncle, imposing a -2 penalty to the victim's Will saving throws for 1
    minute. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Vulnerability to Suggestion (Ex): Any mind-affecting spell can affect a carbuncle
    regardless of creature type limitations. A spell like charm person, for example,
    which typically only affects humanoid creatures, can also affect carbuncles.
desc_long: |-
  Never have legend and misinformation met upon a more inauspicious brow than that of the lowly carbuncle. Even the creature's name summons ideas that range from the grandiose to the grotesque. Carbuncles appear to be little more than ungainly reptiles. What sets them apart, however, is their strange magical abilities and the fist-sized gemstone horn jutting from above their bulging eyes. Although tales differ regarding the type and value of the stone, many claim it is a ruby or garnet. In truth, however, a carbuncle's gem is merely a highly reflective growth, not unlike a fingernail.

  Carbuncles exhibit a peculiar attraction to magic-users, especially sorcerers with the fey bloodline and any who pack supplies of fresh fruit. Many enchanters laud the extraordinary mind-control powers of these intense creatures and extol the aid they can offer mages of their field-though others consider such tales something of an academic in-joke.

  A neutral spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can gain a carbuncle as a familiar at 5th level.

##### Description

Never have legend and misinformation met upon a more inauspicious brow than that of the lowly _carbuncle_. Even the creature’s name summons ideas that range from the grandiose to the grotesque. Carbuncles appear to be little more than ungainly reptiles. What sets them apart, however, is their strange magical abilities and the fist-sized gemstone horn jutting from above their bulging eyes. Although tales differ regarding the type and value of the stone, many claim it is a ruby or garnet. In truth, however, a _carbuncle_’s gem is merely a highly reflective growth, not unlike a fingernail.

Carbuncles exhibit a peculiar attraction to magic-users, especially sorcerers with the fey bloodline and any who pack supplies of fresh fruit. Many enchanters laud the extraordinary mind-control powers of these intense creatures and extol the aid they can offer mages of their field—though others consider such tales something of an academic in-joke.

A neutral spellcaster with the _[[feats/Improved Familiar|Improved Familiar]]_ feat can gain a _carbuncle_ as a familiar at 5th level.
