  Acid (Ex): A giant sundew secretes a potent, flesh-eating acid that quickly dissolves
    most organic material but does not affect metal or stone.
  Adhesive (Ex): A giant sundew's body exudes a sticky adhesive, holding fast any
    creatures or items that touch it. A giant sundew automatically grapples any creature
    it hits with its slam attack. Opponents so grappled cannot get free while the
    sundew is alive without first removing the adhesive. A weapon that strikes a giant
    sundew is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds at a DC 23 Reflex save. A successful
    DC 20 Strength check is needed to pry off a stuck weapon. Strong alcohol or universal
    solvent dissolves the adhesive, but the giant sundew can still grapple normally.
    The substance breaks down naturally 5 rounds after a sundew dies and is rendered
    inert for 1 round immediately after the giant sundew takes 10 or more points of
    cold damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Stupefaction Pollen (Ex): Once per day, the first time a giant sundew has fewer
    than half its hit points (76 or fewer for the typical giant sundew), it releases
    a transparent cloud of pollen; this effect happens automatically and does not
    require an action of any sort on the giant sundew's behalf. The pollen cloud fills
    the area in a 20-foot radius around the giant sundew. All creatures caught in
    the area of effect must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of
    Intelligence damage and be staggered for 1d4 rounds.
desc_long: |-
  Unlike its smaller, insect-eating cousin, a giant sundew actively seeks out prey using its shallow but sturdy roots to slowly pull itself through its boggy environs. When a giant sundew attacks, it does so by slamming targets with its thick, leaflike fronds, each of which is covered with globules of sticky, acidic goo. The giant sundew exudes an unmistakable scent of honey-an attractive odor that often proves irresistible to nearby creatures. 

  Although the giant sundew is not quite a mindless monstrosity, its intellect is barely more than instinctive, and it has little ability to discern between allies and enemies. If it attacks a creature that is immune to acid or adhesive qualities, the sundew is smart enough to avoid attacking that foe in future rounds (although it continues to slam such targets with its fronds in self defense, if needed). Despite sundews' inability to form alliances, many more intelligent forest-dwelling creatures take advantage of the sticky plants and use them as organic traps to help gather prey. Will-o'-wisps in particular are quite fond of the methods a sundew uses to capture and consume prey, for the anguish and fear of creatures stuck to a plant that is slowly dissolving and digesting them form quite a delicious tonic of horror for the wisps to feed upon. 

  A full-grown giant sundew can reach a height of over 20 feet and weighs 4,000 pounds.

##### Description

Unlike its smaller, insect-eating cousin, a _giant sundew_ actively seeks out prey using its shallow but sturdy roots to slowly _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ itself through its boggy environs. When a _giant sundew_ attacks, it does so by slamming targets with its thick, leaflike fronds, each of which is covered with globules of _sticky_, acidic goo. The _giant sundew_ exudes an unmistakable _[[universal monster rules/Scent|scent]]_ of honey—an attractive odor that often proves irresistible to nearby creatures.

Although the _giant sundew_ is not quite a mindless monstrosity, its intellect is barely more than instinctive, and it has little ability to discern between allies and enemies. If it attacks a creature that is immune to acid or _adhesive_ qualities, the sundew is smart enough to avoid attacking that foe in future rounds (although it continues to slam such targets with its fronds in self defense, if needed). Despite sundews’ inability to form alliances, many more intelligent forest-dwelling creatures take advantage of the _sticky_ plants and use them as organic traps to help gather prey. Will-o’-wisps in particular are quite fond of the methods a sundew uses to capture and consume prey, for the anguish and _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ of creatures stuck to a plant that is slowly dissolving and digesting them form quite a delicious tonic of horror for the wisps to feed upon.

A full-grown _giant sundew_ can reach a height of over 20 feet and weighs 4,000 pounds.
