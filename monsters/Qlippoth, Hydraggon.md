  Beacon (Su): Once per day as an immediate action, a hydraggon can emit a telepathic
    warning of danger to all hydraggons in a 100-mile radius. A qlippoth that receives
    this warning during or just before an initiative check gains a +4 bonus on that
    check.
  Bite (Ex): A hydraggon cannot make a bite attack during a round in which it uses
    its tongue to attack (either with weapons or as a secondary tongue attack).
  Cloud Memory (Su): When a hydraggon hits a creature with its tongue or bite attack,
    the target must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have its memories clouded for
    1d6 rounds (the creature takes a -3 penalty on this save if it was bitten instead
    of being struck by a tongue). During this time, the creature takes a -2 penalty
    on all attack rolls and skill checks, and it cannot use thought components when
    casting psychic spells. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Horrific Appearance (Su): A creature that succumbs to a hydraggon's horrific appearance
    becomes distracted by the monster's slithering coils and undulating tongues, and
    takes a -4 penalty on Perception checks and ranged attacks for 1d6 rounds.
  Tongue (Ex): A hydraggon's strange tongue splits into three tentacles, each of which
    is capable of feats of manipulation equal to that of a human hand. A hydraggon
    can wield weapons in these tongues, but if it wields more than one weapon, it
    must fight as if using the two-weapon fighting option. Although most hydraggons
    opt to wield a one-handed weapon and a light weapon, some choose instead to wield
    a two-handed weapon and a one-handed or light weapon- doing so uses all three
    of its tongues and doesn't leave one free to make a tongue attack. When a hydraggon
    wields a two-handed weapon in this manner, it takes a -4 penalty on attacks with
    the two-handed weapon and a -8 penalty on attacks with its “off-hand” weapon.
    If a hydraggon has a free tongue, it can use it to make a secondary natural attack
    that deals 1d3 points of bludgeoning damage and clouds a victim's memory (see
    above).
desc_long: |-
  The hydraggon is a strange qlippoth that has mastered the use of weapons, despite its lack of hands. These creatures enjoy swimming in the waters of the River Styx, and their immunity to mind-affecting effects shields them from the river's memory draining properties. 

  A hydraggon is 7 feet long and weighs 200 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**Beacon (Su)** Once per day as an immediate action, a hydraggon can emit a telepathic warning of danger to all hydraggons in a 100-mile radius. A qlippoth that receives this warning during or just before an initiative check gains a +4 bonus on that check.

**Cloud Memory (Su)** When a hydraggon hits a creature with its tongue or bite attack, the target must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have its memories clouded for 1d6 rounds (the creature takes a –3 penalty on this save if it was bitten instead of being struck by a tongue). During this time, the creature takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls and skill checks, and it cannot use thought components when casting _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ spells. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Horrific Appearance (Su)** A creature that succumbs to a hydraggon’s horrific appearance becomes distracted by the monster’s _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Slithering|slithering]]_ coils and undulating _tongues_, and takes a –4 penalty on Perception checks and ranged attacks for 1d6 rounds.

**Tongue (Ex)** A hydraggon’s strange tongue splits into three tentacles, each of which is capable of feats of manipulation equal to that of a human hand. A hydraggon can wield weapons in these _tongues_, but if it wields more than one weapon, it must fight as if using the _two-weapon fighting_ option. Although most hydraggons opt to wield a one-handed weapon and a light weapon, some choose instead to wield a two-handed weapon and a one-handed or light weapon— doing so uses all three of its _tongues_ and doesn’t leave one free to make a tongue attack. When a hydraggon wields a two-handed weapon in this manner, it takes a –4 penalty on attacks with the two-handed weapon and a –8 penalty on attacks with its “off-hand” weapon. If a hydraggon has a free tongue, it can use it to make a secondary natural attack that deals 1d3 points of bludgeoning damage and clouds a victim’s memory (see above).

##### Description

The hydraggon is a strange qlippoth that has mastered the use of weapons, despite its lack of hands. These creatures enjoy swimming in the waters of the River Styx, and their _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to mind-affecting effects shields them from the river’s memory draining properties.

A hydraggon is 7 feet long and weighs 200 pounds.
