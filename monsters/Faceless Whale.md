  Blind (Ex): A faceless whale sees and senses exclusively through its blindsight
    ability, which is based on sound and movement-beyond 150 feet, the whale is considered
    blind. A deafened faceless whale is effectively blinded as well. It is invulnerable
    to all sight-based effects and attacks, including gaze attacks.
  Resonant Song (Su): As a standard action, a faceless whale can focus a 60-foot ray
    of sonic energy on a single target that deals 8d6 points of damage. This ray deals
    normal damage to objects, but is still subject to hardness. Alternatively, a faceless
    whale can blast this resonant energy in a 60- foot cone. Creatures in this area
    must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Any submerged
    creature holding its breath must succeed at a second Fortitude saving throw at
    the same DC or it has its breath knocked out of it and instantly begins drowning.
desc_long: |-
  Called “ansiktsloshvals” in Aklo, and sometimes called “Darklands whales,” faceless whales are enigmatic predators of the Sightless Sea rarely encountered elsewhere on Golarion. Like cavefish, faceless whales lost their eyes and pigmentation from countless generations spent living and breeding in the lightless depths. The lack of pigmentation leaves the creatures' skin little more than a transparent, blubberlined film, with pulsing veins and churning organs visible beneath the silvery membrane. Sailors' lore from the Sightless Sea claims a faceless whale's most recent meal shows through the taut skin of its belly.

  It is unknown precisely how long faceless whales have inhabited the Sightless Sea. Some legends claim faceless whales began their lives as normal toothed whales that washed into the Darklands during the cataclysm of Earthfall, if not long before. Darker tales contend the faceless whales were driven into the realm of Orv by a coven of powerful sea hags, who robbed the faceless whales of their sight when they refused to teach the hags their potent song.

  An adult faceless whale is 70 feet long and weights 90,000 pounds, though some specimens stretch these averages and grow half again as large.

##### Description

_[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|Called]]_ “ansiktsloshvals” in Aklo, and sometimes _called_ “Darklands whales,” faceless whales are enigmatic predators of the Sightless Sea rarely encountered elsewhere on Golarion. Like cavefish, faceless whales lost their eyes and pigmentation from countless generations spent living and breeding in the lightless depths. The lack of pigmentation leaves the creatures’ skin little more than a transparent, blubberlined film, with pulsing veins and churning organs visible beneath the silvery membrane. Sailors’ lore from the Sightless Sea claims a _faceless whale_’s most recent meal shows through the taut skin of its belly.

It is _[[monsters/Unknown|unknown]]_ precisely how long faceless whales have inhabited the Sightless Sea. Some legends claim faceless whales began their lives as normal toothed whales that washed into the Darklands during the cataclysm of Earthfall, if not long before. Darker tales contend the faceless whales were driven into the realm of Orv by a coven of powerful sea hags, who robbed the faceless whales of their sight when they refused to teach the hags their _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ song.

An adult _faceless whale_ is 70 feet long and weights 90,000 pounds, though some specimens stretch these averages and grow half again as large.
