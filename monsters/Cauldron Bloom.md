# Cauldron Bloom
Three thick vines sprout from this massive cylindrical plant’s

base. Ruddy light flickers beneath its sloping armored sides, and

it exudes a palpable aura of magic.

### Special Abilities
**Sanguine Centrifuge (Su)** Creatures that enter, or begin their

turn within, the _[[monsters/Cauldron Bloom|cauldron bloom]]_’s stomach take 2d8+16 points

of bludgeoning damage plus 3d6 _bleed_ as spinning arcane

currents force the blood from their bodies. This _bleed_ cannot

be stopped while the creature is within the _cauldron bloom_’s

stomach. Corpses of creatures slain by this damage are torn

apart, as _[[spells/Disintegrate|disintegrate]]_. Furthermore, creatures within the

stomach must succeed at a DC 23 Reflex save to maintain

control while caught in the currents or be _[[conditions/Nauseated|nauseated]]_ for

1 round; creatures with _[[spells/Freedom of Movement|freedom of movement]]_ are still

affected but gain a +4 bonus on the saving throw. The save

DC is Charisma-based. This otherwise functions as the swallow

whole ability, with the following changes: a _cauldron bloom_

can simultaneously hold up to one Gargantuan creature, two

Huge creatures, four Large creatures, and so forth; swallowed

creatures can use any of their available attacks to cut

themselves free; and after a swallowed creature has cut itself

free, the _cauldron bloom_ can continue to teleport creatures

into its stomach with its warping field ability, but it receives

a cumulative –2 penalty to its ability DCs for each time a

creature has cut its way out.

**Terraforming Teleport (Sp)** A _cauldron bloom_’s greater

teleport spell-like ability has a range of 1 mile, and the

destination must be within enough stone, soil, sand, or

similar material to surround the _cauldron bloom_’s body. The

material the _cauldron bloom_ will occupy is in turn teleported

to backfill the cavity left by the creature’s departure. If a

_cauldron bloom_ attempts to teleport to an invalid location,

the ability fails with no effect.

**Warping Field (Su)** A _cauldron bloom_ draws prey close with

_[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ arcane strands, which it projects in one of two forms:

diffuse or targeted. Projecting diffuse strands is a swift action,

and forces each creature within 120 feet of the _[[items/Mundane/Cauldron|cauldron]]_

bloom to attempt a DC 23 Reflex save. A creature that fails

the save is teleported 60 feet toward the _cauldron bloom_;

if this would bring a creature or object within 30 feet of the

_cauldron bloom_, it is instead teleported into the _cauldron_

bloom’s stomach. Projecting targeted strands is a standard

action and forces one creature within 360 feet to attempt

a DC 23 Fortitude save. If the creature fails, it is teleported

into the _cauldron bloom_’s stomach. Targets must be at least

one size category smaller than the _cauldron bloom_, and this

ability attempts to teleport the closest creature first. A creature

cannot be teleported into the _cauldron bloom_ if it would

not fit, as noted above. Creatures affected by effects that

block extradimensional travel, such as _[[spells/Dimensional Lock|dimensional lock]]_, are

immune to this ability. Both save DCs are Charisma-based.

##### Description

_Cauldron_ blooms are immense, slow-moving subterranean

plants that maintain their arcane metabolisms by

consuming massive quantities of blood. They dwell in

cold environs, typically along the migration routes of

herd animals, and slowly teleport to new locations in

search of food. Feeding _cauldron_ blooms generally erupt

from the ground in the midst of such herds. The animals’

_[[conditions/Panicked|panicked]]_ cries are cut short when the terrified individuals

wink out of existence, reappearing a moment later inside

the _cauldron bloom_’s otherworldly guts. Arcane winds

within the _cauldron bloom_’s stomach rapidly draw the

blood from ingested prey, shred their bodies, and leave

nothing behind. A particularly hungry _cauldron bloom_

can systematically consume entire herds of animals, or

_[[spells/Sequester|sequester]]_ one individual—such as an unlucky giant

or megafauna—inside its stomach. The prey’s blood

fuels the plant’s magical physiology, casting flickering

arcane light as it distributes throughout the _cauldron_

bloom’s body.

Typically, _cauldron_ blooms live for hundreds of years.

Their bodies are around 15 feet in diameter and weigh

upward of 80 tons.
