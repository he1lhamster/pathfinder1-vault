    attack. If the troop succeeds at demoralizing a shaken or frightened foe, the
    foe's fear level increases by one step.
  Mounted Troop (Ex): A yzobu rider troop deals triple its troop damage if it moves
    at least 10 feet before making a troop attack. The hobgoblins in this troop are
    Medium creatures, but the troop can fit only through areas that would accommodate
    their Large mounts.
  Volley (Ex): A yzobu rider troop can fire a volley of arrows as a standard action.
    This attack takes the form of up to four lines with a range of 100 feet. These
    lines can start from the corner of any square in the troop's space. Creatures
    in any of these lines take 8d8 points of piercing damage (Reflex DC 27 half).
