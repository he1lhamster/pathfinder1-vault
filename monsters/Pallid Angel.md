# Pallid Angel
This macabre beauty holds her ebon-feathered wings spread

behind her. Her skin and clothing are soaked and splattered with

blood, wine, and other fluids.

### Special Abilities

**_Bloodbath_ (Su)** Pallid angels are avatars of slaughter,

delighting in the bloody carnality of combat. When a pallid

angel kills a creature using a manufactured melee weapon,

she can splash its blood (or similar remains) on herself

as a free action, even if it’s not her turn. This grants her 8

temporary hit points and a +2 profane bonus to Strength.

These benefits stack with themselves, to a maximum of 40

temporary hit points and a +10 bonus to Strength, and they

last until 1 minute after the _[[monsters/Pallid Angel|pallid angel]]_ last used this ability.

**Hunger for Life and Death (Su)** A _pallid angel_ is healed by

both positive and negative energy. In addition, whenever a

positive energy or negative energy effect would _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ or _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_

one or more creatures within 30 feet, the _pallid angel_ can

consume the energy as an immediate action. The _pallid angel_

regains a number of hit points equal to the greatest amount of

healing or damage a targeted creature would receive, and no

other creatures are affected by the effect. A _pallid angel_ can

consume energy this way three times per day.

**Profane Ward (Su)** A _pallid angel_’s _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_ is

increased by 5 against spells with the good descriptor and

spells cast by worshippers of good-aligned deities.

##### Description

Urgathoa is known best as a goddess of plague and

undeath, yet the Pallid _[[npcs/Princess|Princess]]_ has wider interests than

the uninitiated might assume. Pallid angels, created by

Urgathoa from the souls of her most dedicated champions

and priestesses, represent these interests. Warriors and

tacticians, wielders of profane magic and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_ weaponry,

pallid angels are embodiments of the goddess’s appetite

for wanton bloodshed and forbidden pleasures.

The average _pallid angel_ stands 7 feet tall and weighs

200 pounds.
