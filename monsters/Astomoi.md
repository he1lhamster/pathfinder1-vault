  Mouthless (Ex): Astomoi don't need to eat or drink to survive. Instead, they absorb

    it had been eaten, rendering the food useless to others. Astomoi consume potions
    and other ingested materials in the same fashion. Since they never actually ingest
    anything, they can't normally be exposed to ingested poisons.
  Sensitive Breath (Ex): Astomoi take a -2 penalty on saving throws against disease
    and inhaled poisons.
  Telepathic Senses (Ex): Astomoi can't speak or see, but can mentally sense the area
    within 60 feet, as per darkvision, and can speak telepathically. An astomoi can't
    see anything beyond 60 feet. An astomoi must provide thought components for spells
    that normally require verbal components. It can use language-dependent abilities
    with its telepathy, but not abilities that depend on audible components.
desc_long: These mysterious humanoids require no food-indeed, they have no mouths-and
  they have no eyes with which to survey their environment. Instead, they rely on
  their powerful minds to sense the world around them, and subsist on nutrients absorbed
  from the air. This can turn against them, however, as powerful smells and inhaled
  poisons can render an astomoi helpless. Predisposed to asceticism, astomoi rarely
  wear more than rags, if they wear anything at all.

##### Description

These mysterious humanoids require no food—indeed, they have no mouths—and they have no eyes with which to survey their environment. Instead, they rely on their powerful minds to sense the world around them, and subsist on nutrients absorbed from the air. This can turn against them, however, as powerful smells and inhaled poisons can render an _astomoi_ _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_. Predisposed to asceticism, _astomoi_ rarely wear more than rags, if they wear anything at all.
