special_abilities:
  Immunity to Magic (Ex): A magnetite golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability
    that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
    differently against the creature, as noted below. Any spell that deals fire damage
    instead disables a magnetite golem's inescapable grip, magnetic disarm, and magnetic
    field for 1d4 rounds, with no saving throw.A magical attack that deals electricity
    damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise
    deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal
    hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A magnetite golem receives
    no saving throw against electricity effects.
  Inescapable Grip (Ex): Whenever a magnetite golem hits a metallic creature or a
    creature wearing metal armor with its slam attack, it attempts to grapple the
    creature as a free action that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. If a
    magnetite golem successfully grapples such a creature, it partially adheres to
    the golem's body, and the golem needs only one arm to maintain the grapple. In
    these instances, a magnetite golem may still make a single slam attack on its
    turn with its remaining arm.
  Magnetic Disarm (Su): Whenever a magnetite golem hits a creature wielding a metal
    weapon with its slam attack, it attempts to disarm the weapon as a free action
    that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If the golem successfully disarms
    a metal weapon, the weapon sticks to the golem's magnetic body rather than dropping
    to the ground. The golem is considered to have possession of the weapon, and the
    weapon must be retrieved using a disarm combat maneuver.
  Magnetic Field (Su): A magnetite golem is surrounded by a magnetic field, which
    pulls all metallic creatures and objects toward it. At the start of a magnetite
    golem's turn, as a free action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, the
    golem attempts a combat maneuver check against every creature within 30 feet that
    is connected to a piece of metal. Affected creatures include (but are not limited
    to) metallic creatures, creatures wearing metal armor, and creatures wielding
    metal weapons. If the golem succeeds at its combat maneuver against a creature,
    the affected creature is pulled 10 feet closer to the golem, and can't move away
    from the golem during its next round. The magnetic field is stronger than gravity,
    and can pull creatures off the ground. This movement doesn't provoke attacks of
    opportunity. Unattended Large or smaller metal objects automatically travel toward
    magnetite golem at a rate of 10 feet per round. This magnetism is supernatural
    in nature and affects all metal objects.
desc_long: |-
  Though softer than iron golems-upon whom their design is based-and problematic in most industrial settings, magnetite golems still prove to be useful, specialized constructs for both security and salvage. A magnetite golem's humanoid body is made of magnetite, a naturally magnetic mineral. A magnetite golem mindlessly obeys its creator's instructions, and, like most golems, shrugs off the most devastating magical assaults. To complicate matters, a magnetite golem emits a magnetic field, which forcefully pulls metallic objects closer-including creatures holding metal weapons or clad in metal armor. Once within range, metal-bearing opponents find it difficult to pull themselves away. Magnetite golems specialize in grappling and disarming creatures that rely on metal equipment.

  Magnetite golems are usually about 9 feet tall, and weigh approximately 1,500 pounds.

##### Description

Though softer than iron golems—upon whom their design is based—and problematic in most industrial settings, magnetite golems still prove to be useful, specialized constructs for both security and _[[spells/Salvage|salvage]]_. A magnetite golem’s humanoid body is made of magnetite, a naturally magnetic mineral. A magnetite golem mindlessly obeys its creator’s instructions, and, like most golems, shrugs off the most devastating magical assaults. To complicate matters, a magnetite golem emits a _magnetic field_, which forcefully pulls metallic objects closer—including creatures holding metal weapons or clad in metal armor. Once within range, metal-bearing opponents find it difficult to _pull_ themselves away. Magnetite golems specialize in grappling and disarming creatures that rely on metal equipment.

Magnetite golems are usually about 9 feet tall, and weigh approximately 1,500 pounds.
