special_abilities:
  Mixed Mind (Ex): A skeltercat's mind is a bizarre combination of animal instinct
    and human intellect. This disordered consciousness grants the creature immunity
    to confusion effects. Additionally, any creature that attempts to read a skeltercat's
    mind or communicate with it telepathically must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or
    be shaken for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Musk (Ex): A skeltercat has glands that produce a noxious musk. Any living creature
    within 10 feet must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4
    rounds and sickened for 1 minute afterward. A creature that successfully saves
    is instead sickened for 1d4 rounds and can't be affected again by the same skeltercat's
    musk for 24 hours. This is a poison effect, and other skeltercats are immune to
    this effect. A skeltercat can suppress this effect as a free action. The save
    DC is Constitution-based.
  Partial Transformation (Su): |-
    A skeltercat can alter portions of its body in order to give itself access to certain abilities. As a standard action three times per day, a skeltercat can gain one of the abilities listed below. A partial transformation lasts for 10 minutes. As a swift action, a skeltercat that has already activated a partial transformation can spend an additional use of this ability to switch which benefit it receives. Only one such benefit can be in effect at a time.

     Climb: The skeltercat's claws extend, granting it a climb speed equal to half its base land speed. Additionally, when falling within arm's reach of a wall, ledge, or something else it could grab on to for stability, it can slow its descent, taking damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter.

     Hide: The skeltercat's hide bristles like that of an angry cat and grows thicker, increasing its natural armor bonus by 2.

     Legs: The skeltercat grows an additional pair of legs, bringing its total to six, increasing its base land speed to 60 feet, and granting it the rake special ability. The rake attacks use the same damage and critical threat range as the skeltercat's normal claw attacks.

     Swim: The skeltercat grows webbing between its toes and whale-like flukes on its tail, granting it a swim speed equal to its base land speed. Additionally, it gains the hold breath universal monster ability.

     Tail: The skeltercat's tail grows thick and clublike. It gains a tail slap as a primary attack that deals 1d6 points of damage plus trip on a successful hit.
  Scream (Su): A skeltercat can release a terrifying cry that affects all creatures
    within a 300-foot spread. All creatures in that area must succeed at a DC 13 Will
    save or become panicked for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect.
    A creature that successfully saves against this effect can't be affected by the
    same skeltercat's scream for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  For a long time, many experts believed the creature now known as the skeltercat existed only in the folklore of the Shoanti tribes or in the far-fetched tales of a few wild-eyed travelers. Only with the recent reopening of the Bloodsworn Vale have rumors of the skeltercat's existence been taken seriously. As traffic through the vale increases, reports of attacks by strange, shapeshifting cats are growing startlingly commonplace. Such tales are told most frequently in the fortress city of Skelt, a common stopover for merchants traveling through the Bloodsworn Vale. The stories out of Skelt gave these creatures their name.

  The skeltercat resembles a heavily muscled cougar or mountain lion, having a tawny coat, powerful paws with retractable claws, and strong hind legs that allow it to jump great distances. It primarily walks about on all fours, adopting an oddly hunched posture that distinguishes it from normal cats. When faced with a threat, a skeltercat rises onto its hind legs, walking upright in a disturbingly human fashion. An adult skeltercat stands just shy of 8 feet tall when fully upright, and weighs up to 300 pounds.

##### Description

For a long time, many experts believed the creature now known as the _skeltercat_ existed only in the folklore of the Shoanti tribes or in the far-fetched tales of a few wild-eyed travelers. Only with the recent reopening of the Bloodsworn Vale have rumors of the _skeltercat_’s existence been taken seriously. As traffic through the vale increases, reports of attacks by strange, shapeshifting cats are _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Growing|growing]]_ startlingly commonplace. Such tales are told most frequently in the fortress city of Skelt, a common stopover for merchants traveling through the Bloodsworn Vale. The stories out of Skelt gave these creatures their name.

The _skeltercat_ resembles a heavily muscled cougar or mountain _lion_, having a tawny coat, powerful paws with retractable claws, and strong hind legs that allow it to _[[spells/Jump|jump]]_ great distances. It primarily walks about on all fours, adopting an oddly hunched posture that distinguishes it from normal cats. When faced with a threat, a _skeltercat_ rises onto its hind legs, walking upright in a disturbingly human fashion. An adult _skeltercat_ stands just shy of 8 feet tall when fully upright, and weighs up to 300 pounds.
