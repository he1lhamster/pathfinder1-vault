  Angled Entry (Su): Hounds of Tindalos move through the dimensions in ways other
    creatures cannot comprehend. They may use greater teleport (self only) once per
    round as a swift action and plane shift (self only) 3/day as a standard action
    (caster level 10th). A hound of Tindalos can use these powers anywhere, but its
    destination point must be adjacent to a fixed angle or corner in the physical
    environment, such as a wall, floor, or ceiling (as determined by the GM); temporary
    angles created by cloth, flesh, or small items are not sufficient. It cannot use
    these abilities to enter curved architecture or open outdoor environments.
  Otherworldly Mind (Ex): Any non-outsider attempting to read the thoughts of a hound
    of Tindalos or communicate with it telepathically takes 5d6 points of nonlethal
    damage and must make a DC 18 Will save or become confused for 2d4 rounds. This
    is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Ripping Gaze (Su): 5d6 slashing damage, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 18 negates. A creature
    that succeeds on its save is immune to that hound's gaze for 24 hours. Damage
    caused by a ripping gaze can be defeated by damage reduction, but it bypasses
    DR/magic and slashing. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: Hounds of Tindalos are otherworldly predators from beyond the bounds of
  known reality, usually appearing only when summoned by reckless spellcasters. Little
  is known about their nature outside of blood-spattered notes and deranged writings
  of the nearly insane survivors of their attacks. Although possessed of great cunning
  and cruel intellect, the hounds show no evidence of understanding or communicating
  with mortals. They enter the physical world on their own in pursuit of those who
  have trodden too much the netherways beyond time and reality-time travelers (be
  it physical travel or simply divinatory glimpses forward or backward in time) and
  creatures that teleport without regard to how this movement impacts subtle magical
  currents in the multiverse particularly draw their interest.

##### Description

Hounds of Tindalos are otherworldly predators from beyond the bounds of known reality, usually appearing only when summoned by reckless spellcasters. Little is known about their nature outside of blood-spattered notes and deranged writings of the nearly insane survivors of their attacks. Although possessed of great _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cunning|cunning]]_ and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_ intellect, the hounds show no evidence of understanding or communicating with mortals. They enter the physical world on their own in pursuit of those who have trodden too much the netherways beyond time and reality—time travelers (be it physical travel or simply divinatory glimpses forward or backward in time) and creatures that teleport without regard to how this movement impacts subtle magical currents in the multiverse particularly draw their interest.
