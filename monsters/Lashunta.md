  The lashunta are the primary race of Castrovel, called “the Green Planet” for its steaming jungles. Though the women look like idealized elves or humans-save for the twitching antennae sprouting from their foreheads-their men are squat, hairy, and broad-shouldered, with a fierce and confrontational demeanor. Both genders excel at scholarship, and the race boasts a large number of telepaths and telekinetics, in addition to conventional magic-users. This ability to create mental or empathic bonds is particularly prevalent among female warriors, who form close connections with their saurian mounts.

  Female lashunta are typically 6 feet tall and weigh 140 pounds. The males of the race are usually 5 feet tall and weigh 200 pounds.
