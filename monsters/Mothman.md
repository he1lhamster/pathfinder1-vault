    by the GM. Typical uses of this ability include casting major image to coax someone
    to a portentous location, casting raise dead to return someone with an important
    fate to life, or using rusting grasp to weaken a structure and cause some necessary
    calamity.
  Mind-Warping Gaze (Su): Fear, 30 feet, Will DC 18 negates. A creature that fails
    a save against this attack becomes shaken for 1d6 rounds. A creature currently
    suffering from a fear effect that fails this save instead takes 1d4 points of
    Wisdom damage. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

  Mothmen stand almost 7 feet tall and weigh 100 pounds.
