  Starlight Blast (Su): As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a lyrakien can
    tap into the divine power of Elysium, unleashing a blast of holy starlight in
    a 5-foot burst. All creatures in this area take 1d4 points of holy damage, plus
    1 point for each step their alignment deviates from chaotic good. For example,
    a chaotic neutral or neutral good creature would take 1d4+1 points of damage,
    a neutral creature would take 1d4+2 points of damage, and a lawful evil creature
    would take 1d4+4 points of damage. A DC 12 Reflex save negates this damage. Chaotic
    good creatures are unaffected by this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Traveler's Friend (Su): The performances and company of a lyrakien ease the burden
    of travel. Once per day, a creature may spend a minute listening to a lyrakien's
    performance-doing so removes the effects of exhaustion and fatigue from the listener.
desc_long: |-
  Lyrakien are divine musicians and messengers, mainly in the employ of deities of travel and natural wonders. They love to explore and visit beautiful places, especially locations with excellent views of rainbows, moonlight, and the stars. Whimsical and joyous, they love contests of song, dance, and knowledge, and keep journeys happy by distracting their companions from weary feet and stale food. Mortals who please them with excellent tales and new songs may be rewarded with elaborate maps, forgotten shortcuts, or rambling directions to hidden locations that hold lost magic. 

  Lyrakien are light-hearted creatures, but they are very protective of breathtaking natural locations. Often called “glistenwings” by gnomes and halflings, lyrakien are frequently mistaken for fey-while they are generally friendly with true fey, their origin is the plane of Elysium. Like other azatas, they grow restless if they stay in one place too long. A chaotic good 7th-level spellcaster can gain a lyrakien as a familiar if she has the Improved Familiar feat.

##### Description

Lyrakien are divine musicians and messengers, mainly in the employ of deities of travel and natural wonders. They love to explore and visit beautiful places, especially locations with excellent views of rainbows, moonlight, and the stars. Whimsical and joyous, they love contests of song, dance, and knowledge, and keep journeys happy by _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Distracting|distracting]]_ their companions from weary feet and stale food. Mortals who please them with excellent tales and new songs may be rewarded with elaborate maps, forgotten shortcuts, or rambling directions to hidden locations that hold lost magic.

Lyrakien are light-hearted creatures, but they are very protective of breathtaking natural locations. Often _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ “glistenwings” by gnomes and halflings, lyrakien are frequently mistaken for fey—while they are generally friendly with true fey, their origin is the plane of Elysium. Like other azatas, they grow restless if they stay in one place too long. A chaotic good 7th-level spellcaster can gain a lyrakien as a familiar if she has the _[[feats/Improved Familiar|Improved Familiar]]_ feat.
