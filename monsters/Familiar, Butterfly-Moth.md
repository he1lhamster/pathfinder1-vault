##### Description

Butterflies are delicate, brightly colored insects that feed on nectar and other sources of sugar. Moths have the same statistics as butterflies, though they tend to be active at night. The butterfly (or moth) presented here is a particularly large specimen with a wingspan of just over 6 inches, yet it is still completely harmless and awards no XP if slain.
