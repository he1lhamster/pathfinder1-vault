### Special Abilities

**Adaptive Defenses (Su)** After being damaged by any

magical effect that deals cold, electricity, fire, or

sonic damage, a _[[monsters/Riftcreeper|riftcreeper]]_’s body instantly adapts

to become immune to that form of energy. A

_riftcreeper_ can adapt to only one of those four types

of energy at a time—if it adapts to a new energy

type, it loses its _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to the previous type.

Otherwise, the _immunity_ lasts for 1 hour.

**Gelatinous Surge (Ex)** Once per minute as a standard

action, a _riftcreeper_ can extrude a protoplasmic

tendril of ooze to _attach_ to any vertical surface

within 120 feet. It can then transfer its entire

bulk along that tendril as part of that standard action

to change its location to the surface to which it is now

attached. This movement doesn’t provoke attacks of

opportunity. Any creatures along its line of travel are

subjected to a bull rush attempt.
**Strands (Ex)** A _riftcreeper_ can extend up to six thin, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sticky|sticky]]_

strands from its body at a time as a standard action,

launching them to a maximum range of 120 feet. These

attacks resolve as ranged touch attacks. On a hit, a strand

deals 2d6 points of acid damage to its target and attaches to

the creature. These strands are quite strong, but any amount

of slashing damage severs them (a strand has AC 25). As

long as a strand remains attached to a target, that creature

takes an additional 2d6 points of acid damage at the start of

its turn. A _riftcreeper_ can automatically absorb the strands

into its body if it uses its gelatinous surge ability (in doing

so, it releases any attached creatures).

##### Description

Heaving masses of unnatural protoplasm known as

riftcreepers prowl the Abyss’s shattered canyons. Despite

their name, these intelligent, _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Malevolent|malevolent]]_ oozes are quite

_[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Agile|agile]]_ and swift, _slithering_ up and down canyon walls and

swimming through even the foulest water. Although smart

enough to understand Abyssal, riftcreepers have little

interest in listening to the babbling of the sacks of meat

that will soon be their food.
