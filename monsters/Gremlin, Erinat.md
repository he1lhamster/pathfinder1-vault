special_abilities:
  Discordant Aura (Su): An erinat radiates an aura that imparts both gullibility and
    susceptibility to mental influence. Creatures within a 20-foot radius take a -2
    penalty on saves against compulsion effects, and Bluff checks attempted against
    such creatures gain a +5 bonus. This bonus also applies on opposed Charisma checks
    against a charmed creature within the aura.
  Lashing Chains (Ex): Erinats have 5-foot reach when attacking on their turn with
    their spiked chains, though they don't threaten adjacent squares when it is not
    their turn.
  Malicious Mischief (Su): A pair of erinats working together for 1 round can present
    an item and compel a creature to take it. This functions as beguiling giftAPG
    (DC 13), but rather than using the item in the appropriate fashion, the recipient
    is compelled to use the item to attack a random non-gremlin creature within 30
    feet, even if the recipient must use the item as an improvised weapon. Additionally,
    a group of six erinats working together over the course of 1 hour can create an
    effect identical to malicious spiteUM (DC 16) on any living creature. This effect
    functions at CL 6th, and the target creature must be either willing or helpless.
desc_long: Erinat gremlins are obsessed with conflict and discord. They love nothing
  more than starting fights-the more inane and pointless the struggle, the better.
  Erinat gremlins typically use alter self to take the appearance of unfed, unwashed
  humanoid children as appropriate to their surroundings, allowing the gremlins to
  move freely through settlements (and accuse anyone who attempts to stop their malicious
  conduct of trying to kidnap them). Erinats don't care who wins the fights they start;
  they simply wish to be entertained by the largest brawls they can arrange. The mischievous
  gremlins delight in creating chaos, and are prone to making outrageous claims in
  the hope of sparking riots, aided by forcing bystanders to attack each other with
  random, often ridiculous objects.

##### Description

Erinat gremlins are obsessed with conflict and discord. They love nothing more than starting fights—the more inane and pointless the struggle, the better. Erinat gremlins typically use _alter self_ to take the appearance of unfed, unwashed humanoid children as appropriate to their surroundings, allowing the gremlins to move freely through settlements (and accuse anyone who attempts to stop their malicious conduct of trying to kidnap them). Erinats don’t care who wins the fights they start; they simply _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ to be entertained by the largest brawls they can arrange. The mischievous gremlins delight in creating chaos, and are _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ to making outrageous claims in the hope of sparking riots, aided by forcing bystanders to attack each other with random, often ridiculous objects.
