special_abilities:
  Preserve Memory (Su): Any sentient creature with a Charisma of 14 or higher can
    copy one of its memories into a stone idol. To do so, the creature must remain
    in contact with a stone idol for 1 minute and concentrate on a memory to be duplicated.
    This memory must be 5 minutes or shorter and be of an actual event; imaginings
    cannot be reproduced. After a memory has been duplicated, it remains in the stone
    idol until a new memory is recorded. A memory held by a stone idol can be altered
    via the spell modify memory. A memory held within a stone idol can be viewed by
    any creature that comes into mental contact with the construct and by the use
    of detect thoughts, mind-reading effects, or similar abilities, even one redirected
    by its stony mind ability.
  Stony Mind (Su): Any divination spell targeting a creature or object within 30 feet
    of a stone idol instead targets the construct. Thus, for the purposes of any spell
    that reveals auras, those affected are treated as being under the effects of the
    spell misdirection, while spells like detect thoughts receive nothing more than
    vague impressions. Should detect thoughts or another mind-reading effect target
    a stone idol that contains a memory, the ability user instantly gains the memory
    held within.
  Suggestive (Su): Those fascinated by a stone idol's animal trance or hypnotic pattern
    spell-like ability become highly susceptible to the suggestions of others nearby.
    Any creature can make a suggestion (as per the spell suggestion) to a fascinated
    creature, who must then make a DC 15 Will save or proceed to follow the suggestion.
    Any creature who makes a suggestion is understood by the fascinated creature,
    as per the spell tongues or speak with animals. A suggestion lasts for 1 hour,
    even if a creature is no longer being fascinated. A fascinated creature follows
    only the first suggestion it fails its saving throw against and no additional
    suggestions. The DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
desc_long: Rarely seen in civilized lands, stone idols rest among the ruins of ancient
  civilizations, the sole inheritors of incredible secrets and lost lore. Sculpted
  in the images of forgotten lords and mythic beasts, these statuettes transfix their
  foes with a suggestion of what wonders their polished eyes might once have witnessed.

A _fascinated_ creature follows only the first _suggestion_ it fails its saving throw against and no additional suggestions. The DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

##### Description

Rarely seen in civilized lands, stone idols rest among the ruins of ancient civilizations, the sole inheritors of incredible secrets and lost lore. Sculpted in the images of forgotten lords and mythic beasts, these statuettes transfix their foes with a _suggestion_ of what wonders their polished eyes might once have witnessed.
