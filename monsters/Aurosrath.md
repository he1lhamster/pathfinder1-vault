    5 additional points of fire damage it took that round. Speed is reduced to 20

    their breath by 3 instead of 1 at the end of each round.
  Suffocating Wealth (Ex): A creature affected by an aurosrath's strangle ability
    cannot breathe. A strangled creature must hold its breath as it is suffocated
    by the flood of coins that spill from the undead's open mouth and onto the victim's
    face.
desc_long: |-
  Aurosraths arise from individuals who die tragic deaths caused by immense wealth, such as an explorer who would rather die beneath a collapsing tomb's roof than forfeit the hoard of gold he's just discovered. The avarice that motivated these people in life continues into undeath as negative energy fuses their souls with the riches they so desperately clung to, transforming them into horrific walking treasure troves that hunger for ever more gold even as it overflows from their bulging bodies.

   The average aurosrath stands 15 feet tall and weighs almost 1,100 pounds.
