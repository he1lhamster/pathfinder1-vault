# Mortic, Etioling
Glowing veins of green creep across the flesh of this pale,

spasming gnome. Stifled giggles escape her rictus grin.

### Special Abilities

**Corrupting Touch (Su)** An etioling can corrupt living flesh

with her touch as a standard action. This attack inflicts

a number of d6 equal to its CR in damage (10d6 for

most etiolings). This damage is not negative energy—it

manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from

supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging

are immune to this damage, as are undead and creatures

with the mortic subtype; otherwise, the damage bypasses

all forms of _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_. A successful DC 24 Fortitude

save halves the damage dealt. An etioling cannot turn this

ability off.

**Ectoplasmic Seep (Su)** An etioling’s body constantly weeps

ectoplasm—a physical manifestation of the bleachling _[[spells/Apathy|apathy]]_

her body can no longer contain. Any creature touching or

being touched by an etioling, or attacking her with a melee

weapon, must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex saving throw or be

coated in this fluid _apathy_, taking a –2 penalty on attack rolls,

caster level checks, saving throws, skill checks, and weapon

damage rolls until the ectoplasm can be scraped off as a

standard action. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Ectoplasmic _Shield_ (Su)** An etioling adds her Charisma

modifier as a _deflection_ bonus to her Armor Class.

**Ghostly Gasp (Su)** In addition to the normal abilities all

mortics gain when using their death gasp, an etioling

gains a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect) and can pass through

walls and other solid obstructions as if under the effects

of _[[spells/Ethereal Jaunt|ethereal jaunt]]_, except that the etioling cannot pass

through living creatures or plants. While moving through

a wall or other solid object in this way, the etioling treats

the structure as difficult terrain and must use additional

movement to pass through it.
**Spells (Ex)** An etioling casts spells as a 10th-level _[[classes/Bard|bard]]_ but

cannot cast spells while holding her breath.

##### Description

Perhaps the most _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Miserable|miserable]]_ of the mortics—humanoids

infused with necrotic energy—etiolings are born from

gnomes who have already begun to suffer from the

Bleaching. The burst of negative energy into their living

flesh twists the process and awakens connections to the

First World and long-lost fey magic, leaving the surviving

creature ethereal, manic, and overflowing with the vital

essence of fey. While they resemble bleachling gnomes,

veins of primal, First World energy pump beneath an

etioling’s pale flesh. Occasional pulses of unchecked

energy crackle across their flesh and hair.

Their _[[spells/Transformation|transformation]]_ is hardly one of _[[feats/Redemption|redemption]]_.

An etioling’s touch decays living flesh to fuel the

supernatural furnace that rages inside them, and their

bodies shake uncontrollably as the churn of primordial

magic and negative energy causes tremors and muscle

spasms. Focusing for more than a few moments becomes

impossible, and etiolings become creatures of instinct

and impulse, acting on vague memories and emotional

connections. Like ghosts, they stick for days or weeks into

a routine, reliving some pivotal memory and assigning

familiar identities to new people they meet. Etiolings

suspend not only their living functions but also their

physical connection to the living world, becoming

ethereal when they hold their breath.

An etioling stands between 2 and 3 feet tall and weighs

about 25 pounds.
