  Cold Healing (Ex): Calathgars are healed by cold. Anytime a calathgar is subjected
    to cold damage, it regains 1 hit point (regardless of the amount of cold damage
    dealt). When in areas of severe cold (such as arctic regions or near brown mold),
    a calathgar gains fast healing 1.
  Mold Mulch (Ex): Upon being reduced to 0 hit points, a calathgar withers and swiftly
    decays, transforming into a 5-foot patch of brown mold. If a calathgar is killed
    by fire, the mold immediately grows into a 10-foot patch. If it is killed in a
    space already occupied by brown mold, that mold patch doubles in size just as
    though fire had been brought near. The area within 30 feet of brown mold is cold
    enough to activate a calathgar's cold healing and the persistent effect of its
    seed spray. Brown mold deals 3d6 points of nonlethal cold damage to all creatures
    within 5 feet of it. See page 416 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for additional
    details.
  Seed Spray (Ex): Once every 1d4 rounds, up to 3 times per day, a calathgar can expel
    a blast of thorny, frozen seeds in a 15-foot cone. All creatures in this area
    take 4d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 15 for half ). In frigid climes-areas
    where the temperature is 40 degrees or colder-these seeds cling to those they
    strike, dealing an additional 1d6 points of cold damage on the following round.
    The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
  Known to grow in the depths of the densest frozen forests, realms where icicles rarely melt from the snow-cloaked trees, calathgars, or “hail lilies,” grow to a size and possess an alien beauty that make their cuttings greatly desired in civilized lands. Yet, what few beside the wariest hunters and most knowledgeable denizens of the forests realize is that hail lilies are more than mere flowers-their fully grown varieties possess not only a deadly way of spreading their frozen seeds but also an even more dangerous trait: thought. Known among their own kind as calathgars, these ice-tinged plants move slowly and possess little in the way of society, yet they perceive their surroundings, know when their frigid gardens are threatened, feel pain, and-most tenaciously- seek a chilling revenge when their young are despoiled.

  The blooms of a fully grown calathgar measures 3 feet in diameter, though some have reported flowers up to 5, 8, and even 10 feet wide. Able to crawl on three tendrillike roots, one of these plants might stand as high as 4 feet off the ground, and when heavy with seeds might weigh as much as 50 pounds.

##### Description

Known to grow in the depths of the densest frozen forests, realms where icicles rarely melt from the snow-cloaked trees, calathgars, or “hail lilies,” grow to a size and possess an alien beauty that make their cuttings greatly desired in civilized lands. Yet, what few beside the wariest hunters and most knowledgeable denizens of the forests realize is that hail lilies are more than mere flowers—their fully grown varieties possess not only a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ way of spreading their frozen seeds but also an even more dangerous trait: thought. Known among their own kind as calathgars, these ice-tinged plants move slowly and possess little in the way of society, yet they perceive their surroundings, know when their frigid gardens are threatened, feel pain, and—most tenaciously— seek a chilling revenge when their young are despoiled.

The blooms of a fully grown _calathgar_ measures 3 feet in diameter, though some have reported flowers up to 5, 8, and even 10 feet wide. Able to crawl on three tendrillike roots, one of these plants might stand as high as 4 feet off the ground, and when heavy with seeds might weigh as much as 50 pounds.
