special_abilities:
  Divine Separation (Su): The herald has been separated from Lissala for thousands
    of years and does not know where her master is. The loss of her connection to
    the goddess severely weakens the herald, and she gains 1 negative level per day,
    up to a maximum of 16 negative levels. These negative levels cannot be suppressed
    or removed in any way (including restoration spells), except by using her feed
    ability. If Lissala returns and the herald regains her connection to her master,
    she permanently loses this weakness and its associated negative levels.
  Feed (Su): Once per day, the herald can devour an outsider's corpse as a full-round
    action. For each Hit Die of the devoured outsider, the herald automatically removes
    1 negative level gained from her divine separation ability. The consumed outsider
    must have at least 8 Hit Dice.
  Intelligence Drain (Su): The herald drains 1d4 points of Intelligence each time
    she hits with her slam attack. (The herald does not heal any damage when she uses
    her Intelligence drain.)
  Power Surge (Su): Three times per day as a swift action, the herald can increase
    the DC of her next spell-like ability (if it is cast that round) by +2.
  Spell-Like Crafting (Su): The herald may use any of her spell-like abilities when
    crafting magic items as if they were actual spells.
desc_long: |-
  Lissala's herald is Kurshu the Undying, a powerful and dutiful agent of magic who has been suffering in her master's long absence. Known as “Kurshu the Divine Serpent” during the time of Thassilon, she possesses a powerful serpentine lower body, a female humanoid upper body, and three pairs of feathered wings. Her humanoid half is more serpentine than that of a lillend; she has tiny scales on her arms and a scaly cobra hood that blends into her hair. She looks haggard, as if afflicted with a chronic wasting disease, and her movements betray an ancient and resigned weariness. Her voice is thin and susurrant, and she tends to hiss when she speaks, especially when angry. She tends to verbalize in Thassilonian even when communicating telepathically. She is a lost being without a purpose, devoted to Lissala but unable to find her.

  Records of the herald's origin are lost to passing centuries, but she claims she was created in her current form by the goddess, who used parts from several different creatures and then granted her true life. The goddess's withdrawal has taxed the herald's ability to maintain her own life, and eventually she may fragment back into her component pieces (which may or may not be alive after this transformation). Bound to Lissala by magic and an unshakable sense of duty, she resents her master for leaving her behind to wither away, and despises herself for knowing that if Lissala returns, she will crawl back to the goddess like a sheltered, neglected child who has no alternative but to love her creator and jailor.

##### Description

Lissala’s herald is _[[monsters/Kurshu the Undying|Kurshu the Undying]]_, a powerful and dutiful agent of magic who has been suffering in her master’s long absence. Known as “Kurshu the Divine Serpent” during the time of Thassilon, she possesses a powerful serpentine lower body, a female humanoid upper body, and three pairs of feathered wings. Her humanoid half is more serpentine than that of a lillend; she has tiny scales on her arms and a scaly cobra hood that blends into her hair. She looks haggard, as if afflicted with a chronic wasting disease, and her movements betray an ancient and resigned weariness. Her voice is thin and susurrant, and she tends to hiss when she speaks, especially when angry. She tends to verbalize in Thassilonian even when communicating telepathically. She is a lost being without a purpose, devoted to Lissala but unable to find her.

Records of the herald’s origin are lost to passing centuries, but she claims she was created in her current form by the goddess, who used parts from several different creatures and then granted her true life. The goddess’s withdrawal has taxed the herald’s ability to maintain her own life, and eventually she may fragment back into her component pieces (which may or may not be alive after this _[[spells/Transformation|transformation]]_).
