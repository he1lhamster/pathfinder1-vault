special_abilities:
  Hungry Gaze (Su): Chemnosit's gaze attack deals 3d6 points of nonlethal damage plus
    fatigue at a distance of 120 feet. A successful DC 30 Fortitude save negates the
    fatigue. Creatures already fatigued become exhausted; creatures already exhausted
    become staggered. A creature that fails its save must succeed at a DC 30 Will
    save or gain an overwhelming compulsion to eat flesh of creatures of its type,
    including its own if no other is available. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
  Spines (Ex): Creatures striking Chemnosit with natural weapons, unarmed strikes,
    melee weapons, or melee touch attacks take 2d6+12 points of damage.
desc_long: The dread burrower Chemnosit is an engine of destruction, able to devour
  the stoutest construction and the mightiest of mortals with ease. His power lies
  in the profane glamour of his glowing eye, inspiring a gruesome urge to devour-a
  hunger for the flesh of one's own kind. For all his power, this is the true dread
  of the Monarch Worm. While he burrows constantly through the Darklands to the deepest
  Vaults of Orv, he sometimes rises to Golarion's surface bringing annihilation in
  his wake, as those corrupted by his awful eye wreak devastation upon themselves
  and their own people. Chemnosit drinks in the carnage like a feast before devouring
  any survivors.

The dread burrower Chemnosit is an engine of _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_, able to devour the stoutest construction and the mightiest of mortals with ease. His power lies in the profane glamour of his glowing eye, inspiring a gruesome urge to devour—a hunger for the flesh of one’s own kind. For all his power, this is the true dread of the Monarch Worm. While he burrows constantly through the Darklands to the deepest Vaults of Orv, he sometimes rises to Golarion’s surface bringing annihilation in his wake, as those corrupted by his awful eye wreak devastation upon themselves and their own people. Chemnosit drinks in the carnage like a feast before devouring any survivors.
