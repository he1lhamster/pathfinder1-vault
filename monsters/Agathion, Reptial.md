special_abilities:
  Imposing Presence (Ex): As a standard action, a reptial can expand the frills on
    its robes and body dramatically, making it appear larger until the beginning of
    its next turn. All creatures within 30 feet who witness this transformation must
    succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be shaken for 1d6 rounds. A creature who succeeds
    on this saving throw is immune to this reptial's imposing presence for 24 hours.
    This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Relic Collector (Ex): Reptials are fond of collecting items with even tangential
    connections to significant celestial events. A reptial has a mental focus pool
    which it can choose to store in a relic. The pool contains a number of points
    equal to 5 + the reptial's Intelligence modifier (9 points for a typical reptial).
    Each day, it can choose one school of magic that is tied to one of its relics.
    It gains the resonant power for that school of magic as if it were a 5th-level
    occultist storing all its points of mental focus in that relic. A reptial can
    only store focus in one relic at a time. As a free action, a reptial can expend
    1 point of mental focus from the relic to add 1d6 to the result of a skill or
    ability check. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results
    are revealed. A reptial can only use 1 point of mental focus per check. A reptial
    can use this ability to add a bonus on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft
    skill check without expending a point of mental focus.
desc_long: Reptials are curious and benevolent scholars of Nirvana. They spend their
  time collecting holy relics, no matter how minor, and can store some of their knowledge
  within a chosen relic. They keep most of these relics for themselves, but individual
  reptials have been known to distribute particularly useful pieces to good-aligned
  individuals and temples that are enduring difficult trials. Such relics often appear
  mysteriously within a temple or home, placed carefully among other objects. Reptials
  prefer to avoid combat if possible, using their abilities to escape instead and
  find heroes or more warlike agathions to combat evil directly. A reptial stands
  3 feet tall and weighs about 40 pounds, not counting the weight of its many relics.

They spend their time collecting holy relics, no matter how minor, and can store some of their knowledge within a chosen relic. They keep most of these relics for themselves, but individual reptials have been known to distribute particularly useful pieces to good-aligned individuals and temples that are enduring difficult trials. Such relics often appear mysteriously within a temple or home, placed carefully among other objects. Reptials prefer to avoid combat if possible, using their abilities to escape instead and find heroes or more warlike agathions to combat evil directly.
