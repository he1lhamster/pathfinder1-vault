  Bay (Su): When the Sandpoint Devil screams as a standard action, all creatures within
    a 300-foot-radius spread must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or become panicked

    save is successful, creatures within the effect are immune to the Sandpoint Devil's
    bay for 24 hours thereafter. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Hellfire Breath (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds, the Sandpoint Devil can unleash a blast
    of infernal flame from its mouth as a standard action. This hellfire fills a 30-foot
    cone and causes 10d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 20 half). Anyone who takes
    damage from this breath weapon must also make a DC 20 Will save to avoid becoming
    cursed by the infernal flames-those who become cursed take a -4 penalty on all
    attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for a number of days equal to the
    damage taken-during this time, the victim's skin appears to be horribly burned
    in places regardless of any healing applied. This curse effect functions at caster
    level 12th. The save DC for both saves is Constitution-based.
  Kick (Ex): The Sandpoint Devil's hoof attacks are primary attacks that deal bludgeoning
    and slashing damage.
desc_long: |-
  The legendary Sandpoint Devil has haunted the lands around its namesake town on the western Varisian coast for well over a decade. It most commonly appears on misty, moonless nights, sometimes leaving behind strange clues to its passing, such as brimstone-smelling hoofprints in odd places (such as along the eaves of a steep roof ).

  A thief of livestock, kidnapper of children, and bringer of woes-countless tales surround the beast. Some explain away the creature as an ancient, wizard-warped beast from a forgotten age. Others hold that the monster was borne by a cursed witch who broke an oath with a devil. Yet perhaps the most disturbing rumors point to the possibility that the creature is but one of many that dwell in the wilds.
