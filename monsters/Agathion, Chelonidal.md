special_abilities:
  Bulwark (Ex): Chelonidals drill to defend important sites, and they inspire others
    to do the same. The chelonidal and allies adjacent to it gain a morale bonus equal
    to the chelonidal's Constitution bonus on saving throws against effects that would
    cause them to move from their current square, as well as to their CMD against
    such effects. When an adjacent ally would be reduced to 0 hit points or fewer,
    the chelonidal can use its lay on hands ability to help that ally as an immediate
    action; the chelonidal is then staggered for 1 round.
  Celestial Soldier (Sp): A chelonidal's natural weapons, as well as any manufactured
    weapons it wields, are under the constant effects of greater magic fang or greater
    magic weapon (as appropriate). The caster level of these effects is equal to the
    chelonidal's Hit Dice, including Hit Dice gained from class levels or other effects.
  Lay on Hands (Su): A chelonidal can use lay on hands as per a 9th-level paladin.
    This ability cures fatigue and exhaustion in addition to damage, as though the
    chelonidal had the appropriate mercies.
  None Shall Pass (Ex): When making attacks of opportunity provoked by movement, a
    chelonidal adds its Charisma bonus to the attack roll. On a hit, the target immediately
    stops moving in its current square and can't move until the start of its next
    turn.
  Protective Shell (Su): A chelonidal's fortified shell protects it from many threats.
    A chelonidal can't be flanked, and attacks that would benefit from flanking deal
    only half their normal damage to the chelonidal. In addition, the chelonidal's
    touch AC is modified by its natural armor bonus. As a standard action, a chelonidal
    can create total cover along one edge of its space, as though using a tower shield;
    this total cover applies to others as well as the chelonidal.
  Underwater Mobility (Ex): While completely submerged in water, a chelonidal gains
    the benefits of Dodge, Mobility, and Spring Attack.
desc_long: |-
  Chelonidal agathions are the foot soldiers and guards of Nirvana. While the realm's inhabitants prize enlightenment over militarism, the agathions recognize that vigilant guardians are necessary to the preservation of peace. Chelonidals form from the souls of those who willingly gave their lives in defense of a person or place, or who protected the sea from terrestrial threats.

   Like all agathions, chelonidals are capable of speaking with any linguistically gifted creature. Their voices generally have a gravelly quality that reminds most listeners of a grizzled veteran soldier. This idea is reinforced by the chelonidals' habitual good-natured cantankerousness, as well as their fondness for war stories.

   Chelonidals and dwarves often get along well, despite the latter race's dislike for the sea; the agathions share dwarves' resolve, as well as their traditional military tactics. Trudd, dwarven deity of strength and defense, has arrangements with several legions of chelonidals, and he occasionally sends them in response to planar ally spells.

   A typical chelonidal is 6 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.

##### Description

Chelonidal agathions are the foot soldiers and guards of Nirvana. While the realm’s inhabitants prize enlightenment over militarism, the agathions recognize that _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Vigilant|vigilant]]_ guardians are necessary to the preservation of peace. Chelonidals form from the souls of those who willingly gave their lives in defense of a person or place, or who protected the sea from terrestrial threats.

Like all agathions, chelonidals are capable of speaking with any linguistically gifted creature. Their voices generally have a gravelly quality that reminds most listeners of a grizzled veteran soldier. This idea is reinforced by the chelonidals’ habitual good-natured cantankerousness, as well as their fondness for war stories.

Chelonidals and dwarves often get along well, despite the latter race’s dislike for the sea; the agathions share dwarves’ resolve, as well as their traditional military tactics. Trudd, dwarven deity of strength and defense, has arrangements with several legions of chelonidals, and he occasionally sends them in response to _[[spells/Planar Ally|planar ally]]_ spells.

A typical chelonidal is 6 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.
