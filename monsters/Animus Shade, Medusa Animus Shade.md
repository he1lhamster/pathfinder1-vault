  Every intelligent mind exists as a war of aspects-primitive survival urges and base wants opposing intellectual reason and high-minded goals. Some of these aspects dominate the mind, defining a creature's personality, while others are shackled away. Sometimes, psychic injuries can loosen these shackles, revealing aspects of a creature they normally control and hide away. When a creature dies from a psychic injury, its conscious mind may shear away, leaving only those subconscious aspects-their animus-behind. Called animus shades, these spectral undead are gripped with feral rage and lash out at the living. Individuals who engage in psychic combat are particularly prone to succumbing to this form of undeath, and their shades sometimes seek out their former opponents, not content until their one-time adversaries are slain.

  Animus shades always bear a superficial resemblance to their former, living selves, but manifest in death as wild brutes, made powerful by their anger and feral by their long suffering. Animus shades' forms appear hunched and contorted after a lifetime of being crushed beneath the weight of the dominant psyches. They sport wicked claws, overlong limbs, cracked flesh, and other nightmarish deformities reflecting the fears their living selves harbored about the dark corners of their own minds. Any gear or items they possessed appear rotted, cracked, and torn in spectral form, though they may carry ghostly versions of the weapons they used in life, deadly implements still capable of harming the living.

  Most often, animus shades linger near the sites of their deaths or wander without any specific purpose. As many psychic contests occur in mindscapes or on far-flung esoteric planes, animus shades are frequently found roaming such realms, endlessly raging over the sometimes centuries-old defeats that resulted in their demises. Even when not consumed by such losses, animus shades commonly target those they happen across who remind them of the dominant selves that repressed them in life-whether because of similarities in physical appearance, personality, or activity. However, some rare animus shades possess greater clarity of focus and are gripped with the need to undo the accomplishments of their living selves, taking pleasure in destroying everything that they once loved or took pride in.

  As animus shades result from psychic violence, they most commonly appear among intelligent races and beings known for mastering occult forces. Even among such races, these undead prove far more common within cultures and groups that cultivate psychic prowess-they're well known to the people of Vudra, for instance, and have long been documented by Iroran priests. However, for the majority of the Inner Sea region's people, they're easy to mistake for ghosts or other undead-often to tragic ends. Fortunately, in lands that value strength over mental prowess, or in strictly martial cultures, animus shades are almost unknown. Members of races such as hobgoblins, kobolds, and orcs, which rarely give rise to psychically talented individuals, almost never rise as animus shades.

  Because of the psychic violence that spawned them, animus shades rarely, if ever, cooperate. In death, even animus shades created from former allies slain by the same foe viciously strike out at each other. The mental trauma that fills them and holds them to the world scars these undead deeply, but ultimately makes them most resentful of themselves-as they know their own weakness or distraction resulted in their deaths. Much of their rage is thus pointed inward, and they take particular satisfaction in viciously unleashing their hatred on those who resemble themselves, especially if such conflicts remind them of the battles in which they died.

##### Description

Every intelligent mind exists as a war of aspects—primitive survival urges and base wants opposing intellectual reason and high-minded goals. Some of these aspects dominate the mind, defining a creature’s personality, while others are shackled away. Sometimes, _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ injuries can loosen these shackles, revealing aspects of a creature they normally control and hide away. When a creature dies from a _psychic_ injury, its conscious mind may shear away, leaving only those subconscious aspects—their animus—behind. _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|Called]]_ animus _[[spells/Shades|shades]]_, these spectral undead are gripped with feral _rage_ and lash out at the living. Individuals who engage in _psychic_ combat are particularly _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ to succumbing to this form of undeath, and their _shades_ sometimes seek out their former opponents, not content until their one-time adversaries are slain.

Animus _shades_ always bear a superficial resemblance to their former, living selves, but manifest in death as wild brutes, made powerful by their anger and feral by their long suffering. Animus _shades_’ forms appear hunched and contorted after a lifetime of being crushed beneath the weight of the dominant psyches. They sport wicked claws, overlong limbs, cracked flesh, and other nightmarish deformities _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Reflecting|reflecting]]_ the fears their living selves harbored about the dark corners of their own minds. Any gear or items they possessed appear rotted, cracked, and torn in spectral form, though they may carry ghostly versions of the weapons they used in life, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ implements still capable of harming the living.

Most often, animus _shades_ linger near the sites of their deaths or wander without any specific purpose. As many _psychic_ contests occur in mindscapes or on far-flung esoteric planes, animus _shades_ are frequently found roaming such realms, endlessly raging over the sometimes centuries-old defeats that resulted in their demises. Even when not consumed by such losses, animus _shades_ commonly target those they happen across who remind them of the dominant selves that repressed them in life—whether because of similarities in physical appearance, personality, or activity. However, some rare animus _shades_ possess greater _[[items/Weapon/Clarity|clarity]]_ of focus and are gripped with the need to undo the accomplishments of their living selves, taking pleasure in destroying everything that they once loved or took pride in.

As animus _shades_ result from _psychic_ violence, they most commonly appear among intelligent races and beings known for _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Mastering|mastering]]_ occult forces. Even among such races, these undead prove far more common within cultures and groups that cultivate _psychic_ prowess—they’re well known to the people of Vudra, for instance, and have long been documented by Iroran priests. However, for the majority of the Inner Sea region’s people, they’re easy to mistake for ghosts or other undead—often to tragic ends. Fortunately, in lands that value strength over mental prowess, or in strictly martial cultures, animus _shades_ are almost _[[monsters/Unknown|unknown]]_. Members of races such as hobgoblins, kobolds, and orcs, which rarely give rise to psychically talented individuals, almost never rise as animus _shades_.

Because of the _psychic_ violence that spawned them, animus _shades_ rarely, if ever, cooperate. In death, even animus _shades_ created from former allies slain by the same foe viciously strike out at each other. The mental trauma that fills them and holds them to the world scars these undead deeply, but ultimately makes them most resentful of themselves—as _[[spells/They Know|they know]]_ their own weakness or _[[universal monster rules/Distraction|distraction]]_ resulted in their deaths. Much of their _rage_ is thus pointed inward, and they take particular satisfaction in viciously unleashing their hatred on those who resemble themselves, especially if such conflicts remind them of the battles in which they died.
