    A megapiranha swarm can notice creatures by scent in a 180-foot radius underwater and can detect blood in the water at ranges of up to a mile.

    Shoals of piranhas are voracious feeders, capable of stripping the flesh from the bones of large animals with astonishing speed. These fish have garnered a well-earned reputation in regions where they thrive, but while they are native to tropical rivers, many species of piranha are incredibly hearty. Collectors of exotic pets sometimes ship tanks of these carnivorous fish home, and some unscrupulous owners even put the fish to work disposing of unwanted bodies. When the authorities draw near, panicked criminals sometimes dump the fish into nearby rivers, inadvertently unleashing schools in waters woefully unprepared for their ravenous introduction!
