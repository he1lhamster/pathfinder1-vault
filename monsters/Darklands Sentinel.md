special_abilities:
  Flare (Su): As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a Darklands sentinel can
    release a flare of dazzling light. This burst of light illuminates a 30-foot radius
    area for a split second. Any creature within this area must make a DC 11 Fortitude
    save or be dazzled for 1d6 rounds. Sightless creatures, as well as creatures already
    dazzled, are not affected by the light burst. Darklands sentinels are immune to
    the flares of their own kind. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  No Breath (Ex): While a Darklands sentinel does actually breathe, it uses little
    oxygen and is capable of storing an adequate supply in its body to last it for
    months at a time. As a result, a Darklands sentinel is immune to the effects of
    harmful vapors (such as cloudkill spells) and cannot suffocate or drown.
  Shocking Arc (Su): |-
    As a standard action, a Darklands sentinel can launch an arc of electricity up to 30 feet long as a ranged touch attack. Any creature struck by this attack takes 1d6 points of electricity damage. A Darklands sentinel receives a +3 circumstance bonus on attack roll against targets wearing metal armor, made out of metal, or carrying a large amount of metal.

    While underwater, a Darklands sentinel's shocking arc acts instead as a burst of electricity. All creatures within 5 feet of the creature must make a DC 11 Reflex save or take 1d6 points of electricity damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: In the depths of the Darklands, where light is an alien intrusion if not
  actually inimical, exist strange creatures of the world's voidlike spaces that have
  adapted and thrived in such surroundings. One such creature is the Darklands sentinel,
  used for generations by sentient races as alarm systems and defenders, much like
  the more mundane and less hardy shrieker species of fungus. A Darklands sentinel
  resembles nothing so much as an ordinary stalactite with a strange crystalline mineral
  content. It has a rocky exterior that completely covers its body except at its base,
  which is fleshy and covered with hundreds of cilia that allow it limited locomotion
  and the ability to cling tenaciously to almost any surface- even while upside down.
  Beneath the stony exterior is a soft, flesh-colored, sluglike creature, though extracting
  one from its stony shell without killing it is virtually impossible.

### Special Abilities

**_Flare_ (Su)** As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a _[[monsters/Darklands Sentinel|Darklands sentinel]]_ can release a _flare_ of dazzling light. This burst of light illuminates a 30-foot radius area for a _[[universal monster rules/Split|split]]_ second. Any creature within this area must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or be _[[conditions/Dazzled|dazzled]]_ for 1d6 rounds. Sightless creatures, as well as creatures already _dazzled_, are not affected by the light burst. Darklands sentinels are immune to the flares of their own kind. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**_No Breath_ (Ex)** While a _Darklands sentinel_ does actually breathe, it uses little oxygen and is capable of storing an adequate supply in its body to last it for months at a time. As a result, a _Darklands sentinel_ is immune to the effects of harmful vapors (such as _[[spells/Cloudkill|cloudkill]]_ spells) and cannot suffocate or drown.
**Shocking Arc (Su)** As a standard action, a _Darklands sentinel_ can launch an arc of electricity up to 30 feet long as a ranged touch attack. Any creature struck by this attack takes 1d6 points of electricity damage. A _Darklands sentinel_ receives a +3 circumstance bonus on attack roll against targets wearing metal armor, made out of metal, or carrying a large amount of metal.

While _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Underwater|underwater]]_, a _Darklands sentinel_’s shocking arc acts instead as a burst of electricity. All creatures within 5 feet of the creature must make a DC 11 Reflex save or take 1d6 points of electricity damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

In the depths of the Darklands, where light is an alien intrusion if not actually inimical, exist strange creatures of the world’s voidlike spaces that have adapted and thrived in such surroundings. One such creature is the _Darklands sentinel_, used for generations by sentient races as _[[spells/Alarm|alarm]]_ systems and defenders, much like the more mundane and less hardy shrieker species of fungus. A _Darklands sentinel_ resembles nothing so much as an ordinary stalactite with a strange crystalline mineral content. It has a rocky exterior that completely covers its body except at its base, which is fleshy and covered with hundreds of cilia that allow it limited locomotion and the ability to cling tenaciously to almost any surface— even while upside down. Beneath the stony exterior is a soft, flesh-colored, sluglike creature, though extracting one from its stony shell without killing it is virtually impossible.
