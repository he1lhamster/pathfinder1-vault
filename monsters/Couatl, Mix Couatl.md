  Gift of Knowledge (Ex): 'When a mix couatl uses its modify memory ability, it can
    implant a memory of up to 1 hour in length. In addition to its normal modifications,
    it can use modify memory to grant the knowledge of a particular skill to a creature.
    When using the ability in this way, the mix couatl chooses one of the following
    skills: Craft (any), Handle Animal, Heal, Knowledge (engineering), Knowledge (geography),
    Knowledge (nature), Profession (any), Ride, Spellcraft, Survival, or Use Magic
    Device. The target of the spell automatically gains a number of ranks in that
    skill equal to its Hit Dice (maximum 5 ranks) and treats that skill as a class
    skill. The target creature retains the skill ranks for up to 1 month, after which
    the creature loses the skill ranks but still treats the chosen skill as a class
    skill. A creature can receive the gift of skills in this way only once; it can
    never receive this gift again, even from a different mix couatl.'
  Poison (Ex): Injury-bite; save Fortitude DC 19; frequency 1/ minute for 10 minutes;
    effect 1d3 Wis damage; cure 1 save. The DC is Constitution-based.
  Spells: A mix couatl casts spells as a 7th-level druid. Druid spells are considered
    arcane spells for a mix couatl, meaning that it doesn't need a divine focus to
    cast them.
  Star Child (Ex): A mix couatl gains power from the night sky, granting it a +20
    bonus on Stealth checks to hide against the darkness of the sky. In addition,
    its fly speed increases to 80 feet (perfect) at night.
desc_long: Mix (pronounced “meesh”) couatls are a variety of couatl known for their
  ability to grant guidance and knowledge to fledgling societies. They seek out less
  established tribes and villages and offer their knowledge to help such settlements
  flourish. A mix couatl can offer a variety of knowledge depending on the nature
  of the settlement and its people. To some, they offer knowledge of new farming and
  hunting techniques, while others are taught more esoteric knowledge, like the arcane
  arts. While nurturing a settlement, a mix couatl typically acts as its protector,
  keeping at bay any foes that would disrupt the growth of the people. A typical mix
  couatl is 12 feet long with a wingspan of 15 feet and weighs 1,500 pounds.
