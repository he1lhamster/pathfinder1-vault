# Saxra
An immense humanoid skeleton stands draped in tattered robes,

its horselike skull lit from within by an eerie red glow.

### Special Abilities

**Bone Swarm (Su)** Any creature that

ends its turn within 5 feet of a _saxra_ takes 5d6 points of

slashing damage and 5d6 points of negative energy damage

from the whirling cloud of bone shards that surrounds it.

Before the bone swarm deals damage, it attempts a caster

level check to dispel any _[[spells/Death Ward|death ward]]_ effects on the target

(as per a CL 20 _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ spell).
**Spawn Skeleton (Su)** Any creature that dies within 60 feet

of a _saxra_ must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or rise as a

skeleton (or skeletal _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Champion|champion]]_ if it has an Intelligence score

of 3 or more) in 1d4 rounds. Creatures raised as skeletons

are overcome with the desire to _[[spells/Slay Living|slay living]]_ creatures, but the

_saxra_ has no control over them. The save DC is Charisma-based.
**Splintered Ground (Su)** As a standard action, a _saxra_ can cause

splintered bones to erupt from all terrain (except worked

stone or open water) in a 100-foot radius. Any creature

moving across this area takes 2d6 points of piercing damage

and 2d6 points of negative energy damage for every 5 feet

of movement, and must succeed at a DC 30 Reflex save

or have its land speed reduced by half for 10 minutes.

The bones remain and continue to deal damage

indefinitely unless someone removes them

manually (taking 10 minutes of work for each

5-foot square) or the _saxra_ uses this ability

again. The save DC is Charisma-based.

##### Description

This undead spirit of bones and wind

makes its home high atop remote

mountains. Legends claim that a

_saxra_ can call forth amazing

insights from latent memories

stored in the very bones that make

up its form.

A _saxra_ towers over 20 feet tall

and weighs 2 tons.
