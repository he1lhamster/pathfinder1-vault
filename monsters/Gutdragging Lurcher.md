is_3.5: true
desc_short: A sound like soaked ropes slapping wetly against the floor heralds this
  thing's disgusting approach. A corpse slides along the floor, its gut ripped open,
  a mass of wriggling greasy entrails spilling forth like serpents. The viscera possess
  an unholy life of their own, pulsating obscenely as they wetly grip doorframes,
  tables, and anything else to pull the body about, like giant worms dragging their
  plump meal behind them. The bloated horror ceases its approach. The sloppy intestines
  seem to sense fresh prey, hovering momentarily before shooting forward with frightening
  speed.

  Choking Viscera (Ex): A grappled foe experiences unimaginable horror. The rotting,
    putrid intestines that wriggle about the gutdragging lurcher push themselves into
    the enemy's mouth (pulping themselves through closed teeth even) and pour down
    the victim's throat to choke her to death. Anyone grappled by the lurcher must
    make a DC 14 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. If reduced
    to below 0 hp, the victim begins to suffocate until the lurcher releases her or
    she perishes, choking on foulness. The save DC is Strength-based.
  Corpse Puppets (Su): A lurcher's entrails may slither down the throat of any fresh
    corpse it finds (dead no longer than 2 days), animating the body as a zombie under
    the lurcher's control. One lurcher cannot control more than its Hit Dice worth
    of zombies at any one time.
  Entrails (Ex): A lurcher's entrails may attack foes up to 20 feet away. In addition,
    these tentacles “see” just as well as the lurcher and can spot foes around corners.
    They can also squeeze into small openings or under doors to attack enemies. A
    lurcher feeds on the viscera of the dead to increase its Hit Dice and reach. For
    every 3 HD the lurcher has above 5, increase the reach of its entrails by another
    10 feet. Old and powerful lurchers often sit within nests of warrens, their disgusting
    entrails infesting the places and animating corpse puppets to deal with anyone
    foolish enough to intrude.
  Improved Grab (Ex): If a gutdragging lurcher strikes an opponent with its entrails
    it may immediately initiate a grapple without provoking an attack of opportunity.
    If it succeeds in grappling the foe it immediately invades her mouth and throat
    with its choking viscera.
  Nauseating Appearance (Ex): Anyone who sees a gutdragging lurcher, or even its wriggling
    entrails, must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1 round.
    Success on this save renders the foe immune to this lurcher's appearance for 24
    hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  The first gutdragging lurcher was no doubt an abomination dreamed up by a sick necromancer who delighted in foulness and rot. Since the creation of this disgusting undead, its taint has spread and now gluttonous humanoids with evil-polluted souls often rise as gutdragging lurchers upon death. A corpulent corpse polluted with evil stirs after death, and its entrails burst free from their fat guts to seek out fresh prey. Lurchers are particularly vile undead who feed on the entrails of the living, often choking their victims to death with their flapping wet tendrils of rotting intestine and then pulling the foe's guts out through their mouths to add to its wriggling collection of viscera.

  Gutdragging lurchers are intelligent foes and some command a sizeable force of corpse puppets. Rumor has it a minor crime lord in Absalom's Flotsam District, who rules a large subsystem of the sewers there, is actually a lurcher named Vleer.

# Gutdragging Lurcher
A sound like soaked ropes slapping wetly against the floor heralds this thing’s disgusting approach. A corpse slides along the floor, its gut ripped open, a mass of wriggling greasy entrails spilling forth like serpents.

The bloated horror ceases its approach. The sloppy intestines seem to sense fresh prey, hovering momentarily before shooting forward with frightening speed.

##### Description

The first _gutdragging lurcher_ was no doubt an abomination dreamed up by a sick necromancer who delighted in foulness and rot. Since the creation of this disgusting undead, its taint has spread and now gluttonous humanoids with evil-polluted souls often rise as gutdragging lurchers upon death. A corpulent corpse polluted with evil stirs after death, and its entrails burst free from their fat guts to seek out fresh prey. Lurchers are particularly vile undead who feed on the entrails of the living, often choking their victims to death with their flapping wet tendrils of rotting intestine and then pulling the foe’s guts out through their mouths to add to its wriggling collection of viscera.

Gutdragging lurchers are intelligent foes and some _[[spells/Command|command]]_ a sizeable force of corpse puppets. Rumor has it a minor _[[npcs/Crime Lord|crime lord]]_ in Absalom’s Flotsam District, who rules a large subsystem of the sewers there, is actually a lurcher named Vleer.
