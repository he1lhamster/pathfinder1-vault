    the save DC by only 1 instead of 2.
  Thorn Cluster (Ex): A thorny can shoot a cluster of thorns from its back as a ranged
    attack against any target within 30 feet. If the attack hits, the target is struck
    by 1d3 poisoned thorns, each dealing 1d3 points of piercing damage. Each thorn
    applies a single dose of the thorny's poison. A successful critical hit on this
    attack instead means the target has been struck by four poisoned thorns. A thorny
    can use this ability every 1d3 rounds.
  Thorny Hide (Ex): When a thorny is eligible to use its thorn cluster attack, its
    hide fills with numerous thorns. Creatures grappling or making natural attacks
    against the thorny immediately take 1d3 points of piercing damage and are each
    affected by 1 dose of the thorny's poison.
desc_long: Known by many as “vegepygmy hounds,” these masses of fungal matter dwarf
  their diminutive vegepygmy kin, but still maintain a strong sense of loyalty to
  them. Named for the vicious thorns that adorn their backs, thornies infect their
  prey with a weak paralytic toxin, making the prey susceptible to capture. Creatures
  infected by russet mold while thorny poison lingers in their systems have a small
  chance of producing thorny offspring.

##### Description

Known by many as “_vegepygmy_ hounds,” these masses of fungal matter dwarf their diminutive _vegepygmy_ kin, but still maintain a strong sense of loyalty to them. Named for the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_ thorns that adorn their backs, thornies infect their prey with a weak paralytic toxin, making the prey susceptible to capture. Creatures infected by russet mold while thorny poison lingers in their systems have a small chance of producing thorny offspring.
