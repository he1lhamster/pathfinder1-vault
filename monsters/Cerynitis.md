  Freedom (Sp): Whenever a cerynitis is affected by a spell or effect that would be

  Sacred Grace (Ex): A cerynitis is blessed by her patron deity, allowing her to always
    act on the surprise round and granting her a sacred bonus to AC and initiative
    equal to her Charisma bonus.
  Uncanny Dodge (Ex): This ability functions as the rogue class feature of the same
    name.
  Unearthly Speed (Ex): When a creature makes a ranged or melee attack against a cerynitis,
    targets her with an ability, or includes her in the area of effect of an ability,
    the cerynitis can move up to half her speed as if she had readied an action to
    move. If she moves at all, this foils ranged and melee attacks; if she moves out
    of the area of effect, she avoids an area of effect ability; if she moves out
    of range of the targeted effect, she avoids a targeted ability. Once she uses
    this ability, a cerynitis can't use it again for 1 round. Each use of this ability
    counts as a move action for the purpose of triggering Lightning Stance. A cerynitis
    can't use unearthly speed to avoid an attack or ability if she is not aware of
    the attack or ability, and she cannot use this ability at all if she is rendered
    immobile or if she bears a rider.
desc_long: |-
  Cerynitises are rare golden does with magnificent metallic horns and hooves. These solitary creatures are born to ordinary deer with the blessings of a deity, typically a deity of nature or the hunt. Cerynitises are wise and placid creatures, but humanoids hunt them nonetheless for their valuable horns and pelts (worth 1,000 gp together), or for the sheer challenge of catching the uncatchable. Though heroes of nature occasionally dream of having a cerynitis mount, none have yet succeeded at gaining the service of such a prized steed. Though she is likely to run away before a conversation can begin, a cerynitis is willing to share her wisdom with those who prove they do not mean her harm.

  A typical cerynitis measures 10 feet long from head to tail and weighs 350 pounds.

Cerynitises are rare golden does with magnificent metallic horns and hooves. These solitary creatures are born to ordinary deer with the blessings of a deity, typically a deity of nature or the hunt. Cerynitises are wise and placid creatures, but humanoids hunt them nonetheless for their valuable horns and pelts (worth 1,000 gp together), or for the sheer challenge of catching the uncatchable. Though heroes of nature occasionally _[[spells/Dream|dream]]_ of having a _cerynitis_ _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_, none have yet succeeded at gaining the service of such a prized steed. Though she is likely to run away before a conversation can begin, a _cerynitis_ is willing to share her wisdom with those who prove they do not mean her _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_.

A typical _cerynitis_ measures 10 feet long from head to tail and weighs 350 pounds.
