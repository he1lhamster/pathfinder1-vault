  Blood Siphon (Ex): A vampiric mist drains blood with each melee touch attack dealing
    1d3 points of Constitution damage. Every time a vampiric mist damages a creature
    in this way, it heals 1d8 hit points. Hit points healed in excess of its maximum
    are gained as temporary hit points, to a maximum amount equal to its Constitution
    score. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour.
  Blood Overdose (Su): When a vampiric mist gorges on blood to an extent that it gains
    temporary hit points, it moves much more quickly. It gains a +2 bonus to its Armor
    Class and on Reflex saves, and can take one additional move action each round.
  Misty Form (Ex): A vampiric mist's body is composed of a semisolid red mist similar
    in consistency to thick foam. The vampiric mist does not have a Strength score,
    and it cannot manipulate or wear solid objects. This form grants it the amorphous
    defensive ability, and allows it to move through areas as small as 1 inch in diameter
    with no reduction to its speed. The creature can speak in a hissing voice. A vampiric
    mist cannot enter water or other fluids, and is treated as a creature two size
    categories smaller than its actual size (Tiny for most vampiric mists) for the
    purposes of how wind affects it.
  Sense Blood (Ex): A vampiric mist can immediately sense the presence of warm-blooded
    creatures in a 60-foot radius as if by scent. It can detect exposed blood within
    a mile.
desc_long: |-
  Often mistaken for a vampire in gaseous form or an unusual type of air elemental, the vampiric mist is in fact a strange form of aberrant life. With an amorphous body that consists as much of fluid as it does of air, this creature dwells in swamps or moist underground regions where its vulnerability to heat isn't as much of a concern.

  Although somewhat intelligent, vampiric mists do not form societies. They sometimes form into small gangs, but even then they show little interest in working together. Much of a vampiric mist's time is spent seeking prey-a pursuit that the monster often shows great creativity in accomplishing. The creatures' propensity for taking on vague, skeletal forms of the creatures whose blood they drink only further adds to their mystique and fuels rumors that they have connections to the undead. Indeed, many vampiric mists enjoy using this common misconception to their advantage, causing foes to use foolish tactics-such as tricking spellcasters into using positive energy against them as if they were undead monsters.

##### Description

Often mistaken for a _[[monsters/Vampire|vampire]]_ in _[[spells/Gaseous Form|gaseous form]]_ or an unusual type of air elemental, the _vampiric mist_ is in fact a strange form of aberrant life. With an _amorphous_ body that consists as much of fluid as it does of air, this creature dwells in swamps or moist underground regions where its _[[curses/Vulnerability|vulnerability]]_ to _[[universal monster rules/Heat|heat]]_ isn’t as much of a concern.

Although somewhat intelligent, _vampiric_ mists do not form societies. They sometimes form into small gangs, but even then they show little interest in working together. Much of a _vampiric mist_’s time is spent seeking prey—a pursuit that the monster often shows great creativity in accomplishing. The creatures’ propensity for taking on vague, skeletal forms of the creatures whose blood they drink only further adds to their mystique and fuels rumors that they have connections to the undead. Indeed, many _vampiric_ mists enjoy using this common misconception to their advantage, causing foes to use foolish tactics—such as tricking spellcasters into using positive energy against them as if they were undead monsters.
