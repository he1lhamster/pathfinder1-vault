    a clockwork servant can repair damage done to either itself or an adjacent clockwork
    creature, healing 1d10 points of damage to the target.

Clockwork servants excel at repairing themselves and other clockworks on the battlefield, proving useful for skirmishes and campaigns alike.

  Rumors of clockwork servants with magically imparted intelligence persist among explorers of certain strange ruins-while no smarter than the average human, such “awakened” clockwork servants have skills and feats as appropriate for their Hit Dice (Disable Device +7, Perception +2, and Skill Focus [Disable Device] for most intelligent clockwork servants), and are said to serve in more complex roles than mere repair workers. An intelligent clockwork has an Intelligence score of 11 and can speak one language.

  Clockwork servants are about 5 feet tall and weigh over 400 pounds.

##### Description

Since clockwork engineers can’t always be present to make sure their devices are working at full capacity, the clockwork servant was invented to serve that role. Clockwork servants excel at repairing themselves and other clockworks on the battlefield, proving useful for skirmishes and campaigns alike.

Rumors of clockwork servants with magically imparted intelligence persist among explorers of certain strange ruins—while no smarter than the average human, such “awakened” clockwork servants have skills and feats as appropriate for their Hit Dice (Disable Device +7, Perception +2, and _[[feats/Skill Focus|Skill Focus]]_ [Disable Device] for most intelligent clockwork servants), and are said to serve in more complex roles than mere repair workers. An intelligent clockwork has an Intelligence score of 11 and can speak one language.
