  Adhesive Spray (Su): |-
    A night monarch can emit a spray of sticky, adhesive film once every 1d4 rounds. This creates a 30-foot cone of web-like strands that affect the area as per the spell web. Creatures in the area must make a DC 26 Reflex save to avoid becoming entangled. The strands last for 10 minutes before dissolving. The save is Constitution-based.

    A night monarch can use this spray in the air. If a flying creature that relies on wings or similar appendages to fly fails its Reflex save it is prevented from flying and falls.
  Blindsense (Ex): A night monarch notices and locates creatures within 60 feet. Opponents
    still have total concealment against a night monarch unless it can actually see
    them.
  Dream Dust (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds as a full-round action, the night monarch
    can flutter its wings and force the dust that clings to them to form a 30-foot-radius
    burst centered on the night monarch. This dust affects all creatures in the area
    as per the spell deep slumber but with no Hit Die limit. A DC 26 Will save negates
    this effect. Using dream dust is a standard action a night monarch can use at
    will. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  No Breath (Ex): The night monarch does not breathe. This quality extends to any
    creatures that it touches or who ride on its back.
  Poison Flesh (Ex): The flesh of a night monarch tastes sweet but contains a strong
    poison (ingested, Fortitude DC 26, initial 1 Con, secondary 1d8 Con). Any creature
    that succeeds on a bite attack against a night monarch ingests some of this poison.
    A creature that actively eats the flesh of a dead night monarch takes a -4 penalty
    on this saving throw. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Touch Telepathy (Su): A night monarch can communicate via telepathy with any creature
    it touches.
desc_long: The night monarch serves the goddess Desna as her herald on Golarion. Although
  the par ticulars of its appearance differ every time it is sighted, its common form
  is that of a titanic moth or butterfly with a brightly colored, 40-foot wingspan
  that often reflects some aspect of the quest the goddess has willed it upon. In
  times of great need, the night monarch rises to protect Desna's faithful and combat
  the most egregious depredations of the Mother of Monsters, Lamashtu. Sighting the
  night monarch is thought to bring good luck and favorable dreams, which many hold
  to be visions from the goddess herself.
