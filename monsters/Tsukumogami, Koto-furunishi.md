##### Description

A koto-furunishi is a tsukumogami that forms from

a koto, also known as a long zither. _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Benevolent|Benevolent]]_ but shy,

koto-furunishi enjoy playing beautiful music for others,

especially attentive and caring owners, but never when

they are being observed. Their penchant for doing so often

leads to _[[spells/Confusion|confusion]]_ as to the identity of the mysterious

musician. If mistreated, a koto-furunishi never retaliates

against its owner, but instead leaves its home to join a

band of other tsukumogami who will appreciate its music

more than its former owner.
