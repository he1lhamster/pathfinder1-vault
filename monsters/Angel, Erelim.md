special_abilities:
  Celestial Charge (Su): A mounted erelim is a force to be reckoned with. An erelim
    receives a +4 bonus on melee attack rolls on a charge while mounted (instead of
    the normal +2), and does not take any penalty to AC after making a charge attack
    while mounted. In addition, if an erelim confirms a critical hit on a mounted
    charge, the nearby area is washed in holy light. Each evil-aligned enemy in a
    20-foot-radius burst takes 2d8 points of damage and is blinded for 1 round. A
    successful DC 15 Will saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the
    blinded effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Inspiring Presence (Ex): When an erelim is mounted, all good-aligned allies within
    60 feet that can see the erelim receive a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and
    weapon damage rolls against evil-aligned creatures.
  Righteous Challenge (Ex): Three times per day, an erelim can challenge evil foes.
    As a swift action, the erelim chooses one target within sight to challenge. The
    erelim's melee attacks deal 2d4 additional points of damage to the target (or
    2d6 points of damage to evil outsiders). The erelim takes a -2 penalty to AC,
    except against attacks made by the target of the challenge. An erelim's challenge
    and additional damage only apply to evil-aligned creatures; if an erelim attempts
    to challenge a creature that is not evil, that use of challenge is expended for
    the day with no effect. The challenge remains in effect until the target is dead
    or unconscious or until the combat ends.
  Shining Mount (Su): As a standard action, an erelim can conjure forth a quasi-real
    mount made of pure light. This functions as per phantom steed (CL 8th), conjuring
    a mount with an Armor Class of 18, 15 hit points, a speed of 100 feet, and the
    ability to run or charge over sandy, muddy, or marshy terrain without penalty.
    The mount glows with a brightness equivalent to a daylight spell. Only the erelim
    who conjured it can ride the mount, and the erelim must be astride the mount to
    use celestial charge and inspiring presence. An erelim can dismiss the mount as
    a free action.
desc_long: |-
  Erelims serve as cavalry in celestial armies, charging into battle atop steeds of pure light and inspiring allies with valiant words and deeds. These angelic knights laugh in the face of overwhelming odds and love nothing more than to face destruction without fear, even going so far as to scorn armor. Honorable and respectful, erelims obediently follow the commands of celestial generals, but sometimes their fervor for righteous battle makes them frustratingly difficult to organize or call to retreat.

  Erelims appear as a variety of humanoid races from the Material Plane, though usually with dark, close-cropped hair. An erelim's wings are smaller and more elegant than those of other angels. A typical erelim stands 6 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds.

A successful DC 15 Will saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the _blinded_ effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Inspiring Presence (Ex)** When an erelim is mounted, all good-aligned allies within 60 feet that can see the erelim receive a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against evil-aligned creatures.

##### Description

Erelims serve as cavalry in celestial armies, charging into battle atop steeds of pure light and inspiring allies with _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Valiant|valiant]]_ words and deeds. These angelic knights laugh in the face of overwhelming odds and love nothing more than to face _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ without _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_, even going so far as to scorn armor. Honorable and respectful, erelims obediently follow the commands of celestial generals, but sometimes their fervor for _righteous_ battle makes them frustratingly difficult to organize or call to retreat.

Erelims appear as a variety of humanoid races from the Material Plane, though usually with dark, close-cropped hair. An erelim’s wings are smaller and more elegant than those of other angels. A typical erelim stands 6 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds.
