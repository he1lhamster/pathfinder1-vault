  Impaling Horn (Ex): An elasmotherium's immense horn can fully impale a creature
    that is two or more size categories smaller than the elasmotherium (a Medium or
    smaller creature for the typical elasmotherium). This ability effectively adds
    the grab universal monster ability to the elasmotherium's gore attack against
    such a creature, but if the elasmotherium successfully “grabs” a foe in this manner
    by impaling it on the horn, the elasmotherium does not gain the grappled condition.
    An elasmotherium's options while grappling a foe in this way are limited-it can
    either move while grappling the foe, or it can whip its head and attempt to fling
    the foe as if using the Awesome Blow feat (the damage dealt by this is equal to
    its gore damage). An elasmotherium can impale only one creature at a time with
    its horn, but can continue to attack normally with its gore.
desc_long: |-
  The elasmotherium is an enormous rhinoceros with an equally enormous temper-while it is an herbivore, the elasmotherium is incredibly aggressive and often attacks without provocation. 

  An elasmotherium is 20 feet long and weighs 8,500 pounds.
