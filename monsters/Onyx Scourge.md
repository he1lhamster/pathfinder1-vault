  Channel Negative Energy (Su): As a standard action, an onyx scourge can channel
    negative energy in a 30-foot burst as a 16th-level evil cleric. This ability requires
    no divine focus. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Entropic Strikes (Ex): An onyx scourge's slam attack deals an additional 3d6 points
    of negative energy damage. When used against an object, its slam attack ignores
    the first 5 points of hardness.
  Negative Energy Capacitance (Su): An onyx scourge's body stores negative energy,
    making it immune to death effects, energy drain, and negative energy. Additionally,
    if an onyx scourge is targeted by a negative energy attack, the next time it channels
    negative energy within 1 minute, it deals 50% more damage, as though this were
    an empowered spell.
desc_long: |-
  Onyx scourges are vicious brutes from the Plane of Earth that revel in their deadly power. They resemble elder earth elementals with striations of red and black onyx. Negative energy pulses and flows through the streaks of onyx like blood through exposed veins. The hollows and depressions that serve as an onyx scourge's eyes and mouth are deep voids warped into expressions of rage and hatred.

   Negative energy flows through each strike an onyx scourge makes, disrupting living and unliving matter alike. Onyx scourges can also unleash this energy in a devastating blast, which they enjoy using to inflict damage on multiple opponents at once. They gleefully wade into battle whenever given the opportunity.

   An onyx scourge is 40 feet tall and weighs 70,000 pounds.
