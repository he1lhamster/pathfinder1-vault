  Air Blast (Sp): A chuspiki can make a ranged attack with an intense air blast, as
    the kineticist wild talent of the same name, using its Hit Dice as its kineticist
    level.
  Basic Aerokinesis (Sp): A chuspiki can use basic aerokinesis, as the kineticist
    wild talent of the same name.
  Wind Blessed (Su): A chuspiki is treated as a Large creature for the purposes of
    determining the effects wind has upon it.
  Wind Form (Su): Three times per day as an immediate action, a chuspiki can become
    insubstantial for 1 round. It gains DR 10/magic and becomes immune to poison,
    sneak attacks, and critical hits. It can't attack or use any of its spell-like
    abilities while in wind form, with the exception of basic aerokinesis.
desc_long: |-
  Chuspikis are intelligent, mouselike creatures covered in a coat of downy tan fur which makes them appear much larger than they actually are. A chuspiki's tail is substantially longer than the rest of its body, fanning out into a sail-like structure. The base of its tail is strong and flexible, allowing the chuspiki to whip around the fan at the tip with surprising speed. It can use this motion to create concussive blasts of air, or to scratch opponents with barbs on the underside of its tail bones.

  Like the wind itself, chuspikis are always moving. Chuspikis soar through the air, riding their fans like gliders and summoning minor gusts to steer their flight. They rest in short bursts, napping for just an hour at a time.

  Whenever they can, chuspikis seek out new experiences. They are social creatures that prefer to travel with others of their kind, or with members of other species. Chuspikis feel an especially strong connection with other creatures who share their bond with the skies, such as air elementals and sylphs. Chuspikis enjoy exploring unique locations, and when they find a particularly fascinating site, they announce their find on the winds to encourage others to share in their discovery. A mysterious disembodied voice promising glorious adventure may very well be a chuspiki; however, the playful creatures are just as likely to play pranks on hapless passersby as they are to provide legitimate guidance.

  A typical chuspiki is 1 foot long, with its tail extending out an additional 5 feet, and weighs 1 pound. Its bones are hollow, like a bird's.

  A chuspiki will sometimes ally with a spellcaster as a familiar. A chaotic spellcaster can gain a chuspiki as a familiar at 7th level by taking the Improved Familiar feat.

##### Description

Chuspikis are intelligent, mouselike creatures covered in a coat of downy tan fur which makes them appear much larger than they actually are. A _chuspiki_’s tail is substantially longer than the rest of its body, fanning out into a sail-like structure. The base of its tail is strong and flexible, allowing the _chuspiki_ to _[[items/Weapon/Whip|whip]]_ around the fan at the tip with surprising speed. It can use this motion to create concussive blasts of air, or to scratch opponents with barbs on the underside of its tail bones.

Like the wind itself, chuspikis are always moving. Chuspikis soar through the air, riding their fans like gliders and summoning minor gusts to steer their _[[universal monster rules/Flight|flight]]_. They rest in short bursts, napping for just an hour at a time.

Whenever they can, chuspikis seek out new experiences. They are social creatures that prefer to travel with others of their kind, or with members of other species. Chuspikis feel an especially strong connection with other creatures who share their bond with the skies, such as air elementals and sylphs. Chuspikis enjoy exploring unique locations, and when they find a particularly fascinating site, they announce their find on the winds to encourage others to share in their discovery. A mysterious disembodied voice promising _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Glorious|glorious]]_ adventure may very well be a _chuspiki_; however, the playful creatures are just as likely to play pranks on hapless passersby as they are to provide legitimate _[[spells/Guidance|guidance]]_.

A typical _chuspiki_ is 1 foot long, with its tail extending out an additional 5 feet, and weighs 1 pound. Its bones are hollow, like a bird’s.

A _chuspiki_ will sometimes ally with a spellcaster as a familiar. A chaotic spellcaster can gain a _chuspiki_ as a familiar at 7th level by taking the _[[feats/Improved Familiar|Improved Familiar]]_ feat.
