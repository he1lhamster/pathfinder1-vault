  from their encounters pale and ill, speaking of a bizarre plantlike creature with
  burning red eyes, and twisted limbs that shoot jets of flame. A stench like acrid,
  burning dung follows the monster. Some who encounter the creature stumble out of
  the woods addlepated, raving of a hovering creature and its fire and poisonous mist.

The sleepy town of Melfesh has endured threats ranging from a gang of displaced troglodytes causing havoc to the strained political ramifications of having a drawbridge controlling trade through southeastern Varisia, but none trouble the place like the _Melfesh Monster_. Miners working the foothills of the Fenwall Mountains and farmers in the countryside surrounding Melfesh speak in hushed tones of a strange and _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Malevolent|malevolent]]_ monster that haunts the area.

A _[[universal monster rules/Stench|stench]]_ like acrid, _burning_ dung follows the monster. Some who encounter the creature stumble out of the woods addlepated, raving of a hovering creature and its fire and poisonous mist.
