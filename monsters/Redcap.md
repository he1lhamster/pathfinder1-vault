special_abilities:
  Boot Stomp (Ex): A redcap wears heavy iron boots with spiked soles that it uses
    to deadly effect in combat. These boots give the redcap a kick attack that it
    can make as a secondary attack, either as part of a full-attack action or as part
    of its movement just as if it had the Spring Attack feat.
  Heavy Weapons (Ex): A redcap can wield weapons sized for Medium creatures without
    penalty.
  Irreligious (Ex): Bitter and blasphemous, redcaps cannot stand the symbols of good-aligned
    religions. If a foe spends a standard action presenting such a holy symbol, any
    redcap that can see the creature must make a DC 15 Will save or become frightened
    for 1 minute and attempt to flee. A redcap who successfully saves is shaken for
    1 minute.
  Red Cap (Su): A redcap wears a tiny, shapeless woolen hat, dyed over and over with
    the blood of its victims. While wearing this cap, a redcap gains a +4 bonus on
    damage rolls (included in the above totals) and fast healing 3. These benefits
    are lost if the cap is removed or destroyed. Caps are not transferable, even between
    redcaps. A redcap can create a new cap to replace a lost cap with 10 minutes of
    work, although until the redcap takes a standard action to dip the cap in the
    blood of a foe the redcap helped to kill, the cap does not grant its bonuses.
desc_long: Redcaps embody both capriciousness and sadism. These stumpy, misanthropic
  fey freaks exist seemingly to indulge in blissful bloodletting and self-indulgent
  slaughter. Like prune-faced, angry old men, they mollycoddle their own inefficiencies
  and miseries in gore. Redcaps are most widely recognized for their long woolen caps,
  which they drench in the blood of their victims. Rumors and fairy stories abound
  concerning rituals and the cultural significance of their blood-soaked caps, though
  the practice likely evolved as an easy way for the brutish runts to create both
  fear and spectacle. Redcaps typically stand only 3 feet tall, with twisted frames,
  pointed ears, and long white beards. They dress in soiled leather armor and wear
  oversized, iron-shod boots that make a distinctive clanging when they run.

##### Description

Redcaps embody both capriciousness and sadism. These stumpy, misanthropic fey freaks exist seemingly to indulge in blissful _[[feats/Bloodletting|bloodletting]]_ and self-indulgent slaughter. Like prune-faced, angry old men, they mollycoddle their own inefficiencies and miseries in gore. Redcaps are most widely recognized for their long woolen caps, which they _[[spells/Drench|drench]]_ in the blood of their victims. Rumors and fairy stories abound concerning rituals and the cultural significance of their blood-soaked caps, though the practice likely evolved as an easy way for the brutish runts to create both _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ and spectacle. Redcaps typically stand only 3 feet tall, with twisted frames, pointed ears, and long white beards. They dress in soiled _leather armor_ and wear oversized, iron-shod boots that make a distinctive clanging when they run.
