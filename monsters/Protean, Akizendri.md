    damage and causes creatures within 20 feet of the target to become confused (Will
    DC 14 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Text Immersion (Su): As a standard action, an akizendri can physically immerse itself
    in a book, scroll, or similar object. It gains a +20 bonus on its Disguise check
    to disguise itself as a book and gains full control over the actual text the object
    displays. It cannot make physical attacks, but it can use its spell-like abilities
    and cast any spells recorded in a scroll it has immersed itself within, or cast
    spells up to 5th level if it's immersed in a spellbook. The akizendri can still
    be targeted by attacks and effects while immersed, but any damage is dealt to
    the object. The akizendri is forced out if the object is destroyed or affected
    by antimagic field, break enchantment, dispel magic, or mage's disjunction.
desc_long: Akizendris are the bane of scholars, capable of altering text, transposing
  sections between disparate tomes, and erasing book chapters only to vomit them up
  elsewhere.
