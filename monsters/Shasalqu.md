  While some reptiles bask in the sun's warm embrace toraise their body temperatures, a shasalqu is ravenous inits search of warmth. Even in equatorial deserts, it neverseems to have enough heat. Instead of just relying on thesun, a shasalqu gathers energy by sapping the heat fromthe air around it. It then uses the intense cold generatedfrom this heat absorption to trap its prey. A shasalqu is3 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs about 40 pounds.

  Most desert scholars believe the strange biology thatfuels a shasalqu's heat absorption is the same as that ofbrown mold, and some even claim that the creatures carrybrown mold spores in their bodies. This could account forshasalqus' ability to sap heat from their surroundings evenafter they die. Because of their sandy environs and the dropsof water that melt off their icy ridges, shasalqus' bodies areoften caked in a layer of gritty mud. Motionless shasalqusare often mistaken for rocks or small muddy clumps from adistance-a mistake desert travelers quickly come to regret.

  Shasalqus who settle near oases make their lairs farenough away to escape immediate notice, allowing them tosneak up on drinking or bathing creatures and then retreatto their lairs with little risk. Shasalqus that find a traderoute within their territory also digs lairs far enough awayto prey on travelers without betraying their presence.

  Regardless of their locations, shasalqu lairs areoften extremely damp since the desert's heat melts theaccumulated ice that crusts on the creatures' hides. Thismakes shasalqu lairs breeding grounds for a variety ofmosses and plants, especially those that can withstandcolder temperatures. These tiny oases rapidly become toomossy and cool for shasalqus, forcing them to leave insearch of new dens. Shasalqus frequently keep multipledens within their territory and rotate between them.

### Special Abilities

**Frigid Flesh (Ex)** A creature that hits a _[[monsters/Shasalqu|shasalqu]]_ with a natural

attack or an unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of cold damage.

**_Heat_ Absorption (Ex)** Shasalqus are immune to fire damage.

Instead, the _shasalqu_ gains 1 temporary hit point for

every 3 points of fire damage it would have taken, which

disappear after 1 hour.

**Trapping Cold (Su)** A _shasalqu_ exudes a heat-sapping aura.

Any creature that begins its turn within 10 feet of a _shasalqu_

takes 1d6 points of cold damage and becomes _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_. A

successful save negates both effects. An affected creature

is _entangled_ for as long as remains within the aura’s area

plus 1 additional round. Creatures whose cold _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ or

_[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ prevents all cold damage are not _entangled_. When

a _shasalqu_ dies, this aura persists around its corpse for 1

hour. The save DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

While some reptiles bask in the sun’s warm embrace to

raise their body temperatures, a _shasalqu_ is _[[curses/Ravenous|ravenous]]_ in

its search of warmth. Even in equatorial deserts, it never

seems to have enough _heat_. Instead of just relying on the

sun, a _shasalqu_ gathers energy by _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sapping|sapping]]_ the _heat_ from

the air around it. It then uses the intense cold generated

from this _heat_ absorption to trap its prey. A _shasalqu_ is

3 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs about 40 pounds.

Most desert scholars believe the strange biology that

fuels a _shasalqu_’s _heat_ absorption is the same as that of

brown mold, and some even claim that the creatures carry

brown mold spores in their bodies. This could account for

shasalqus’ ability to _[[items/Weapon/Sap|sap]]_ _heat_ from their surroundings even

after they die. Because of their sandy environs and the drops

of water that melt off their icy ridges, shasalqus’ bodies are

often caked in a layer of gritty mud. Motionless shasalqus

are often mistaken for rocks or small muddy clumps from a

distance—a mistake desert travelers quickly come to regret.

Shasalqus who settle near oases make their lairs far

enough away to escape immediate notice, allowing them to

sneak up on drinking or bathing creatures and then retreat

to their lairs with little risk. Shasalqus that find a trade

route within their territory also digs lairs far enough away

to prey on travelers without betraying their presence.

Regardless of their locations, _shasalqu_ lairs are

often extremely damp since the desert’s _heat_ melts the

accumulated ice that crusts on the creatures’ hides. This

makes _shasalqu_ lairs breeding grounds for a variety of

mosses and plants, especially those that can withstand

colder temperatures. These tiny oases rapidly become too

mossy and cool for shasalqus, forcing them to leave in

search of new dens. Shasalqus frequently keep multiple

dens within their territory and rotate between them.
