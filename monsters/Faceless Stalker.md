  Change Shape (Su): A faceless stalker can assume the form of a Medium humanoid at
    will but requires 10 uninterrupted minutes to alter its body. Performing this
    transformation is somewhat painful, but the faceless stalker can maintain its
    new form indefinitely once it has achieved it. It can change back to its true
    form as a swift action and gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls,
    skill checks, and saving throws for 1 round after it does so. Faceless stalkers
    retain their own innate abilities when they assume their new form and do not gain
    any of those belonging to the creature they mimic. A faceless stalker gains a
    +10 bonus on Disguise checks when they are used in conjunction with this ability.
  Faceless (Su): In its natural form, a faceless stalker has no discernible facial
    features. It gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made to resist attacks or effects
    that target the senses. This includes gaze attacks, odor-based attacks, sonic
    attacks and similar attacks. This bonus does not apply to illusions.
desc_long: |-
  Ugothols (as faceless stalkers call themselves) are one of the many tools created and then discarded by the aboleths in their long war against the surface dwellers. Scorned by their former masters when the scheme for which they were designed unraveled, the faceless stalkers fled into swamps, marshes, or any other dark, wet places they could find-the closest they could come to the aquatic cities they once considered home.

  Originally designed to serve as spies that could walk uncontested among the air-breathing races, faceless stalkers adopt new forms by reshaping their skin and contorting their rubbery bodies. This painful process takes approximately 10 uninterrupted minutes-an ugothol typically seeks a private place to do it, avoiding even others of its own kind. The sensation of returning to its true form is quite exhilarating and results in a momentary burst of euphoria.

  Faceless stalkers cannot digest solid food even when in the form of a creature with a mouth. Instead, they subsist on liquids, including blood. In their natural forms, they have three hollow tongues which they use to penetrate and lap blood from their victims. Since they have no particular skill at grappling foes, most ugothols wait until a victim is helpless or asleep before attempting to drink its blood-although the best is when a victim is helpless but conscious during the process, so that the faceless stalker can “play with its food” by having grisly and cruel conversations with it.

##### Description

Ugothols (as faceless stalkers call themselves) are one of the many tools created and then discarded by the aboleths in their long war against the surface dwellers. Scorned by their former masters when the scheme for which they were designed unraveled, the faceless stalkers fled into swamps, marshes, or any other dark, wet places they could find—the closest they could come to the aquatic cities they once considered home.

Originally designed to serve as spies that could walk uncontested among the air-breathing races, faceless stalkers adopt new forms by reshaping their skin and contorting their rubbery bodies. This painful process takes approximately 10 uninterrupted minutes—an ugothol typically seeks a private place to do it, avoiding even others of its own kind. The sensation of returning to its _true form_ is quite exhilarating and results in a momentary burst of euphoria.

Faceless stalkers cannot digest solid food even when in the form of a creature with a mouth. Instead, they subsist on liquids, including blood. In their natural forms, they have three hollow _tongues_ which they use to penetrate and lap blood from their victims. Since they have no particular skill at grappling foes, most ugothols wait until a victim is _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ or asleep before attempting to drink its blood—although the best is when a victim is _helpless_ but conscious during the process, so that the _faceless stalker_ can “play with its food” by having grisly and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_ conversations with it.
