  Steal Fire (Su): As a standard action, a kijimuna can call out to a nonmagical fire
    within 30 feet equivalent in size to the flames of a burning torch. Doing so causes
    the flame to become a light similar to that created by a dancing lights spell,
    under the control of the kijimuna. An attended object can make a DC 13 Reflex
    saving throw to avoid this effect. Unlike a dancing lights spell, a kijimuna's
    steal fire ability can cause a stolen fire to strike a creature, either ringing
    the target in light as per the spell faerie fire for 5 minutes, or dealing 2d6
    points of fire damage (DC 13 Reflex, half ). Both save DCs are Charisma-based.
    A lantern, candle, torch, or similar item that has its flame stolen cannot be
    relit by any means for 24 hours.
desc_long: |-
  The childlike kijimunas bear physical similarities to their Inner Sea cousins, the goblins, sharing their small size, leathery skin, and large, pointed ears. However, kijimunas' hair stands out as their most prominent features-long, wild manes of blazing red. These tricky creatures nearly always wear devilish grins, causing some who first see them to mistake them for trouble-making urchins.

  Kijimunas take pleasure in two pastimes: fishing and playing pranks. When a kijimuna grows distracted from its catch, it seeks out targets for its practical jokes. These hijinks often prove relatively harmless, but some escalate to the point of becoming injurious or potentially lethal. Most kijimunas genuinely do not understand how their “play” frustrates, harms, or otherwise impacts the targets of their tricks and are insulted when victims become angry rather than seeing the comedy of the situation. The insulted kijimunas then take retribution the only way they know how: with more elaborate pranks.

  A kijimuna stands only about 3 feet tall and weighs approximately 50 pounds. Its size belies its sinewy strength, gained from years of fishing and climbing tall banyan trees.
