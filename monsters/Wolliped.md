##### Description

Some claim wollipeds weren’t initially domesticated to

be working animals, but rather were herded and bred for

their extremely warm and plentiful f leece. Regardless of

the creatures’ origins, arctic dwellers have a long history

of using these magnificent animals for many purposes,

even employing them as mounts in battle. A typical

_wolliped_ stands between 5 and 6 feet at the front shoulder

and weighs upward of 1,000 pounds.

Wollipeds are social herd animals that subsist on a diet

of grasses, leaves, and other plant material. Wollipeds in

high mountainous environments obtain much of their

food from lichens and mosses, while herds of wollipeds on

the plains graze on more substantial fare. Wild wollipeds

tend to migrate to more plentiful foraging lands in the

harshest winters, though these can be difficult to find.

Walking on eight sturdy legs, wollipeds are exceptionally

_[[feats/Sure-Footed|sure-footed]]_. These creatures can _climb_ steep mountain

trails and march through heavy snow with little effort,

and arctic cavalry have often charged up scree-choked

hillsides to raid fortresses on the backs of armored

wollipeds. The great beasts’ facility at maneuvering in

challenging environments, as well as their generally

submissive nature, have resulted in a long relationship

with the humanoids that share their homes. Wollipeds

live for about 15 years, mating and giving birth

every 11 months, and can be ridden until the

final month of pregnancy.

Wollipeds are social animals, grouping

together into herds for protection. When

threatened, wollipeds gather in a tight

cluster with the young animals in the

very center of the herd. Domesticated

wollipeds are used for casual riding,

pulling plows, and powering mills.

_Wolliped_ f leece is a versatile

textile, as _wolliped_ fibers

wick water away, and still

provide adequate warmth

even when soaked. The

variations in their coat

colors and textures provide

weavers with a wide array

of design options.

Wollipeds are known

to use spitting as a form

of communication, as well

as a method of defense. Most

wollipeds only spit at one another,

typically in the course of their tusk-clashing

shows of dominance, but when threatened,

they can launch a nauseating wad of partially

digested food at their attackers to sicken and

distract them.
