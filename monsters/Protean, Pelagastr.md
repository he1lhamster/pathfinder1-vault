# Protean, Pelagastr
This glittering serpent’s body ends in a looping length of tail. Its

scales glow softly in ever-changing patterns.

### Special Abilities

**_Change Shape_ (Su)** When a pelagastr changes shape, it remains _incorporeal_ in its assumed form.

**Overshadowing Ego (Su)** Once per round as a standard action, the pelagastr can merge its body with that of a corporeal creature. This ability is similar to a greater _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_ spell (caster level equals the protean’s Hit Dice). To use this ability, the pelagastr must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 19 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same pelagastr’s overshadowing ego for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
**Spirit Coils (Su)** A pelagastr’s bite and claw attacks resolve as touch attacks and deal force damage, but its tail slap attack resolves normally and deals bludgeoning damage, as the tail dips into reality when attacking; this also allows it to _constrict_ and grapple foes. The pelagastr always adds 1-1/2 times its Charisma modifier to damage dealt by its tail slap and treats its Charisma score as its effective Strength score should its tail’s ability to lift or drag objects come into play.

**Warpwave (Su)** A creature that takes damage from a pelagastr’s _constrict_ ability must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be affected by a warpwave (see page 307). To determine the effects of a pelagastr’s warpwave, roll 1d12 and consult the warpwave effect table on page 306. The save DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

Just as other proteans delight in bringing change to subvert the awful stagnancy of the physical world, pelagastrs are dedicated to inviting chaos and _freedom_ into the dull, stale lives of its inhabitants. Unrestrained by the limits of a physical body, they spy on private spaces and secrets, and hop from host to host to savor the strangeness of the physical world using as many senses as possible.
