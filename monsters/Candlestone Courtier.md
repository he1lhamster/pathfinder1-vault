special_abilities:
  Fey Bargain (Su): Once per week, a Candlestone courtier can grant a limited wish
    or a permanent +2 inherent bonus to one ability score. In exchange, the bargainer
    is cursed to be carried off in its dreams each night by the courtier to a never-ending
    fey ball that, while pleasant as often as not, affects the dreamer as nightmare,
    requiring a saving throw each night (Will DC 21 negates). The DC to remove this
    curse is reduced by 4 if the courtier is killed, and a successful coup de grace
    on the courtier with a cold iron weapon automatically ends the curse. Ending the
    curse also ends any noninstantaneous effects of the bargain. A creature can have
    only one fey bargain at a time.
  Spellthrust (Su): When a courtier threatens a critical hit, it can trigger a spell-like
    ability with a range of touch against the target. If the critical hit is confirmed,
    the target must save twice, using the lower result.
desc_long: Candlestone courtiers are emissaries of Queen Frilogarma and the Court
  of Ether. Venturing up from their Darklands domain, they make deals to the benefit
  of their queen, forge secret alliances with citizens of foreign lands, and inveigle
  mortals into endless revels in the inverted fey city while sapping the vitality
  of their victims to sate their alien appetites. Candlestone courtiers prefer to
  employ trickery and extortion over direct violence, but don't shy away from a fight
  if it is the fastest way to get what they want.
