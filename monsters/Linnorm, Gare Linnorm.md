title1: Linnorm, Gare Linnorm
desc_short: An enormous draconic head rises up atop a massive serpentine neck wider
  than a galleon's mainmast. Seemingly endless coils break the water's surface around
  it, only hinting at the monster's terrifying size, as it opens its steam-shrouded
  maw with a hiss.

  Breath Weapon (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a gare linnorm can
    breathe a 60-foot cone of scalding steam, dealing 17d8 points of fire damage to
    all creatures struck (Reflex DC 25 halves). This steam then hangs in the air for
    1 round after the linnorm creates it. Creatures in the area of effect or that
    enter the area take an additional 6d6 points of fire damage the second round (Reflex
    DC 25 negates). In addition, the cloud of steam acts as the spell solid fog, with
    a caster level equal to the linnorm's HD. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Death Curse (Su): |-
    When a creature slays a gare linnorm, the slayer is affected by the curse of the drowning gasp.

    Curse of the Drowning Gasp: save Will DC 22; effect anytime the creature imbibes a liquid of any kind, its lungs fill with water and it begins to drown. Treat this as the spell suffocation* (DC 19 Fort save to resist), with a caster level equal to the linnorm's Hit Dice. The save DC for the curse is Charisma-based. * See page 248 of the Advanced Player's Guide.
  Freedom of Movement (Ex): A gare linnorm is under the constant effect of freedom
    of movement, as the spell of the same name. This effect cannot be dispelled.
  Poison (Su): Bite-injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect
    3d6 fire damage and 1d6 Dex drain; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  True Seeing (Ex): A gare linnorm has true seeing, as the spell of the same name.
    This effect cannot be dispelled.
desc_long: |-
  So named for a northern word for “river,” a gare linnorm's body resembles that of a gigantic serpent, save for two muscular forelimbs. The creature's head is long and angular, with crests that it uses to break through ice in its never-ending search for food. A gare linnorm's hide is a dull gray color akin to tarnished silver, with a slightly paler underbelly. Unlike many linnorms, a gare linnorm has a smooth hide, allowing it to slip easily through water and ice holes.

  A gare linnorm can grow as long as 60 feet, typically weighs 11,000 pounds, and can live for over 1,000 years.
