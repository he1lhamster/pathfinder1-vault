  Freeze (Ex): A formless spawn can hold itself so still that it appears to be nothing
    more than a puddle of tar or oil. When using this ability, a formless spawn can
    take 20 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as just such a puddle. While
    freezing, a spawn need not drink or eat.
  Improved Swallow Whole (Ex): When a creature cuts its way out of a formless spawn
    after being swallowed whole, the monster's fluid body reforms instantly, allowing
    it to continue to use swallow whole without needing to completely recover from
    all damage.
  Tendrils (Ex): A formless spawn fills an area around it to a 20-foot radius with
    a writhing storm of black tendrils formed from its own amorphous body. These tendrils
    grant it a +5 deflection bonus to AC and other creatures in this area take a -5
    penalty on combat maneuver checks. Freedom of movement grants immunity to this
    combat maneuver penalty, and the tendrils cannot penalize creatures that are gaseous
    or incorporeal.
  Tentacles (Ex): A formless spawn's tentacles always function as primary natural
    weapons. As it deals damage with a tentacle, a formless spawn can decide whether
    it is dealing bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage.
desc_long: |-
  Oozes are much-feared denizens of the Darklands, yet many of them share characteristics that canny adventurers can exploit. The two best known are their mindlessness (a feature that lets an experienced adventurer manipulate the ooze in a battle, due to its inability to use tactics) and their lack of armor (a quality that allows for tactics like Power Attack to be used with abandon). However, those who stumble across one of the so-called formless spawn of Tsathoggua would do well to remember that not all oozes are mindless and easily hit in combat, for these deadly guardians prove quite cunning and display an alacrity that grants them incredible defenses against physical attacks.

  A formless spawn at rest resembles nothing more than a simple puddle of tar, oil, or another dark, thick liquid; once roused to attack, however, it could never be mistaken for anything other than a monstrous and malignant predator. The creature's outline changes constantly, shifting from serpentine to insectile to a truly shapeless mass-at times even approximating humanoid or other bestial shapes before collapsing in on itself a moment later. Always, the formless spawn sends forth a storm of tendrils that whip and writhe, blocking attacks and fouling attempts at combat maneuvers. The creatures can speak if they deign to, yet they rarely bother to do so with creatures that have fixed shapes-formless spawn consider talking to one's food a waste of time.

  A formless spawn is elephantine in size, capable of covering a 15-foot-diameter pool to a depth of a foot, and it weighs just over 9,000 pounds. Even at this weight, a formless spawn is only about as dense as oil and thus floats on water, unless it actively swims down under the surface.

The two best known are their mindlessness (a feature that lets an experienced adventurer manipulate the ooze in a battle, due to its inability to use tactics) and their lack of armor (a quality that allows for tactics like _Power Attack_ to be used with abandon). However, those who stumble across one of the so-called _formless spawn_ of Tsathoggua would do well to remember that not all oozes are mindless and easily hit in combat, for these _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ guardians prove quite _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cunning|cunning]]_ and display an alacrity that grants them incredible defenses against physical attacks.

A _formless spawn_ at rest resembles nothing more than a simple puddle of tar, oil, or another dark, thick liquid; once roused to attack, however, it could never be mistaken for anything other than a monstrous and malignant predator. The creature’s outline changes constantly, shifting from serpentine to insectile to a truly shapeless mass—at times even approximating humanoid or other bestial shapes before collapsing in on itself a moment later.
