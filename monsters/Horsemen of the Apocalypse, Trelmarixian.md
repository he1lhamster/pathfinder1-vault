# Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Trelmarixian
This starving-thin man has a trio of _[[monsters/Jackal|jackal]]_’s heads with jagged,

crystalline teeth. His oily black flesh ripples disturbingly.

### Special Abilities

**Predecessor’s _Rage_ (Su)** Trelmarixian consumed the previous Horseman of _[[curses/Famine|Famine]]_, and portions of that previous Horseman’s essence still exist within Trelmarixian’s belly, being slowly digested like a sweet, spiritual lozenge. This previous Horseman was herself a parasitic entity, and once per hour as an immediate action, Trelmarixian can lower his _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ to his predecessor’s _rage_ to allow her to infuse him with fury from within. When Trelmarixian does so, he gains the effects of _[[spells/Righteous Might|righteous might]]_, and his _regeneration_ increases to 30 for 4 rounds. When this effect ends, Trelmarixian is _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1d4+1 rounds if he fails a DC 35 Fortitude save, or for only 1 round if he succeeds.

**_Ravenous_ _Devourer_ (Ex)** Trelmarixian’s bite attacks always apply 1-1/2 × his Strength modifier to his damage.
**_Swallow Whole_ (Su)** Trelmarixian’s _swallow whole_ ability is a supernatural ability that can affect Huge or smaller creatures, despite the fact that Trelmarixian is only _Medium_. His stomach functions similarly to an extradimensional space and can hold any number of creatures. If Trelmarixian swallows an object that contains an extradimensional space (such as a bag of holding or a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Portable Hole|portable hole]]_), that object cannot be opened while it is within the Horseman of _Famine_’s belly, but it does not otherwise interact with his stomach in a destructive way.

**Wail of the Consumed (Su)** Trelmarixian can, as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, call upon the tattered fragments of the innumerable souls he has consumed to unleash a mind-shattering wail. This affects all creatures within a 60-foot spread. Affected creatures take 1d10 points of Wisdom drain and are _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_ for 1 round. A creature that succeeds at a DC 36 Will save instead takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage and is _staggered_ for 1 round. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

##### Description

The youngest but perhaps most ambitious of the Four, Trelmarixian the Black obsesses over soul _[[feats/Consumption|consumption]]_, riding the line between brutal, amoral science and quasi-religious zealotry. A perpetually _ravenous_ shapeshifting horror, Trelmarixian maintains a three headed humanoid shape—but only just, with his frame constantly shuddering and shifting and threatening to slump into a protoplasmic slurry of bile, blood, and mucus. Trelmarixian was once a meladaemon himself, and his meladaemon servitors, while always emaciated and bestial, have become more canine in appearance under his rule. When the so-called Lysogenic Prince rose to power, he overthrew and consumed his predecessor, but he maintains a fragment of her existence within him to fuel periodic bouts of parasitic _rage_.

Trelmarixian embodies not only starvation, but also the broader concept of wasting, both physical and metaphysical, particularly the lingering dooms of cancer, parasitism, and spiritual decay. Like the viral afflictions he represents, the Horseman of _Famine_ behaves like his chosen concept in a concrete manner, having secretively inserted fragments of his physical form into many of his servitors. This bombards him with sensory information on a truly maddening scale, and thus Trelmarixian’s fragmented mind brims with _insanity_ and a multitude of voices, including that of his predecessor. He still adores her in his own fashion, and she in turn speaks to him, advising as she sees fit or mocking his shortcomings like an aggressive, self-aware conscience. By force of will, he can _[[spells/Silence|silence]]_ the voices, but the thing that haunts him more than any of these cannot be so easily dismissed. Most daemons retain only fractured, fragmented recollections of their mortal life. Trelmarixian, on the other hand, remembers everything save for the last few minutes of his life. As a mortal, daemon-blooded _[[monsters/Tiefling|tiefling]]_, Trelmarixian exterminated all life on his world with a work of profound sorcery, but in doing so he condemned himself to starvation. Near the moment of his agonizing death, he recalls someone talking to him, asking him questions and mocking his success as paltry compared to what awaited him after death. Despite his _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ of everyone he had ever known in life, someone was there, and he cannot remember that person’s face or final words.

Trelmarixian’s memories haunt him still, as does the question of whose blood his soul carried, and thus who may still have some _[[monsters/Unknown|unknown]]_ claim on him, such as a long-dead Horseman of _Famine_. He’s likewise haunted by the notion that he was born to be the vector for his progenitor’s return—one virus within another, waiting and incubating, to someday express itself and snuff him out as he did his own predecessor.

Trelmarixian’s domain, the Withered Court, is a realm of biological and metaphysical horrors, towers spun from flesh and bone with mortal souls used like living, screaming bricks, each mournfully crying out in the constant pangs of starvation. In this realm of horrors, his servitors devour as much as they craft, warping souls into nightmarish wonders while their master continues his nihilistic work within his citadel, the miles-high _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Weeping|Weeping]]_ Tower.
