  Icy Aura (Su): Misty vapors roil from the Black Rider to a distance of 10 feet.
    Any creatures in contact with the vapors must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save
    or be slowed as per the slow spell. Once affected, the creature remains slowed
    as long as it is in the aura and for 1 round afterward. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Rider's Robes (Su): The Black Rider wears robes that provide the same protection
    as full plate armor.
  Rider's Weapon (Su): Whenever the Black Rider successfully confirms a critical hit
    with his +2 icy burst spear, the target is stunned for 1 round unless it succeeds
    at a DC 24 Fortitude save. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: The Black Rider has the most forbidding appearance of the Three Riders.
  He always appears in a frightening form when called to service. His judgments are
  the least recorded in history, as they are all performed under the cover of night,
  and many Irriseni citizens blame other vicious creatures and strange occurrences
  for the disappearance of their fellow citizens.
