special_abilities:
  Mindshock (Su): Whenever a grioth damages a creature with a psychic weapon, a surge
    of violent psychic energy pulses into the victim's body, causing an additional
    1d4 points of nonlethal damage. On a confirmed critical hit, this additional nonlethal
    damage does not increase, but the creature struck must succeed at a DC 13 Will
    save or become confused for 1d2 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save
    DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
  Poison (Ex): Bite-injury; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect
    shaken for 1 round; cure 1 save.
  Psychic Weapons (Ex): A grioth's weapons are made from a strange metal that causes
    slashing and piercing weapons to deal 1 additional point of damage and allow the
    grioth to use its mindshock ability.
desc_long: |-
  Grioths inhabit rogue planets cast away from their stars-often, they travel to other worlds via powerful magic portals during eclipses to pillage resources rare on their frozen homeworlds. Many of these evil creatures are known for their devotion to the Outer God Nyarlathotep (whom they worship in his guise as the Haunter of the Dark), and it isn't uncommon for colonies of grioths to be led by clerics.

   Grioths speak a language composed of squeaks, clicks, and other nonsensical animal noises-they are capable of speaking other languages, but do so in raspy, dry voices. They favor weaponry crafted from metals that synergize with their psychic powers.

   The grioth race is prone to mutations, their forms twisted by eldritch forces into lumbering giants or deformed horrors. The most powerful of their kind often possess great physical prowess, as well as unique psychic magic or spell-like abilities that aid them in ruling their dark spire cities and in their constant wars against entities even more alien than themselves.

##### Description

Grioths inhabit _[[classes/Rogue|rogue]]_ planets cast away from their stars—often, they travel to other worlds via powerful magic portals during eclipses to pillage resources rare on their frozen homeworlds. Many of these evil creatures are known for their devotion to the Outer God Nyarlathotep (whom they worship in his guise as the Haunter of the Dark), and it isn’t uncommon for colonies of grioths to be led by clerics.

Grioths speak a language composed of squeaks, clicks, and other nonsensical animal noises—they are capable of speaking other languages, but do so in raspy, dry voices. They favor weaponry crafted from metals that synergize with their _psychic_ powers.

The _grioth_ race is _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ to mutations, their forms twisted by eldritch forces into lumbering giants or deformed horrors. The most powerful of their kind often possess great physical prowess, as well as unique _psychic magic_ or _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ that aid them in ruling their dark spire cities and in their constant wars against entities even more alien than themselves.
