  Aura of Misfortune (Su): A chernobue radiates an aura of evil malaise to a radius
    of 30 feet. All lawful or good creatures in this area take a -1 penalty on attack
    rolls and weapon damage rolls. Lawful good creatures take a -3 penalty and upon
    first entering the aura must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be sickened for as
    long as they remain in the area. This ability is Charisma-based.
  Horrific Appearance (Su): Creatures that succumb to a chernobue's horrific appearance
    become paralyzed with disgust for 2d6 rounds; a paralyzed creature gets a new
    save each round to recover from the effect, provided he is no longer aware of
    the chernobue or within 30 feet of it.
  Light Vulnerability (Ex): A chernobue within an area of bright light takes 1 point
    of Constitution damage per minute it remains in the area.
  Poison (Su): Bite-injury; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect
    1d2 Con drain; cure 1 save. The thick, orange poison injected by a chernobue is
    semi-alive. As soon as the poisoned victim is cured of the poison (by making a
    save, being targeted with an effect like neutralize poison, or enduring the full
    duration of the poison), the orange fluid bursts from the victim's body, causing
    1d6 Charisma damage and rendering the victim unconscious for 2d6 rounds unless
    he makes a final DC 23 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: The chernobue is a living manifestation of the vile fecundity of the Abyss-a
  monstrous, alien pregnancy made flesh. By infecting creatures with the Abyssal taint
  they carry, they spread pain and misfortune wherever they flop and writhe-and with
  their plane shift ability, they are ready to spread their filth throughout the multiverse.
  A chernobue is 13 feet long and weighs 500 pounds.
