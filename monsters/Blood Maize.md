  Blinding Bloom (Ex): Once per day as a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks
    of opportunity, a blood maize plant can release a stationary, 20-foot-high cloud
    of fine pollen in a 20-foot radius centered on its square. The cloud acts as an
    obscuring mist spell, but it lasts for 1 round, after which it dissipates. A creature
    in the cloud when the pollen is released or that moves into the cloud before it
    dissipates must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude saving throw or be blinded for 1
    round. The saving throw DC is Charisma-based.
  Change Foliage (Su): Three times per day as an immediate action that does not provoke
    attacks of opportunity, a blood maize plant can make itself appear as a different
    type of plant. This new appearance mimics that of any plant up to two size categories
    smaller than the blood maize and need not resemble the blood maize's true form.
    For example, the blood maize can take on the semblance of a pumpkin vine, strawberry
    plant, or sunflower. A blood maize plant's statistics remain the same, even if
    it is masquerading as a plant of a smaller size category. It can't assume the
    form of another plant creature and can imitate only the appearance of plants that
    are normally considered part of the surrounding terrain. This effect is a visual
    illusion only and does not alter the perceived scent or tactile properties of
    the blood maize. While using this ability, the blood maize gains a +10 racial
    bonus on Stealth checks. A successful DC 20 Knowledge (nature) or Survival check
    is required to identify the plant's true nature. A creature that interacts with
    a blood maize plant while it is using this ability can disbelieve the illusion
    with a successful DC 13 Will saving throw. Changing back into its true form requires
    an immediate action. This is an illusion (glamer) effect. The saving throw DC
    is Charisma-based.
  Root Deep (Ex): As a free action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, a
    blood maize plant can use its long hooklike appendage to root itself deep into
    dirt or soil, but not into rock or other harder materials. This grants the blood
    maize a +4 racial bonus against bull rush or trip attempts.
desc_long: 'Named not for their physical coloration but for their thirst for spilled
  blood, the plants known as blood maize plants are insidious creatures. They look
  like common cornstalks, except their leaves are larger and more knifelike and their
  root systems are much more robust and mobile. In each specimen, the latter includes
  at least one long vine-like tendril that the plant can use to root itself deeply
  in the earth as it attacks its victim. Despite its fearsome nature, blood maize
  produces ears of sweet corn larger than those of traditional corn plants. A full-grown
  blood maize stalk is typically 7 feet tall and, including its root system, weighs
  about 70 pounds. '

### Special Abilities

**_Blinding_ Bloom (Ex)** Once per day as a standard action that doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity, a _[[monsters/Blood Maize|blood maize]]_ plant can release a stationary, 20-foot-high cloud of fine pollen in a 20-foot radius centered on its square. The cloud acts as an _[[spells/Obscuring Mist|obscuring mist]]_ spell, but it lasts for 1 round, after which it dissipates. A creature in the cloud when the pollen is released or that moves into the cloud before it dissipates must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude saving throw or be _[[conditions/Blinded|blinded]]_ for 1 round. The saving throw DC is Charisma-based.

**Change Foliage (Su)** Three times per day as an immediate action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, a _blood maize_ plant can make itself appear as a different type of plant. This new appearance mimics that of any plant up to two size categories smaller than the _blood maize_ and need not resemble the _blood maize_’s _[[spells/True Form|true form]]_. For example, the _blood maize_ can take on the semblance of a pumpkin vine, strawberry plant, or sunflower. A _blood maize_ plant’s statistics remain the same, even if it is masquerading as a plant of a smaller size category. It can’t assume the form of another plant creature and can imitate only the appearance of plants that are normally considered part of the surrounding terrain. This effect is a visual illusion only and does not alter the perceived _[[universal monster rules/Scent|scent]]_ or tactile properties of the _blood maize_. While using this ability, the _blood maize_ gains a +10 racial bonus on Stealth checks. A successful DC 20 Knowledge (nature) or Survival check is required to _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ the plant’s true nature. A creature that interacts with a _blood maize_ plant while it is using this ability can disbelieve the illusion with a successful DC 13 Will saving throw.

##### Description

Named not for their physical coloration but for their thirst for spilled blood, the plants known as _blood maize_ plants are insidious creatures. They look like common cornstalks, except their leaves are larger and more knifelike and their _root_ systems are much more robust and mobile. In each specimen, the latter includes at least one long vine-like tendril that the plant can use to _root_ itself deeply in the earth as it attacks its victim. Despite its fearsome nature, _blood maize_ produces ears of sweet corn larger than those of traditional corn plants. A full-grown _blood maize_ stalk is typically 7 feet tall and, including its _root_ system, weighs about 70 pounds.
