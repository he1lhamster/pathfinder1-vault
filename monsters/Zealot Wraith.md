    its god. A holy symbol does not harm a zealot wraith; it merely keeps the wraith
    at bay. A recoiling zealot wraith must stay at least 5 feet away from a strongly
    presented holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against the creature
    presenting it. Holding a zealot wraith at bay with a holy symbol requires a standard
    action. After 1 round, the zealot wraith can overcome its revulsion and function
    normally each round it succeeds at a DC 25 Will save.

The souls of these forsaken priests were unable to pass on, and they now prowl the site of their deaths as incorporeal undead known as zealot wraiths. These restless shades harbor a hatred for the living, and their touch inflicts a curse that embodies their sense of sorrow and self-doubt.

  Anytime a cleric or devout follower of a deity dies in the throes of doubt or a sense of disappointment in her god, she risks becoming a zealot wraith. Although now undead horrors, such wraiths were once devoted believers of their gods; this heritage manifests as an aversion to their deities' holy symbols (whether or not wielded by a worshiper of the associated god). As such, zealot wraiths pose little threat to those living souls who shared their faith but who did not succumb to the same tragedies that resulted in the wraith's creation, leaving the undead ironically impotent in the temples and holy sites they frequently haunt.

  Arodenite zealot wraiths are common in the ruins of Deng and are occasionally spotted in destroyed Arodenite chapels in Westcrown. Zealot wraiths of other faiths, including those of Easivra, Lissala, and Ydersius can be found throughout the Inner Sea region.

##### Description

When Aroden died, natural disasters wracked Avistan. Priests of Aroden killed in such disasters often died with overwhelming feelings of _[[spells/Confusion|confusion]]_, sorrow, and betrayal as their prayers for succor went unanswered; for some, their sense of doubt and injustice overwhelmed their faith at the moments of their deaths. The souls of these forsaken priests were unable to pass on, and they now prowl the site of their deaths as _incorporeal_ undead known as zealot wraiths. These restless _[[spells/Shades|shades]]_ harbor a hatred for the living, and their touch inflicts a curse that embodies their sense of sorrow and self-doubt.

Anytime a _cleric_ or devout follower of a deity dies in the throes of doubt or a sense of disappointment in her god, she risks becoming a _zealot wraith_. Although now undead horrors, such wraiths were once devoted believers of their gods; this heritage manifests as an _[[spells/Aversion|aversion]]_ to their deities’ holy symbols (whether or not wielded by a worshiper of the associated god). As such, zealot wraiths pose little threat to those living souls who shared their faith but who did not succumb to the same tragedies that resulted in the _wraith_’s creation, leaving the undead ironically impotent in the temples and holy sites they frequently haunt.

Arodenite zealot wraiths are common in the ruins of Deng and are occasionally spotted in destroyed Arodenite chapels in Westcrown. Zealot wraiths of other faiths, including those of Easivra, Lissala, and Ydersius can be found throughout the Inner Sea region.
