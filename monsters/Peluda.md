  Quill Barrage (Ex): Three times per day, a peluda can fire dozens of spearlike barbs
    in all directions. All creatures within 15 feet take 6d6 points of piercing damage
    (Reflex DC 20 half) and are subject to its poison quills. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Quills (Ex): A peluda's back and tail are covered in sharp black quills. A creature
    that strikes a peluda with a melee weapon, an unarmed attack, or a natural weapon
    takes 1d6 points of piercing damage from the peluda's quills and risks being poisoned.
    Weapons with reach do not endanger an attacker in this way. Any creature that
    grapples a peluda takes 3d6 points of piercing damage and risks being poisoned
    on its turn each round.
  Vulnerable Tail (Su): A peluda is vulnerable to attacks against its tail. Any attack
    that is not an attempt to sever the peluda's tail (including area attacks or attacks
    that cause piercing or bludgeoning damage) affects its body. To sever the tail,
    an opponent must target the tail and attempt a sunder combat maneuver with a slashing
    weapon. The tail is considered a separate weapon with hardness 5 and hit points
    equal to the peluda's HD. The opponent must deal enough damage on a single blow
    to reduce the tail's hit points to 0 or fewer. If the tail is severed, the peluda
    can no longer attack with it and takes 2d6 points of bleed damage each round.
desc_long: |-
  Peludas loathe all weak, fragile creatures smaller than themselves, especially humanoids. Some hunt in nearby farmlands before returning to their own lairs. Some are worshipped as gods by lizardfolk or other swamp creatures, though a peluda's short temper means it may eat its devotees if affronted.

  A typical peluda is 15 feet long and weighs 300 pounds.
