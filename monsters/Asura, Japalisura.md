special_abilities:
  Dual Bows (Ex): A japalisura can simultaneously wield two bows of any type. When
    it makes a full attack with both bows, the penalties for fighting with two weapons
    apply and can be offset with feats such as Two-Weapon Fighting. The japalisura
    can apply extra attacks from other sources, such as Manyshot or Rapid Shot, to
    only one of its bows per round. For the purpose of calculating the penalties for
    fighting with two weapons, a japalisura treats shortbows and composite shortbows
    as light weapons, and it treats other bows as one-handed weapons.
  Hateful Prophecy (Sp): A japalisura can cast augury or divination for a willing
    creature, in which case the spell provides information that pertains to that creature's
    future rather than that of the asura. Upon completing the casting of the spell-like
    ability, the japalisura can attempt a Profession (soothsayer) check opposed by
    the creature's Sense Motive check. If successful, the japalisura twists the prophecy
    in such a way to convey impending violence or betrayal, subjecting the creature
    to the effects of vengeful outrage with an indicated enemy of the asura's choice.
    The creature can resist the vengeful outrage effect with a successful DC 20 Will
    saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based. Infernal Arrows (Su) As a swift action,
    a japalisura with at least one free hand can create 10 mundane arrows. It can
    have no more than 20 such arrows in existence at a time, and its arrows are always
    destroyed when fired, whether they hit their target or not. Selective Nondetection
    (Su) A japalisura automatically succeeds at caster level checks to bypass its
    elusive aura.
desc_long: |-
  Thinking her divine realm so glorious that all must envy it, a goddess once sought a powerful oracle to identify her enemies. The oracle told her that she had no reason to fear invaders, for her death and ruin would come from the covetous barbs of enemies within. Distressed, the goddess returned to her palace, scoured her halls for any such traitors, and at last came upon her three demigod children practicing archery. Certain that her children would one day slay her, she tore them to pieces and cast their bodies and bows far from her realm. The first japalisura formed from these eviscerated remains.

   A japalisura is 7 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.

##### Description

Thinking her divine realm so _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Glorious|glorious]]_ that all must envy it, a goddess once sought a powerful _[[classes/Oracle|oracle]]_ to _[[spells/Identify|identify]]_ her enemies. The _oracle_ told her that she had no reason to _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ invaders, for her death and ruin would come from the covetous barbs of enemies within. Distressed, the goddess returned to her palace, scoured her halls for any such traitors, and at last came upon her three demigod children practicing archery. Certain that her children would one day slay her, she tore them to pieces and cast their bodies and bows far from her realm. The first japalisura formed from these eviscerated remains.

A japalisura is 7 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.
