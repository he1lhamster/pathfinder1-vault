  Giant ants are as industrious as their normal-sized kin. While their nests generally don't consist of thousands, their greatly increased size more than compensates.

  The statistics given above are for soldier ants-the variety most commonly encountered. The following simple templates can be used to create variants of the standard soldier ant.

  Worker (-1 CR) Worker ants do not have a poison sting attack or a grab special attack.

  Drone (+1 CR) Drones have the advanced simple template and a fly speed of 30 feet (average).

  Queen (+2 CR) The queen of a nest is an immense, bloated creature. She gains the advanced and the giant simple templates, but drops her speed to 10 feet and loses her climb speed entirely.

##### Description

Giant ants are as industrious as their normal-sized kin. While their nests generally don’t consist of thousands, their greatly increased size more than compensates.

The statistics given above are for soldier ants—the variety most commonly encountered. The following simple templates can be used to create variants of the standard soldier ant.

**Worker (–1 CR) **Worker ants do not have a poison sting attack or a _grab_ special attack.

**Drone (+1 CR) **Drones have the advanced simple template and a fly speed of 30 feet (average).

**Queen (+2 CR) **The queen of a nest is an immense, bloated creature. She gains the advanced and the giant simple templates, but drops her speed to 10 feet and loses her _climb_ speed entirely.
