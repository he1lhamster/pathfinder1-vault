  Absorb Dying Creature (Su): A warsworn can consume any dying creature by moving
    into the same space. This immediately kills the creature, absorbs the corpse into
    the warsworn, and heals the warsworn by an amount equal to the creature's Constitution
    score. Absorbed corpses can't be resurrected by any effect short of a miracle
    or wish until the warsworn that consumed them is destroyed.
  Profane Magic (Su): Protection from evil blocks attacks from a warsworn's spell-like
    abilities. Weapons animated by the warsworn are damaged by channeled energy as
    if undead.
  Scrap Ball (Ex): The warsworn can throw a mass of broken weapons and armor. This
    deals an amount of damage equal to 2d6 + the warsworn's Strength modifier, and
    has a range increment of 20 feet.
desc_long: |-
  Warsworns are massive undead amalgams, their evershifting, chaotic bodies composed of countless slain soldiers and their armor and weapons. The shambling, serpentine form of a warsworn creates a grotesque, metallic cacophony as the weapons and armor of countless souls clash as though still in the throes of a never-ending battle. A warsworn forms by the will of a god or goddess of undeath or war, or spontaneously from the bloodlust and wrath of a battlefield of dead soldiers. Once created, a warsworn exists to spread the rage of war, ravage the land, and spread the carnage of battle.

  A typical warsworn weighs several tons and can reach a height of up to 25 feet. A newly formed one is much smaller, but quickly consumes nearby corpses from a battlefield or mass grave and swells to its full size. It is always hungry for more dying bodies. It prefers to absorb warriors and soldiers, but willingly consumes any suitable humanoid. Its constant grinding motion breaks its component parts, giving it plenty of scrap to hurl at distant foes.

##### Description

Warsworns are massive undead amalgams, their evershifting, chaotic bodies composed of countless slain soldiers and their armor and weapons. The shambling, serpentine form of a _warsworn_ creates a grotesque, metallic cacophony as the weapons and armor of countless souls clash as though still in the throes of a never-ending battle. A _warsworn_ forms by the will of a god or goddess of undeath or war, or spontaneously from the bloodlust and wrath of a battlefield of dead soldiers. Once created, a _warsworn_ exists to spread the _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ of war, ravage the land, and spread the carnage of battle.

A typical _warsworn_ weighs several tons and can reach a height of up to 25 feet. A newly formed one is much smaller, but quickly consumes nearby corpses from a battlefield or mass grave and swells to its full size. It is always hungry for more _dying_ bodies. It prefers to absorb warriors and soldiers, but willingly consumes any suitable humanoid. Its constant _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Grinding|grinding]]_ motion breaks its component parts, giving it plenty of scrap to hurl at distant foes.
