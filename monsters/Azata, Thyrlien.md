  Fast Healing (Ex): A thyrlien has fast healing 1 only when outside under a night
    sky (whether the sky is cloudy or clear).
  Poison (Ex): Bite-injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect
    1d3 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  Starlight Blast (Su): As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a thyrlien can
    tap into Desna's divine radiance and unleash a blast of holy twilight in a 5-foot
    burst. All creatures in this area take 2d4 points of holy damage, plus 1 point
    for each step their alignment deviates from chaotic good. For example, a chaotic
    neutral or neutral good creature would take 2d4+1 points of damage, a neutral
    creature would take 2d4+2 points of damage, and a lawful evil creature would take
    2d4+4 points of damage. A DC 14 Reflex save negates this damage. Chaotic good
    creatures are unaffected by this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: A thyrlien is a unique type of azata created by Desna. Intended as rare
  warrior counterparts to lyrakien, thyrlien are tasked with watching over nighttime
  travelers. Specifically hunting the servants of Lamashtu and Ghlaunder, thyrlien
  wander lonely roads and dark alleys, hoping to confront or counter the dark things
  that so often hunt such ominous spots. Superficially humanoid, a thyrlien's attacks
  reveal its nonhuman origins. Venomous saliva coats mouth and its delicatelooking
  wings are actually as stiff as wood and have razor sharp edges. A thyrlien is skilled
  at tracking using conventional and magical methods and is savvy to the ways of its
  chosen prey. These servants of the goddess of luck stand about 2 feet tall and weigh
  around 15 pounds.
