  Alien Anatomy (Ex): A narrik's internal organs are composed of a viscous goo, rendering
    them immune to precision damage (including sneak attacks) and bleed damage.
  Death Throes (Ex): When a narrik is slain, its internal alchemy begins a violent
    chain reaction. 1d3 rounds after death, a narrik's corpse erupts, spraying all
    creatures within 5 feet with narrik poison (Reflex DC 18 negates; see below).
  Poison (Ex): Bite or tanglespit-contact; save Fort DC 19; frequency 1/round for
    6 rounds; effect 1 Wisdom damage and shaken for 1 minute; cure 2 consecutive saves.
    A shaken target becomes frightened, and a frightened target becomes panicked.
    The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Tanglespit (Ex): As a ranged touch attack, a narrik can spit a glob of viscous,
    psychotropic saliva at a single creature within 30 feet. Creatures struck by tanglespit
    become entangled, and must succeed at a DC 18 Reflex saving throw or be glued
    to the floor; a flying creature must succeed at a DC 18 Reflex saving throw or
    be unable to fly. A creature glued in place may break free with a successful DC
    18 Strength check, by inflicting 15 points of damage to the spit with a slashing
    weapon, or by dissolving the adhesive with at least a pint of alcohol or an application
    of universal solvent. Tanglespit becomes fragile and brittle after 2d4 rounds,
    freeing any entangled creature.
  Taste Fear (Ex): Narriks taste the subtleties of their surroundings, especially
    the fear of other creatures, effectively granting them blindsight to detect all
    creatures suffering the shaken, frightened, or panicked conditions within 60 feet.
desc_long: 'In the lightless tunnels leading between Darklands settlements and to
  surface entrances, packs of narriks stalk their favored prey: terrified sentient
  beings. Their bodies are bizarre, alchemical laboratories that naturally produce
  a cocktail of potent venom and hallucinogenic pheromones, as well as a sticky saliva
  in which they trap their victims. Nearly blind, a narrik's cluster of eyespots atop
  its body allows it to only detect light and movement, and the aberration hunts almost
  entirely by scent, especially savoring the heady aroma of terror.'

Tanglespit becomes fragile and brittle after 2d4 rounds, freeing any _entangled_ creature.

**Taste _Fear_ (Ex)** Narriks taste the subtleties of their surroundings, especially the _fear_ of other creatures, effectively granting them _[[universal monster rules/Blindsight|blindsight]]_ to detect all creatures suffering the _shaken_, _frightened_, or _panicked_ conditions within 60 feet.

##### Description

In the lightless tunnels leading between Darklands settlements and to surface entrances, packs of narriks stalk their favored prey: terrified sentient beings. Their bodies are bizarre, alchemical laboratories that naturally produce a cocktail of _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ venom and hallucinogenic pheromones, as well as a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sticky|sticky]]_ saliva in which they trap their victims. Nearly blind, a _narrik_’s cluster of eyespots atop its body allows it to only detect light and movement, and the aberration hunts almost entirely by _scent_, especially savoring the heady aroma of terror.
