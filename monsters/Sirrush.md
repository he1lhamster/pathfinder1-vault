    rather than within the last round.
  Radiance (Su): A sirrush exudes sunlight, filling a radius of 120 feet around it
    with bright light, though looking directly at a sirrush does not cause blindness
    as would looking at the sun. This sunlight affects creatures such as certain undead
    and fungi as if it were real sunlight. A sirrush's radiance aura is suppressed

  Enlightened and wise, they show mercy to all but the most irredeemable of evil beings.
  Unlike many creatures of the dragon type, sirrushes have little interest in treasure
  and feel no compulsion to hoard.
