  Barrier (Su): Once per day as a swift action, a clockwork guardian can unfold its
    shield to form a metal barrier up to 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. This duplicates
    the effects of a wall of iron spell, save for the smaller size of the created
    wall. After using this ability, the clockwork guardian loses its shield bonus
    and shield bash attack, but it gains two slam attacks as primary attacks. The
    clockwork guardian's shield rebuilds itself automatically 24 hours after it uses
    this ability. Multiple clockwork guardians can work together to create a larger
    barrier, each new metal barrier merging seamlessly with an existing one. Once
    created, a clockwork guardian's barrier lasts for 24 hours before crumbling.
  Shield Expert (Su): A clockwork guardian carries a heavy shield that cannot be disarmed
    or sundered. Its programming grants it proficiency in the shield's use and Improved
    Shield Bash as a bonus feat. The clockwork guardian's shield bash deals damage
    as if it were one size category larger than normal (1d6 points for a Medium clockwork
    guardian).
