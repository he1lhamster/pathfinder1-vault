  Absorb Flesh (Ex): A coven ooze doesn't eat plants or inorganic matter, but devours
    living flesh with voracious speed, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain to
    creatures it engulfs. Whenever the ooze deals Constitution drain in this manner,
    it heals 10 hit points for each point of Constitution drained. Excess hit points
    above its normal maximum are gained as temporary hit points. A coven ooze can
    gain no more than 30 temporary hit points in this manner. If a coven ooze has
    temporary hit points when it splits, those temporary hit points are divided into
    its copies.
  Hag Eye Ray (Sp): 'Every 1d4 rounds, each of the hag eyes within a coven ooze can
    fire a magic ray at a target within 60 feet. Each hag eye emits a different spell
    effect: bestow curse (DC 17, -6 to Dexterity), confusion (DC 17, 9 rounds), hold
    person (DC 16, 9 rounds). All of these spell-like abilities function at CL 9th.
    The save DCs are Charisma-based, and include a +8 racial bonus.'
  Split (Ex): Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a coven ooze. Instead,
    the creature splits into three identical oozes, each with one third of the original
    ooze's current hit points (round down). Upon splitting, each copy retains a single
    hag eye within its mass and can continue to use its hag eye ray ability, albeit
    with only one spell effect. A coven ooze with 10 hit points or fewer, or that
    doesn't have enough hag eyes to result in each new ooze getting its own eye, cannot
    be split and instead takes damage normally.
desc_long: |-
  Coven oozes result from a hag eye ooze's conglomeration of multiple hag eyes, often caused by the destruction of a hag coven with a hag eye ooze nearby. With its controller gone, and no one to provide food, the ooze feeds upon its mistress and her coven sisters. Through this consumption, the creation gains some semblance of its creators' cunning, independent thought, and malignancy. If the coven sisters had hag eyes of their own, the ooze absorbs them into its form. Otherwise, consumption of the coven, with the residual magic of the original hag eye, transforms one eye from each of the hags in the coven into a functional hag eye. 

  A coven ooze wanders its creator's territory, devouring any living organism it comes upon. With their animal intelligence, they use the terrain to their best advantage, often lying in waterways near frequented river crossings. 

  Coven oozes are generally 10 feet to a side and weigh roughly 1,500 pounds, although larger specimens have been encountered. When a coven ooze comes across another creature with the ooze subtype, it attempts to engulf and consume it. For every 10 HD of ooze creatures that a coven ooze consumes, its size increases by one step, to a maximum size of Gargantuan. If a coven ooze ever consumes a hag eye ooze, the creator of the hag eye ooze-if a hag-must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or have her connection to the hag eye ooze severed.

This eerily disturbing gelatinous blob lumbers forward. Three
disembodied eyes float within its mass, seemingly scanning back

##### Description

Coven oozes result from a _[[monsters/Hag Eye Ooze|hag eye ooze]]_’s conglomeration
of multiple hag eyes, often caused by the _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ of a
hag coven with a _hag eye ooze_ nearby. With its controller
gone, and no one to provide food, the ooze feeds upon its
mistress and her coven sisters. Through this _[[feats/Consumption|consumption]]_,
the creation gains some semblance of its creators’ _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cunning|cunning]]_,
independent thought, and malignancy. If the coven sisters
had hag eyes of their own, the ooze absorbs them into its
form. Otherwise, _consumption_ of the coven, with the
residual magic of the original hag eye, transforms one eye
from each of the hags in the coven into a functional hag eye.

A coven ooze wanders its creator’s territory, devouring
any living organism it comes upon. With their animal
intelligence, they use the terrain to their best advantage,
often lying in waterways near frequented river crossings.

Coven oozes are generally 10 feet to a side and weigh
roughly 1,500 pounds, although larger specimens have
been encountered. When a coven ooze comes across another
creature with the ooze subtype, it attempts to _engulf_ and
consume it. For every 10 HD of ooze creatures that a coven
ooze consumes, its size increases by one step, to a maximum
size of Gargantuan. If a coven ooze ever consumes a hag
eye ooze, the creator of the _hag eye ooze_—if a hag—must
succeed at a DC 25 Will save or
have her connection to the
_hag eye ooze_ severed.
