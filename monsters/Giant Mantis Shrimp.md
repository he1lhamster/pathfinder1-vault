### Special Abilities

**Incredible Sight (Ex)** A _[[monsters/Giant Mantis Shrimp|giant mantis shrimp]]_’s eyes pick up

colors well beyond those visible to humans, and it can see

perfectly in all light conditions, including supernatural

_[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_. As long as the _giant mantis shrimp_ is not

_[[conditions/Blinded|blinded]]_, it is treated as having _[[universal monster rules/Blindsight|blindsight]]_ 60 feet.
**Sonic Burst (Ex)** A _giant mantis shrimp_ attacks with such

extreme speed that its pincers issue a concussive blast of

light and force when they snap closed. Each time a giant

mantis shrimp makes a pincer attack, whether it hits or

misses, each creature in a 10-foot-radius burst centered

on the attack’s target takes 1d8 points of sonic damage

and must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or be _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_ for

1 round. A creature that succeeds at this save is immune

to the stun effect from additional sonic bursts from that

_giant mantis shrimp_ until the vermin’s next turn, but it

still takes sonic damage from additional sonic bursts. The

_giant mantis shrimp_ is immune to this effect. The save DC is

Constitution-based.
**Speedy Pincers (Ex)** A _giant mantis shrimp_ can make

iterative attacks with one pincer.

##### Description

Though the colorful shells of _giant mantis shrimp_ are

beautiful to behold, the sight of one often means death.

These apex predators prowl tide pools and coastal shallows,

competing for territory with _[[monsters/Karkinoi|karkinoi]]_ and _[[monsters/Shark|shark]]_ eater crabs.

A typical _giant mantis shrimp_ grows to 4 feet high and

6 feet long, and weighs around 200 pounds.
