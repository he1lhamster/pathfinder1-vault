special_abilities:
  Dissonance (Su): Every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a dawn piper can use a musical
    instrument to unleash a deadly torrent of sonic vibrations that tears at the very
    physicality of its enemies. This is similar to a breath weapon that deals 6d6
    points of sonic damage in a 15-ft. cone (Reflex DC 16 half ). A dawn piper must
    be in possession of a musical instrument in order to use this ability. The save
    DC is Charisma-based.
  Elemental Font (Su): |-
    A dawn piper can infuse a 40-foot-radius area with the primal qualities of the First World. The creation of an elemental font requires a musical instrument and a musical ritual lasting 8 hours. As long as the piper returns to it every 24 hours, a font can persist forever, but it is destroyed immediately upon the creator's death. A dawn piper can also destroy its own font as a full-round action. The dawn piper gains additional spell-like abilities based on a single element while within range of its elemental font. Dimensional anchor and dimensional lock stop the flow of power, preventing the piper from using the additional spelllike abilities. The save DCs are Charisma-based, and the spell-like abilities are cast at caster level 7th. 

    Air: 2/day-fly, gust of wind (DC 15), shocking grasp 
    Earth: 2/day-grease (DC 14), spiked pitAPG (DC 16), stone callAPG 
    Fire: 2/day-burning hands (DC 14), fireball (DC 16), pyrotechnics (DC 15) 
    Water: 2/day-aqueous orbAPG (DC 16), hydraulic pushAPG, slipstreamAPG
  Terrible Beauty (Su): As a standard action, a dawn piper can surround itself in
    an intense aura of magnificence that is too potent for non-fey to withstand. Non-fey
    creatures within a 30-foot radius of the dawn piper must succeed at a DC 16 Will
    save or be blinded or deafened for 1d4 rounds (the piper's choice, but the effect
    is consistent for all affected creatures), and take 1 point of bleed damage from
    their eyes or ears (depending on the specific effect). This aura lasts 1 full
    round, and a creature that succeeds at its saving throw cannot be affected again
    for 24 hours. This is a visual or auditory, mind-affecting effect. A dawn piper
    requires a musical instrument in order to create this aura. The save DC for this
    ability is Charisma-based.
desc_long: Strange and enigmatic creatures from the First World, dawn pipers are unmistakably
  humanoid and share some of the same delicate features of half-elves. But dawn pipers'
  otherworldly nature becomes evident when one looks at the creatures' eyes, which
  burn with a strange light. Their skin is smooth, free of blemish or body hair, and
  radiant. Their hair moves constantly, like the flickering flames of a torch in the
  breeze, and seems to express a seasonal theme in coloration. Their faces are portraits
  of every emotion that passes through their consciousness; joy, loss, and murder
  may all dance across their expressions in a matter of moments. Only when a dawn
  piper is asleep or plays a soothing melody on its pipes does its expression become
  static and human-and through such songs, dawn pipers' heartbreaking beauty becomes
  truly evident.
