  Death Roll (Ex): When grappling a foe of its size or smaller, a crocodile can perform
    a death roll upon making a successful grapple check. As it clings to its foe,
    it tucks in its legs and rolls rapidly, twisting and wrenching its victim. The
    crocodile deals its bite damage and knocks the creature prone. If successful,
    the crocodile maintains its grapple.
  Sprint (Ex): Once per minute a crocodile may sprint, increasing its land speed to
    40 feet for 1 round.
desc_long: Crocodiles are depicted in many ways in ancient Osirion, but most often
  they are shown in association with the River Sphinx and, more importantly, with
  the god Sobek. Mummified crocodiles are common in crypts that are no farther from
  the river than a single day's walk. Many mummif ied crocodiles have baby crocodiles
  placed on their backs or in their mouths, representing how live crocodiles transport
  and care for their young.
