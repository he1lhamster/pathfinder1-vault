special_abilities:
  Petrification (Su): A mythic cockatrice's bite causes flesh to calcify and harden-multiple
    bites can cause a living creature to fossilize into stone. Each time a creature
    is damaged by a mythic cockatrice's bite attack, it must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude
    save or take 1d6 points of Dexterity damage as its flesh and bones stiffen and
    harden. If a creature's Dexterity score is reduced to 0 by a cockatrice's bite,
    that creature immediately turns completely to stone, as if petrified by a flesh
    to stone spell. Every day, a creature petrified by a cockatrice in this manner
    can attempt a new DC 12 Fortitude save; if it succeeds, the victim recovers from
    the petrification with a Dexterity score of 1 (and thereafter can be restored
    to full Dexterity by natural healing or magic as normal). If a petrified creature
    fails three of these Fortitude saves in a row, the petrified state becomes permanent.
    A creature restored to flesh via magic has any Dexterity damage caused by cockatrice
    bites removed, but not any existing Dexterity damage from other sources. A cockatrice
    is immune to the petrification ability of itself and of other cockatrices, but
    other petrification attacks affect them normally. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Petrification Aura (Su): A creature within 30 feet of a mythic cockatrice on its
    turn must successfully save or be subjected by petrification as if it had been
    bitten.
  Stone Plumage (Su): Any weapon that strikes a mythic cockatrice takes 1d6 points
    of damage that bypasses the weapon's hardness. Any creature attacking the cockatrice
    with natural weapons or unarmed strikes takes 1d6 points of damage.
desc_long: A mythic cockatrice is infused with stone, perhaps because of some aspect
  of its aging process, or its body has absorbed minerals from countless stony foes,
  or its incessant grooming has slowly petrified its own flesh. Even more aggressive
  and territorial than non-mythic kin, a mythic cockatrice recklessly attacks anything
  that intrudes on its territory.

### Special Abilities

**Petrification (Su)** A _[[monsters/Cockatrice|cockatrice]]_’s bite causes flesh to calcify and harden—multiple bites can cause a living creature to fossilize into stone. Each time a creature is damaged by a _cockatrice_’s bite attack, it must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Dexterity damage as its flesh and bones stiffen and harden. (This _[[spells/Slow|slow]]_ petrification does not alter a bitten creature’s natural armor.) A creature that is reduced to 0 Dexterity by a _cockatrice_’s bites immediately turns completely to stone, as if _[[conditions/Petrified|petrified]]_ by a _[[spells/Flesh to Stone|flesh to stone]]_ spell. Every day, a creature _petrified_ by a _cockatrice_ in this manner can attempt a new DC 12 Fortitude save to recover from the petrification, at which point the victim returns to flesh with 1 Dexterity (and thereafter can be restored to full Dexterity by natural healing or magic as normal)—but after a _petrified_ creature fails three of these Fortitude saves in a row, the _petrified_ state becomes permanent. A creature restored to flesh via magic has its Dexterity damage caused by _cockatrice_ bites removed, but not any existing Dexterity damage from other sources. A _cockatrice_ is immune to the petrification ability of itself and of other cockatrices, but other petrification attacks affect them normally. The save DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

Stupid, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_, and repulsive, cockatrices are avoided by other creatures due to their magical ability to turn _flesh to stone_. Legends say that the first _cockatrice_ emerged from an egg laid by a cockerel and incubated by a toad. Whether or not the story is true, today’s cockatrices breed true in terrifying and filthy dens haphazardly excavated by as many as a dozen of the squawking creatures. Males greatly outnumber females in these flocks, and are distinguished only by their wattles and combs. The typical _cockatrice_ stands just over 2 feet high and weighs 5 pounds.

While their diet consists primarily of seeds and _petrified_ insects (which conveniently double in the creature’s gizzard as both gastroliths and nutrition as they grind away), cockatrices fiercely defend their territories from anything they deem a threat, and the wanderings of _[[classes/Rogue|rogue]]_ males seeking new spots to build dens sometimes bring them into unintentional contact with humanoids, with devastating results.

The _cockatrice_’s strange ability to turn other creatures to stone is the creature’s greatest defense, and a _cockatrice_ lair is invariably littered with _petrified_ remnants of foes. In an ironic twist of fate, however, weasels and ferrets—the creatures most likely to slip into cockatrices’ nests and consume their eggs—appear to be completely immune to the effect. For _[[monsters/Unknown|unknown]]_ reasons, cockatrices are both terrified of and enraged by conventional roosters, and are equally likely to flee or attack when confronted by one.
