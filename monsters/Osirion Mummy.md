  stares fixedly at its prey.

# Osirion Mummy
A low moan escapes from this desiccated husk as it shambles forward. Its flesh, such as it is, is barely visible beneath layers of ancient funerary wrapping, which are themselves covered in arcane symbols and hieroglyphics. It moves with a single-minded _[[universal monster rules/Ferocity|ferocity]]_ that belies its withered appearance, and its one good eye stares fixedly at its prey.

##### Description

The mummification process of ancient Osirion results in a variant _[[monsters/Mummy|mummy]]_. Although the _Osirion mummy_ appears very similar to normal mummies-a desiccated husklike creature, draped in embalming wrap adorned with hieroglyphics-the _Osirion mummy_ differs slightly in ability. Osirion mummies do not spread the curse of _[[curses/Mummy rot|mummy rot]]_ through touch, nor does the very sight of them give rise to _[[universal monster rules/Paralysis|paralysis]]_. They are still, however, resilient killing machines.
