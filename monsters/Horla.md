  Command Somnambulist (Su): Once per day when a horla controls a sleeping creature
    via dominate person, it can cause the creature to wake and obey it for a number
    of hours equal to the horla's Charisma modifier (4 hours for the typical horla).
    If the creature is allowed to return to sleep before this duration expires, it
    retains no memories of any of the activities it performed during that time.
  Ennui (Su): Once per day as a standard action, a horla can target a sleeping creature
    within 30 feet with an insidious curse. The target can resist the ennui with a
    successful DC 19 Will save, but regardless of the result of the save, the target
    is not aware that it has been targeted by this subtle effect. If the victim fails
    this save, it takes a -2 penalty on ability checks, saving throws, and skill checks
    for 24 hours. This penalty is doubled to -4 on saving throws against fear effects
    and for concentration checks. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save
    DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  Horlas are native to the Ethereal Plane. Although they have no inborn ability to traverse the boundaries between planes, all horlas seek ways to slip onto the Material Plane so they can feed on the hopes and dreams of humanoids. Once on the Material Plane, a horla selects a favored host to plague while remaining invisible, gaining nourishment by consuming hope and leaving the host wracked with ennui. The horla slowly drives its host mad by forcing him into increasingly destructive acts, yet it is always careful to issue its commands so that the repercussions are what cause lasting harm to a victim's social life or relationships rather than the specific acts. 

  When not invisible, a horla appears as spherical mass with several tentacles. A typical horla weighs 40 pounds.

##### Description

Horlas are native to the Ethereal Plane. Although they have no inborn ability to traverse the boundaries between planes, all horlas seek ways to slip onto the Material Plane so they can feed on the hopes and dreams of humanoids. Once on the Material Plane, a _horla_ selects a favored host to plague while remaining _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_, gaining nourishment by consuming hope and leaving the host wracked with ennui. The _horla_ slowly drives its host mad by forcing him into increasingly destructive acts, yet it is always careful to issue its commands so that the repercussions are what cause lasting _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ to a victim’s social life or relationships rather than the specific acts.

When not _invisible_, a _horla_ appears as spherical mass with several tentacles. A typical _horla_ weighs 40 pounds.
