  Blood Frenzy (Ex): Once per day, a malenti that takes damage in combat can fly into
    a frenzy in the following round. It gains a +2 bonus to its Constitution and Strength,
    but takes a -2 penalty to its AC. The frenzy lasts as long as the battle or 1
    minute, whichever is shorter.
  Speak with Sharks (Su): A malenti can communicate telepathically with sharks to
    a distance of 150 feet. This communication is limited to simple concepts, such
    as “come here,” “defend me,” or “attack this target.”
desc_long: The unpredictability and viciousness of the sahuagin race isn't just an
  aspect of their sharklike temperament- it seems to be inherent in their very beings.
  The unusual and typically deadly mutants common to the race attest to this, their
  forms altering and becoming more deadly based either on the needs of the community
  or ambiguous environmental factors. Whatever the case, sahuagin mutants often rise
  to positions of respect and inf luence in sahuagin communities, their innate advantages
  instantly placing them among their people's rulers. Of these mutants, four-armed
  sahuagin brutes and malenti- sahuagin with the appearances of sea elves-arise most
  commonly, though these are in no way the only sahuagin mutants known to the savage
  seas.

##### Description

The unpredictability and viciousness of the _sahuagin_ race isn’t just an aspect of their sharklike temperament— it seems to be inherent in their very beings. The unusual and typically _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ mutants common to the race attest to this, their forms altering and becoming more _deadly_ based either on the needs of the community or ambiguous environmental factors. Whatever the case, _sahuagin_ mutants often rise to positions of respect and inf luence in _sahuagin_ communities, their innate advantages instantly placing them among their people’s rulers. Of these mutants, four-armed _sahuagin_ brutes and malenti— _sahuagin_ with the appearances of sea elves—arise most commonly, though these are in no way the only _sahuagin_ mutants known to the savage seas.
