    an almiraj is increased by 50%.
  Magic Horn (Su): While on the creature's head, an almiraj's horn is treated as a
    +1 weapon. Any living creature slain by an almiraj's gore attack immediately turns
    to stone (as if by the flesh to stone spell, with no saving throw, and the creature
    is still dead). A severed almiraj horn retains a wisp of its former magic, and
    counts as a masterwork weapon if used to create a magical dagger or similar small
    piercing weapon.
desc_long: |-
  The almiraj is a surprisingly dangerous predator. Almirajes' strong affinity with witches, magical gore attacks, and susceptibility to hexes suggest they have arcane origins, perhaps the result of experiments by witches seeking to deliberately create a new kind of familiar.

  Reminiscent of a unicorn horn, an almiraj's most prominent feature serves as both a deterrent and deadly weapon. The almiraj uses its horn to hunt, stalking and spearing prey on the brutal appendage. The horn's unique magical properties have the gruesome side effect of forcing the almiraj to consume its prey while it still lives, before it turns to stone- when hunting smaller creatures, the almiraj strikes to slow its prey through blood loss and to disable it by maiming its limbs. Occasionally, an enterprising individual will hunt an almiraj for its horn, but success is limited since almirajes are exceptionally vicious, stealthy, and athletic targets- their acrobatic leaps bring their horns within reach of the vital organs of much larger creatures.

  Almirajes are fiercely territorial, although they flee if unable to fight on their terms, only to return later to defend their territory. They demonstrate their territorial claims to others of their kind with acrobatic displays and mock horn battles rather than fighting in earnest. Other intruders are met with aggressive posturing and warning calls, though almirajes prefer not to fight. If an interloper refuses to withdraw, however, the almiraj will fight to the death to defend its claim.

  It's unclear how almirajes reproduce, since females are rare and the creatures are always encountered alone. Records indicate that they live for 40 to 60 years and some communities are able to build respectful, if wary, relationships with them.

  Almirajes are particularly popular with witches as familiars. Spellcasters of any alignment with the Improved Familiar feat can gain an almiraj as a familiar at 5th level.

**Magic Horn (Su)** While on the creature’s head, an _almiraj_’s horn is treated as a +1 weapon. Any living creature slain by an _almiraj_’s gore attack immediately turns to stone (as if by the _[[spells/Flesh to Stone|flesh to stone]]_ spell, with no saving throw, and the creature is still dead).

##### Description

The _almiraj_ is a surprisingly dangerous predator. Almirajes’ strong affinity with witches, magical gore attacks, and susceptibility to hexes suggest they have arcane origins, perhaps the result of experiments by witches seeking to deliberately create a new kind of familiar.

Reminiscent of a _[[monsters/Unicorn|unicorn]]_ horn, an _almiraj_’s most prominent feature serves as both a deterrent and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ weapon. The _almiraj_ uses its horn to hunt, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Stalking|stalking]]_ and spearing prey on the brutal appendage. The horn’s unique magical properties have the gruesome side effect of forcing the _almiraj_ to consume its prey while it still lives, before it turns to stone— when hunting smaller creatures, the _almiraj_ strikes to _[[spells/Slow|slow]]_ its prey through blood loss and to disable it by maiming its limbs. Occasionally, an enterprising individual will hunt an _almiraj_ for its horn, but success is limited since almirajes are exceptionally _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_, _[[feats/Stealthy|stealthy]]_, and _[[feats/Athletic|athletic]]_ targets— their _[[feats/Acrobatic|acrobatic]]_ leaps bring their horns within reach of the vital organs of much larger creatures.

Almirajes are fiercely territorial, although they flee if unable to _[[feats/Fight On|fight on]]_ their terms, only to return later to defend their territory. They demonstrate their territorial claims to others of their kind with _acrobatic_ displays and mock horn battles rather than fighting in earnest. Other intruders are met with aggressive posturing and warning calls, though almirajes prefer not to fight. If an interloper refuses to withdraw, however, the _almiraj_ will fight to the death to defend its claim.

It’s unclear how almirajes reproduce, since females are rare and the creatures are always encountered alone. Records indicate that they live for 40 to 60 years and some communities are able to build respectful, if wary, relationships with them.

Almirajes are particularly popular with witches as familiars. Spellcasters of any alignment with the _[[feats/Improved Familiar|Improved Familiar]]_ feat can gain an _almiraj_ as a familiar at 5th level.
