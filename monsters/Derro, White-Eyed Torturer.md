##### Description

The self-mutilated white-eyed torturer carves into humanoid flesh with deviant glee and bestial hands, eager to learn the limits of anatomy. Armed with cutting implements, pliers, clamps, and perhaps even aberrant claws, this twisted surgeon goes about his work modifying his patients and himself. To this _derro_, his subject is at best a beast, and as his victim’s screams _[[spells/Echo|echo]]_ through the nearby fungus-lined tunnels, other derros become drawn to the song and wait eagerly outside the torturer’s laboratory to see what wonder he has created.
