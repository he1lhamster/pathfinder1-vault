  Aura of Breathlessness (Su): The agonized gasping of an immured displaces oxygen
    within 10 feet of it, automatically extinguishing nonmagical fires within this
    range. Breathing creatures within the aura must hold their breath or risk suffocation.
    Whenever an immured deals nonlethal damage to a creature holding its breath in
    the aura, the duration the target can hold its breath for decreases by a number
    of rounds equal to the nonlethal damage dealt. The immured cannot dismiss this
    aura.
  Bound (Su): Immured are bound to the locations in which they died. Each hour an
    immured remains away from the tomb or building in which it died, it takes 1d6
    points of damage that can't be healed until it returns to its place of death.
  Breach (Su): As a swift action, an immured can touch a nonmagical wall and open
    a spatial rift. The touched 5-foot section of wall (which can be up to 2 feet
    thick) effectively ceases to exist for 2 rounds, except for a dark, semisolid
    membrane that blocks line of sight through the rift. The immured can see, move,
    attack, or even drag a target through the rift without penalty. Other creatures
    can move through the rift, treating it as difficult terrain. After 2 rounds, the
    rift closes, pushing anything inside it into the nearest open space.
  Seize (Ex): An immured can choose to deal nonlethal damage with its slam attack
    with no penalty on the attack roll. In addition, an immured that deals nonlethal
    damage with its slam attack can attempt a drag combat maneuver against the target
    as a free action.
desc_long: |-
  Immured are undead remains of those who died of slow suffocation in a confined, lightless space. Their feelings of abject terror and desperate desire to escape before death manifest as an ability to open temporary rifts in reality. Although they loathe the bright lights and open spaces of the world outside, they occasionally emerge to violently hush any sounds that disturb their repose. Some immured find the last gasps of dying creatures intoxicating, so they seek out victims to choke night after night.

  While an accidental live burial can trigger the birth of an immured, most of these unfortunates are brought about by purposeful malevolence, such as being walled in as a form of torture or execution in life. In cultures obsessed with undeath or the afterlife, living servants are sometimes honored by being entombed with their masters, which can create immured.

  An immured is 6 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**Aura of Breathlessness (Su)** The agonized gasping of an _[[monsters/Immured|immured]]_ displaces oxygen within 10 feet of it, automatically extinguishing nonmagical fires within this range. Breathing creatures within the aura must hold their breath or risk _[[spells/Suffocation|suffocation]]_. Whenever an _immured_ deals nonlethal damage to a creature holding its breath in the aura, the duration the target can hold its breath for decreases by a number of rounds equal to the nonlethal damage dealt. The _immured_ cannot dismiss this aura.

**Bound (Su)** _Immured_ are bound to the locations in which they died. Each hour an _immured_ remains away from the tomb or building in which it died, it takes 1d6 points of damage that can’t be healed until it returns to its place of death.

**Breach (Su)** As a swift action, an _immured_ can touch a nonmagical wall and open a spatial rift. The touched 5-foot section of wall (which can be up to 2 feet thick) effectively ceases to exist for 2 rounds, except for a dark, semisolid membrane that blocks line of sight through the rift. The _immured_ can see, move, attack, or even drag a target through the rift without penalty. Other creatures can move through the rift, treating it as difficult terrain. After 2 rounds, the rift closes, pushing anything inside it into the nearest open space.
**Seize (Ex)** An _immured_ can choose to deal nonlethal damage with its slam attack with no penalty on the attack roll. In addition, an _immured_ that deals nonlethal damage with its slam attack can attempt a drag combat maneuver against the target as a free action.

##### Description

_Immured_ are undead remains of those who died of _[[spells/Slow|slow]]_ _suffocation_ in a confined, lightless space. Their feelings of abject terror and desperate desire to escape before death manifest as an ability to open temporary rifts in reality. Although they loathe the bright lights and open spaces of the world outside, they occasionally emerge to violently hush any sounds that disturb their repose. Some _immured_ find the last gasps of _[[conditions/Dying|dying]]_ creatures intoxicating, so they seek out victims to choke night after night.

While an accidental live burial can trigger the birth of an _immured_, most of these unfortunates are brought about by purposeful malevolence, such as being walled in as a form of torture or execution in life. In cultures obsessed with undeath or the afterlife, living servants are sometimes honored by being entombed with their masters, which can create _immured_.

An _immured_ is 6 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.
