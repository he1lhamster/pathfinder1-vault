  A race that was old when the world was young, titans are very near to the divine. This nearness inspired bitterness in the hearts of the mightiest titans, and when they grew jealous of the adulation the gods received from mortals, they began a crusade to destroy mortal life. As this war began, the Elysian titans turned against their kin and, by sacrificing some of their power to the gods, convinced the deities to banish their arrogant kin to the Abyss.

  Lone Elysian titans often wander the planes, seeking enlightenment or exploring ancient places of power. Others still have the crusading impulse of the ancient war and can be found manipulating events from behind the scenes, training aspiring heroes, counseling kings, marshaling armies to overthrow tyranny, and inspiring mortals to become legends. A titan does not age-unless slain by violence, a titan is immortal.

  One in every dozen Elysian titans is a prophet-a titan who manifests the goodwill of the gods and possesses the spellcasting power of a 20th-level cleric. These titans do not gain access to domains or any other cleric class abilities. They are CR 22 creatures.

  Elysian titans are 70 feet tall and weigh 20 tons.

##### Description

A race that was old when the world was young, titans are very near to the divine. This nearness _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Inspired|inspired]]_ bitterness in the hearts of the mightiest titans, and when they grew jealous of the adulation the gods received from mortals, they began a crusade to destroy mortal life. As this war began, the Elysian titans turned against their kin and, by sacrificing some of their power to the gods, convinced the deities to banish their arrogant kin to the Abyss.

Lone Elysian titans often wander the planes, seeking enlightenment or exploring ancient places of power. Others still have the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Crusading|crusading]]_ impulse of the ancient war and can be found manipulating events from behind the scenes, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ aspiring heroes, counseling kings, marshaling armies to overthrow tyranny, and inspiring mortals to become legends. A titan does not age—unless slain by violence, a titan is immortal.

One in every dozen Elysian titans is a _[[feats/Prophet|prophet]]_—a titan who manifests the goodwill of the gods and possesses the spellcasting power of a 20th-level _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_. These titans do not gain access to domains or any other _cleric_ class abilities. They are CR 22 creatures.

Elysian titans are 70 feet tall and weigh 20 tons.
