    damage each round. A giant leech has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple
    on a foe once it is attached. An attached giant leech can be struck with a weapon
    or grappled itself-if its prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape Artist
    check against it, the giant leech is removed.
  Blood Drain (Ex): A giant leech drains blood at the end of each turn it is attached,
    inflicting 1 point of Strength and Constitution damage.
  Susceptible to Salt (Ex): A handful of salt burns a giant leech as if it were a
    flask of acid, causing 1d6 points of damage per use.
desc_long: These invertebrate parasitic relatives of the worm lurk in stagnant or
  slow-moving water, waiting for a suitable host.
