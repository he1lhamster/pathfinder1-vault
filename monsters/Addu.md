    save DC is Constitution-based.
  Rip Current (Su): An addu can stir the water in such a way that it creates powerful
    currents in its immediate area. As a move action, an addu can either push creatures
    and objects up to 30 feet away from it or draw creatures and objects within 30
    feet toward it. Creatures and objects caught in the rip current can resist being
    moved with a successful DC 25 Reflex save. This ability can only be used in the
    water, and the save DC is Constitution-based.

  The colors of the tropical deep-simmering reds, yellows, and oranges-decorate addus' long, serpentine bodies. In addition to the ominous fins on their backs, smaller spines jut from addus' snouts, heads, and necks. Their short but powerful forearms can strip flesh from bone, especially when the beasts employ them alongside their barge-sized jaws, which bear teeth the length of daggers. With long tails that can sweep from the water with whiplike velocity, addus can reach up to 50 feet long and weigh up to 14,000 pounds.

##### Description

As enigmatic as they are dangerous, addus hail from the most hellish corners of Golarion’s deepest seas. _Addu_ encounters are thankfully rare, but those who have faced one and survived tell tales of the beasts’ unimaginable powers. As a result, merchant and pirate lookouts alike carefully watch the watery horizons for jagged, fiery-hued spines, which have come to signal seafarers’ imminent _[[spells/Doom|doom]]_.

The colors of the tropical deep—simmering reds, yellows, and oranges—decorate addus’ long, serpentine bodies. In addition to the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Ominous|ominous]]_ fins on their backs, smaller spines jut from addus’ snouts, heads, and necks. Their short but powerful forearms can strip flesh from bone, especially when the beasts employ them alongside their barge-sized jaws, which bear teeth the length of daggers. With long tails that can sweep from the water with whiplike velocity, addus can reach up to 50 feet long and weigh up to 14,000 pounds.
