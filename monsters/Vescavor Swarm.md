# Vescavor Swarm
With a gibbering chorus, hundreds of toothy insects swarm together,

their heads nothing more than maws filled with a sickly green glow.

### Special Abilities

**Gibber (Su)** Vescavors yammer the endless chorus of the Abyss.

Any creature within 15 feet of a _[[monsters/Vescavor Swarm|vescavor swarm]]_ or inside

it must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be _[[conditions/Confused|confused]]_ for 1

round. This is a mind-affecting sonic compulsion. A creature

that saves cannot be affected by the same _vescavor swarm_’s

gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**_Ravenous_ (Ex)** Vescavors can devour nearly anything. If

the swarm attacks an object or structure, the vescavors

ignore its hardness if it is made of any substance other

than adamantine. Additionally, every round that a creature

is in the same space as the swarm, the vescavors begin

devouring one object on the creature—if the vescavor

swarm is not under the control of a _[[monsters/Vescavor Queen|vescavor queen]]_, refer to

Pathfinder Core Rulebook 216 Table 9–2. Once the vescavors

choose an item in this way, they continue to devour that

same item until it is destroyed. The object takes half its

maximum hit points in damage and gains the _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_

condition. If the vescavors attack an object with the _broken_

condition, it is destroyed. An attended or magic object can

make a DC 15 Reflex save to negate this effect. The save DC

is Constitution-based.

**Traumatizing (Su)** Enduring the presence of a _vescavor swarm_

is akin to being trapped in the Abyss itself. Any creature

that spends more than 3 consecutive rounds inside a

_vescavor swarm_ must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or gain

one of the types of madness presented on page 250 of the

Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide. Roll on the Types of

_[[spells/Insanity|Insanity]]_ table to determine which type of _insanity_ affects

the creature. Despite each entry listing a DC, the creature

does not receive an additional Will save to prevent the

_insanity_. This affliction is permanent, but can be healed as

detailed in the Curing _Insanity_ section of the Sanity and

Madness rules. The save DC is Charisma-based.

##### Description

Once found only in the lightless crevices and shrieking

half-live jungles of the Abyss, the yammering, gluttonous

vermin of the Abyss _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ vescavors crawl through

portals into the Material Plane to feed and spawn. Ruled

by enormous, hideous queens who direct their swarms

in finding food and destroying foes with the help of

pheromones and mental commands, vescavor swarms

devour objects, creatures, and structures alike. Their

hunger is insatiable and carries with it the terrors of the

Abyss itself, warping the minds of even those creatures

who escape the vescavors’ maws. Only adamantine can

endure their gnashing teeth, and a swarm of vescavors

that descends upon a settlement devours everything and

leaves nothing behind.
