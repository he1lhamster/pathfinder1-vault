  Berserk (Ex): When a mythic flesh golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1%
    chance each round that the golem goes berserk. A berserk golem attacks the nearest
    living creature or smashes some object smaller than itself if no creature is within
    reach, then moves on to spread more destruction. If the golem's creator is within
    60 feet and succeeds at a DC 20 Charisma check, she regains control of the golem
    by speaking firmly and persuasively to it. If the golem is inactive for 1 minute,
    its berserk chance resets to 0%.
  Immunity to Magic (Ex): A mythic flesh golem is immune to any spell or spell-like
    ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects
    function differently against the creature, as noted below. A mythic magical attack
    that deals cold or fire damage slows a mythic flesh golem (as the slow spell)
    for 2d6 rounds (no save).A magical attack that deals electricity damage (other
    than the golem's own sparking slam) ends any slow effect on the golem and heals
    1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal;
    (the golem gets no save against these attacks). If the amount of healing would
    cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary
    hit points.
  Mythic Brawler (Ex): The mythic flesh golem can spend a use of its mythic power
    to attempt a combat maneuver as a swift action with no attack of opportunity for
    the attempt.
  Sparking Slams (Su): If a mythic flesh golem strikes an opponent twice in 1 round
    with its slams, that creature takes an additional 2d10 points of electricity damage.
    A flesh golem cannot use its electricity attacks to deal electricity damage to
    itself.
desc_long: A mythic flesh golem retains an unnatural level of electrical energy from
  the process that created it. This grants it limited intelligence, extra strength,
  and the ability to shock its opponents.

### Special Abilities

**Berserk (Ex)** When a flesh golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that its elemental spirit breaks free and the golem goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Smashing|smashing]]_ some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then moving on to spread more _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_. The golem’s creator, if within 60 feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly and persuasively to the golem, which requires a DC 19 Charisma check. It takes 1 minute of inactivity by the golem to reset the golem’s berserk chance to 0%.

**_[[universal monster rules/Immunity|Immunity]]_ to Magic (Ex)** A flesh golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.

* A magical attack that deals cold or fire damage slows a flesh golem (as the _[[spells/Slow|slow]]_ spell) for 2d6 rounds (no save).
* A magical attack that deals electricity damage breaks any _slow_ effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A flesh golem gets no saving throw against attacks that deal electricity damage.

##### Description

A flesh golem is a ghoulish collection of stolen humanoid body parts, stitched together into a single composite form. Its cadaverous flesh has a sickly green or yellowish tint. A flesh golem wears whatever clothing its creator desires, usually just a ragged pair of trousers. It has no possessions and no weapons. A flesh golem stands 8 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds.

A flesh golem cannot speak, although it can emit a hoarse roar of sorts. It walks and moves with a stiff-jointed gait, as if not in complete control of its body.

Although most flesh golems are mindless, there are persistent rumors of unusual golems who somehow retain the memories of a previous life. The head (and thus brain) of such flesh golems must be just the right combination of fresh and (in its previous life) strong-willed, and even then luck and chance during the golem’s creation seem just as important in retaining the creature’s mind. Certainly most who construct flesh golems prefer mindless slaves over free-willed creations, and as a result intelligent flesh golems are rare indeed.
