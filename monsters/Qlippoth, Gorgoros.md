### Special Abilities

**Feast of Stone (Su)** As a standard action, a gorgoros can devour a Large or smaller _[[conditions/Petrified|petrified]]_ creature. When it consumes a creature this way, it regains 4d8+8 hit points and it gains hardness 8 for 1 minute. A _petrified_ creature is slain by this effect.

**_Gaze_ (Su)** A gorgoros’s _gaze_ turns creatures to stone permanently (Fortitude DC 20 negates) and has a range of 30 feet. The gorgoros can make a _gaze_ attack against a _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ creature as a swift action. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Horrific Appearance (Su)** Creatures that succumb to a gorgoros’s horrific appearance find their eyes drawn to the creature’s _gaze_ and must immediately attempt a saving throw against its _gaze_ attack. Affected creatures can’t avert or close their eyes, and treat creatures other than the gorgoros as having concealment.

**Writhing Tails (Ex)** A gorgoros’s tails coil around any creature that draws near. All squares adjacent to a gorgoros are considered difficult terrain. At the beginning of its turn, the gorgoros’s tails can attempt a grapple combat maneuver check against each adjacent creature as a free action. On a successful check, its tails deal 1d6+6 points of damage and the foe is _grappled_, but the gorgoros is not considered _grappled_. The tails gain a +5 bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks against foes they’re already grappling. Each time the tails succeed at such a check, they deal 1d6+6 points of damage but can’t pin foes. If the gorgoros moves, all _grappled_ creatures automatically move with it, but it can’t take creatures along when earth gliding.

##### Description

The gorgoros delights in petrifying living creatures to serve as material for twisted artistic endeavors. These fiends emerge from walls to petrify and devour, and use their stone-altering magic to reshape battlefields—or _petrified_ foes. Their grotesque art, made from resculpted victims, is short-lived; while gorgoroses don’t require sustenance, they enjoy feeding on the statues they create. Even those who avoid petrification may not escape unscathed; it is rumored that the daughters of survivors are born with petrifying gazes and serpents for hair. Blasphemous whispers hint that this is how medusas originated.

A gorgoros measures a full 15 feet in length and weighs 6,000 pounds.
