  The gorthek is, without a doubt, one of the crankiest beasts found roaming in the wilderness. Appearing as a strange combination of primeval bison and ornery rhinoceros, but with a leonine head crowned with ramlike horns, a gorthek is both immensely powerful and preternaturally hard to injure. Its thick, battering-ram head and powerful body make it a fearsome opponent, particularly when it's riled up and in full charge.

   Gortheks tend to travel in small herds, grazing across remote temperate grasslands or sparsely wooded hills. When a gorthek perceives a threat-which to the gorthek includes just about everything, often even other gortheks-it launches itself into a full charge, intent on sending the enemy flying.

   Orc tribes have made a practice of raising the beasts from infancy to serve as living siege engines during warfare. Future gorthek riders bond with the creatures from a very young age, and if possible use gorthek masks to make that bond stronger. When riding into battle, one orc sits astride the gorthek in a specially crafted saddle secured behind its massive horns and guides the beast using spiked reins.

   An adult male gorthek stands about 7 feet high at the shoulder and weighs around 9,000 pounds.

##### Description

The gorthek is, without a doubt, one of the crankiest beasts found roaming in the wilderness. Appearing as a strange combination of primeval bison and ornery _[[monsters/Rhinoceros|rhinoceros]]_, but with a leonine head crowned with ramlike horns, a gorthek is both immensely powerful and preternaturally hard to injure. Its thick, battering-ram head and powerful body make it a fearsome opponent, particularly when it’s riled up and in full charge.

Gortheks tend to travel in small herds, grazing across remote temperate grasslands or sparsely wooded hills. When a gorthek perceives a threat—which to the gorthek includes just about everything, often even other gortheks—it launches itself into a full charge, intent on _[[spells/Sending|sending]]_ the enemy flying.

_[[monsters/Orc|Orc]]_ tribes have made a practice of raising the beasts from infancy to serve as living siege engines during warfare. Future gorthek riders bond with the creatures from a very young age, and if possible use _[[items/Wondrous Item/Gorthek Masks|gorthek masks]]_ to make that bond stronger. When riding into battle, one _orc_ sits astride the gorthek in a specially crafted saddle secured behind its massive horns and guides the beast using spiked reins.

An adult male gorthek stands about 7 feet high at the shoulder and weighs around 9,000 pounds.
