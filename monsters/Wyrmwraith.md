##### Ecology

### Special Abilities

**Create Spawn (Su)** Any humanoids slain by a _[[monsters/Wyrmwraith|wyrmwraith]]_

become dread wraiths in 1d4

rounds. Spawn are under the _[[spells/Command|command]]_ of the _wyrmwraith_

that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at

which point they become free-willed dread wraiths. They

don’t possess any of the abilities they had in life.

**Divine _Dispelling_ (Su)** When a _wyrmwraith_ strikes a creature

with one of its claws, that creature is also affected by a targeted

greater _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ (CL 20th) that can dispel only divine spells.

**Ectoplasmic Shift (Su)** A _wyrmwraith_ can push through the

ectoplasmic _[[spells/Veil|veil]]_ to temporarily assume a physical form made

of ectoplasm. As a swift action, the _wyrmwraith_ can become

corporeal for 1d4 rounds. It can return to its _incorporeal_

form as a free action. Once its ectoplasmic form’s duration

ends, the _wyrmwraith_ can’t assume that form again for 1d4

rounds. While in ectoplasmic form, the _wyrmwraith_ loses the

_incorporeal_ ability (including its _deflection_ bonus to AC) and

gains a +16 natural armor bonus to AC, DR 15/—, a Strength

score equal to its Dexterity score, and the phase lurch ability.

The AC for a typical _wyrmwraith_ in ectoplasmic form is 41.

When in ectoplasmic form, its attacks are **Melee** bite +27

(4d6+18 plus _energy drain_), 2 claws +27 (2d8+12 plus divine

_dispelling_), 2 wings +24 (2d6+6), tail slap +24 (2d8+18).

**Phase Lurch (Su)** A _wyrmwraith_ in ectoplasmic form can

pass through walls or material obstacles. It must begin and

end its turn outside whatever wall or obstacle it’s moving

through. It can’t move through corporeal creatures with this

ability, and its movement speed is halved while moving

through a wall or obstacle. Any surface it moves through is

coated with a thin, silvery mucus that lingers for 1 minute.

**Positive Energy Transference (Su)** Whenever a _wyrmwraith_

succeeds at a saving throw to resist positive energy damage

but still suffers damage, the _wyrmwraith_ can immediately

transfer that damage to any dread _[[monsters/Wraith|wraith]]_ spawn of its

choice with 120 feet that it controls. The _wyrmwraith_ takes

any excess damage beyond the spawn’s hit points. Even if

the _wyrmwraith_ has no spawn under its control, when it

succeeds at its save against a positive energy effect that

normally deals half damage on a successful save, it instead

takes one quarter damage.

##### Description

Wyrmwraiths arise from the souls of powerful dragons

who refuse to accept death or have an irrational _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ of

moving on to an afterlife. No longer concerned with

amassing wealth and power, wyrmwraiths instead brood

with an unrelenting hatred of all living things. They hate

other dragons above all else, seeing the existence of those

living creatures as a mockery of their own.

Wyrmwraiths typically haunt their former lairs or some

other location where they can hide from the sunlight. They

are drawn toward ancient ruins, forgotten catacombs, and

other places associated with death. Litter, detritus and

bones lie heaped in areas controlled by a _wyrmwraith_

instead of the coins and gems. In the rare instances when a

_wyrmwraith_ is away from its den, the malice of its presence

still lingers palpably in the cold air. Still displaying the

draconic instinct to protect their homes from would-be

thieves, wyrmwraiths will often create and leave behind

undead guardians.

Wyrmwraiths slay those who venture near their

lairs, surrounding themselves with their newly created

dread wraiths and any other undead they can create or

control, carving out small fiefdoms populated by undead

servitors. They send their minions to collect anything

and anyone with knowledge or power they believe can

aid them in their dark endeavors. Captured individuals

who please the _wyrmwraith_ can expect to be reborn as

powerful undead while those that fail wallow in eternal

torment as dread wraiths.

On rare occasions throughout history, powerful

necromancers or dark cults have managed to entice or

coerce a _wyrmwraith_ into an alliance. These collaborations

are f leeting, as wyrmwraiths still retain a

twisted _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|shadow]]_ of their draconic pride,

seeing all other creatures as beneath

them. Unless compelled to work

with others, a _wyrmwraith_ turns

on its allies once they are no longer

useful to it.

Finding a way to gain a _wyrmwraith_’s

attention is difficult because it is no longer

interested in wealth or other mundane

material possessions. Instead, wyrmwraiths

seek knowledge or items to reverse or

improve their undead condition. Their

own loathing of what they have become is

the only thing as strong as their hatred of

the living. Yet, despite their predicament,

they still _fear_ ultimate death.

A _wyrmwraith_ blights the land with

its very presence, a slowly spreading stain

tainting anything it touches. Undead activity

inevitably increases in any area a _wyrmwraith_

inhabits. Unless a _wyrmwraith_ is

destroyed, its territory often becomes a

lifeless wasteland for miles.

Wyrmwraiths are very dangerous

opponents in combat. They prefer to

soften up enemies with their breath

weapon and spells before closing in for

melee. Wyrmwraiths target clerics, paladins,

and other spellcasters wielding divine magic, both

because _[[spells/They Know|they know]]_ divine magic possesses the greatest

threat to them and because they see it as a chance to

_[[feats/Strike Back|strike back]]_ against the gods for their _[[feats/Accursed|accursed]]_ state.

Wyrmwraiths care little about how many of their undead

minions are destroyed in combat. They are merely pawns

to the wyrmwraiths, who have the means at their disposal

to create more.

Wyrmwraiths appear as skeletal, ghostly versions of

their former selves, their features warped by malice. No

matter the size they once possessed, wyrmwraiths measure

roughly 50 ft. from snout to tail. Unencumbered by f lesh,

they move with a silent, effortless, and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ _[[spells/Grace|grace]]_. Even

wyrmwraiths’ minds become changed in undeath. Already

long-lived creatures when they were dragons, some

wyrmwraiths have spent an even longer time as undead.

Brooding and nurturing brutal hatred for the living for

so long drives these wyrmwraiths insane, causing them

to become reckless—or self-destructive—and to venture

out into the night to rain down _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ on a nearby

settlement or even an entire kingdom, knowing that they

will eventually be hunted down and destroyed.
