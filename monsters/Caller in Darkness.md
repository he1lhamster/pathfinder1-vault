  Consume Mind (Su): Whenever a caller in darkness hits a creature with its incorporeal
    touch attack, or begins its turn occupying the same space as a creature, it drains
    away a portion of that creature's mind, inflicting 1d4 points of Wisdom damage.
    This is a mind-affecting effect, but not a negative energy effect. If the caller
    in darkness reduces a living creature's Wisdom score to 0 in this way, it absorbs
    that creature's mind, killing it. The caller in darkness gains psychic energy
    equal to the creature's HD and access to all of the creature's memories. A creature
    whose mind is absorbed in this way cannot be resurrected until the caller in darkness
    is slain, unless the caster first uses a wish or miracle to free the creature's
    mind.
  Wrap in Despair (Su): Any living creature that begins its turn occupying the same
    space as a caller in darkness must succeed on a DC 21 Will save or be overwhelmed
    by crippling depression for 1d4 rounds. Affected creatures are unable to take
    any action. Adjacent allies can offer words of encouragement as a standard action
    to grant the creature a new saving throw. If the creature succeeds on a saving
    throw granted in this way, it is immune to the caller in darkness's wrap in despair
    ability for 24 hours. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less are immune
    to this effect. This is a mind-affecting, emotion, and fear effect. The saving
    throw DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: A caller in darkness grows from the psychic remains of a creature with
  psychic sensitivity that died a violent death, its restless spirit compelled to
  visit upon others the horrors that it suffered before dying. As more and more minds
  are absorbed, it grows, and the original spirit is lost in the swirling mass of
  hatred, confusion, and despair.

**Wrap in Despair (Su)** Any living creature that begins its turn occupying the same space as a _caller in darkness_ must succeed on a DC 21 Will save or be overwhelmed by crippling depression for 1d4 rounds. Affected creatures are unable to take any action. Adjacent allies can offer words of encouragement as a standard action to grant the creature a new saving throw. If the creature succeeds on a saving throw granted in this way, it is immune to the _caller in darkness_’s wrap in despair ability for 24 hours. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less are immune to this effect. This is a mind-affecting, emotion, and _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effect. The saving throw DC is Charisma-based.
