  Suffocating Water (Su): Once per day as a standard action, a vodyanoi can cause
    the water surrounding it up to a radius of 30 feet to grow thick and slimy, making
    it difficult for water-breathing creatures within the area other than vodyanois
    to breathe. A vodyanoi can control narrow currents of breathable water to provide
    oxygen to up to 3 other creatures in the area of effect-vodyanois themselves are
    immune to this effect. All other creatures in an area of suffocating water must
    hold their breath or risk suffocation. Once created, an area of suffocating water
    does not move-it persists for a number of minutes equal to the vodyanoi's Hit
    Dice. The slimy water does not impact swim speeds or visibility in any significant
    manner. A creature can make a DC 20 Perception check to notice the difference
    between suffocating water and any normal water that may surround it.
desc_long: |-
  Vodyanois resemble humanoid salamanders. They have short noses, bulging eyes, and broad mouths covered with thickets of fleshy tendrils. Skin color varies wildly depending on the climate and terrain, from drab greens and grays to vibrant oranges and reds. Vodyanois stand roughly 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh just over 100 pounds. They can live up to 120 years.

  Vodyanois are well known as enemies to boggards-another amphibious race often encountered in proximity to vodyanoi lands. While vodyanois themselves are rarely evil, they are capricious and often quick to anger, particularly when they feel their territories have been intruded upon. Their hatred of boggards is another sure way to arouse their anger-a vodyanoi who suspects one of boggard collusion will often attack on sight. Those who live in close proximity to vodyanoi tribes learn quickly to leave the folk alone, and when visits or intrusions into vodyanoi lands are necessary (such as when one might need to seek out a vodyanoi for aid in curing a disease), gifts of magic potions and exotic fruits are highly recommended.

##### Description

Vodyanois resemble humanoid salamanders. They have short noses, bulging eyes, and broad mouths covered with thickets of fleshy tendrils. Skin color varies wildly depending on the climate and terrain, from drab greens and grays to vibrant oranges and reds. Vodyanois stand roughly 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh just over 100 pounds. They can live up to 120 years.

Vodyanois are well known as enemies to boggards—another _amphibious_ race often encountered in proximity to _vodyanoi_ lands. While vodyanois themselves are rarely evil, they are capricious and often quick to anger, particularly when they feel their territories have been intruded upon. Their hatred of boggards is another sure way to arouse their anger—a _vodyanoi_ who suspects one of _[[monsters/Boggard|boggard]]_ collusion will often attack on sight. Those who live in close proximity to _vodyanoi_ tribes learn quickly to leave the folk alone, and when visits or intrusions into _vodyanoi_ lands are necessary (such as when one might need to seek out a _vodyanoi_ for aid in curing a disease), gifts of magic potions and exotic fruits are highly recommended.
