  Dream Web (Ex): A dream spider's webs have an iridescent hue, making them easier

    or monstrous humanoid that contacts these webs experiences strange hallucinations,
    taking 1 point of Wisdom damage per round of contact. A successful DC 11 Fortitude
    save negates this damage. If the webs of a dream spider are burned, they spread
    poisonous gas in a 10-foot radius. This gas deals 1d4 points of Wisdom damage
    to all creatures in the area (not just to those in contact with the webs). A successful
    DC 11 Fortitude save halves this damage. The cloud of colorful vapor remains for
    1 round only before dissipating harmlessly. The Wisdom damage effect of a dream
    web is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Poison (Ex): Bite-injury; save Fort DC 11; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect
    1d2 Wis; cure 1 save.
desc_long: Transplants from the Mwangi Expanse (where these spiders can grow to truly
  enormous proportions), dream spiders have become a significant but valuable infestation
  in Korvosa's Shingles, for the venom of one of these spiders can be distilled into
  the popular but dangerous drug known as shiver.
