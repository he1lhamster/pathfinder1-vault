special_abilities:
  All-Around Vision (Ex): A gibbering mouther sees in all directions at once. It cannot
    be flanked.
  Amorphous (Ex): A gibbering mouther's body is malleable and shapeless. It is immune
    to precision damage (like sneak attacks) and critical hits, and can move through
    an area as small as one-quarter its space without squeezing or one-eighth its
    space when squeezing.
  Blood Drain (Ex): On a successful grapple check after grabbing, several of the creature's
    mouths attach to its target. Each round it maintains its grapple, its mouths automatically
    deal 1d4 points of bite damage and 1 point of Constitution damage as it drains
    its victim's blood.
  Engulf (Ex): This ability functions as swallow whole, except for the following changes.
    An engulfed creature is trapped in the gibbering mouther's body, where several
    of its mouths continue to feed and drain blood. A gibbering mouther can engulf
    only one foe of its size or smaller at a time. If an engulfed creature cuts its
    way free (the mouther's damage reduction still applies to those inside), the mouther
    simply flows together again and can still use its engulf attack.
  Gibbering (Su): As a free action, a gibbering mouther can emit a cacophony of maddening
    sound. All creatures other than gibbering mouthers within 60 feet must succeed
    on a DC 13 Will save or be confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion
    insanity effect. A creature that saves cannot be affected by the same mouther's
    gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Ground Manipulation (Su): At will as a standard action, a gibbering mouther can
    cause stone and earth under its body to grow soft and muddy. The ground remains
    muddy for 1 minute after the mouther moves off of the location. A gibbering mouther
    can move through these areas with ease, but other creatures treat them as difficult
    terrain.
  Spittle (Ex): Each round as a free action, a gibbering mouther can emit a stream
    of acidic spittle at one target within 30 feet. On a successful attack, the target
    is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless he succeeds on a DC 18 Fortitude save. The save
    DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: Disgusting, loathsome, and hungry-these are the only words that properly
  describe the gibbering mouther. A foul beast that lurks in underground caves, sewers,
  and nightmares, mouthers have no societal, ecological or religious significance
  other than their ability to drive those that listen to them mad. Some scholars believe
  that gibbering mouthers are a lesser variant of the much more dangerous shoggoth,
  while others theorize they are a punishment by some powerful being or deity inflicted
  on those who have offended it.
