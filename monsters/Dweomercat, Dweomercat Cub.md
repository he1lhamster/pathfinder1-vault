  Dweomer Leap (Su): When a dweomercat is targeted by a spell or within the area of
    effect of a spell, it can, as a swift action, choose to teleport to a square adjacent
    to the spell's caster, effectively appearing mid-leap and aimed toward the caster.
    This ability takes effect regardless of whether or not the spell overcomes the
    dweomercat's spell resistance. If it chooses, the dweomercat can immediately make
    a full attack against the spell's caster as though pouncing. Using this ability
    does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If there is no safe space adjacent
    to the caster-or if the dweomercat chooses-the dweomercat can forgo using this
    ability.
desc_long: |-
  Powerful and regal, dweomercats stalk the First World, preying upon lesser creatures, but more voraciously hunting new and ever stranger sources of magic. Beings as much composed of sculpted arcane eddies as of flesh and blood, these capricious felines flourish along the intangible ley lines of their home realm, drinking in its weird powers as a plant thrives on light. Yet even more potent than their thirst for magic and the euphoria they draw from being in proximity to the reshaping of reality is dweomercats' racial curiosity, which leads them endlessly across the First World-and often beyond.

  The average adult dweomercat is about 4 feet tall and 7 feet long, weighing over 250 pounds, while their cubs are approximately 1 foot tall and weigh no more than 15 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**Dweomer Leap (Su)** When a _dweomercat_ is targeted by a spell or within the area of effect of a spell, it can, as a swift action, choose to teleport to a square adjacent to the spell’s caster, effectively appearing mid-leap and aimed toward the caster. This ability takes effect regardless of whether or not the spell overcomes the _dweomercat_’s _[[universal monster rules/Spell Resistance|spell resistance]]_. If it chooses, the _dweomercat_ can immediately make a full attack against the spell’s caster as though pouncing. Using this ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If there is no safe space adjacent to the caster—or if the _dweomercat_ chooses—the _dweomercat_ can forgo using this ability.

##### Description

Powerful and regal, dweomercats stalk the First World, preying upon lesser creatures, but more voraciously hunting new and ever stranger sources of magic. Beings as much composed of sculpted arcane eddies as of flesh and blood, these capricious felines flourish along the intangible ley lines of their home realm, drinking in its _[[spells/Weird|weird]]_ powers as a plant thrives on light. Yet even more _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ than their thirst for magic and the euphoria they draw from being in proximity to the reshaping of reality is dweomercats’ racial curiosity, which leads them endlessly across the First World—and often beyond.

The average adult _dweomercat_ is about 4 feet tall and 7 feet long, weighing over 250 pounds, while their cubs are approximately 1 foot tall and weigh no more than 15 pounds.
