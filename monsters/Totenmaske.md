  Charisma Drain (Su): A totenmaske can eat the hopes and dreams of a creature it
    bites, dealing 1d4 points of Charisma drain unless the victim makes a DC 21 Will
    save. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Fleshdrink (Su): If a totenmaske hits a single creature with both claw attacks,
    the hollow claws drain away some of the target's flesh, dealing 1d6 points of
    Constitution damage and making the victim sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful
    DC 19 Fortitude save negates the Constitution damage and reduces the sickened
    condition duration to 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Shape Flesh (Su): 'By spending 1 minute in contact with a helpless creature, a totenmaske
    can reshape the target's face, causing flesh to cover vital features. The target
    may attempt a DC 19 Fortitude save to resist. Changes are permanent, but can be
    reversed with heal, restoration, or regeneration, or by surgically opening the
    sealed flesh with a DC 15 Heal check that takes 1d3 rounds and deals 1d4 points
    of damage even if the check is not successful. A totenmaske can use this ability
    on one of four different features per use: ears (target becomes deaf), eyes (target
    becomes blind), mouth (target cannot speak or eat), or nose (target cannot smell).
    Multiple uses can have increasingly serious effects (such as sealing the mouth
    and nose, which causes suffocation). The save DC is Charisma-based.'
desc_long: |-
  Consumed by the same lusts and excesses that led them in life, the souls of some sinners rise as totenmaskes, drinking the flesh and memories of living creatures and even stepping into their lives to once more pursue their base desires. Incapable of resuming their sinful pursuits in their natural form, totenmaskes often keep their victims alive for as long as possible, renewing their stolen identities regularly in order to continue indulging in pleasures of the flesh.

  A totenmaske can be created from the corpse of a sinful mortal by a cleric of at least 18th level using the create greater undead spell.

  A totenmaske is 6 feet tall and weighs 140 pounds.

##### Description

Consumed by the same lusts and excesses that led them in life, the souls of some sinners rise as totenmaskes, drinking the flesh and memories of living creatures and even stepping into their lives to once more pursue their base desires. Incapable of resuming their sinful pursuits in their natural form, totenmaskes often keep their victims alive for as long as possible, renewing their stolen identities regularly in order to continue indulging in pleasures of the flesh.

A _totenmaske_ can be created from the corpse of a sinful mortal by a _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ of at least 18th level using the _[[spells/Create Greater Undead|create greater undead]]_ spell.

A _totenmaske_ is 6 feet tall and weighs 140 pounds.
