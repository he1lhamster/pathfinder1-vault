  Breath Weapon (Su): A tongue of rebuke has one type of breath weapon, a line of
    acid, cold, fire, or lightning (10d8 damage, Reflex DC 15), 80 feet in length.
    Once a tongue of rebuke breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later.
  Imbued Energy (Ex): 'Each tongue of rebuke is imbued with one of the following energy
    types: acid, cold, fire, or lightning. It is immune to this type of energy and
    its breath weapon is of this energy type.'
  Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a tongue of rebuke must hit with its bite
    attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking
    an attack of opportunity.
  Roar (Su): A tongue of rebuke can loose a devastating roar every 1d4 rounds. All
    creatures except dragons and tongues of rebuke within 120 feet must succeed on
    a DC 16 Will save or become shaken for 4d6 rounds. Those within 30 feet who fail
    their saves become panicked for 4d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Unbinding (Ex): If a tongue of rebuke is reduced to 0 hp, its energy is released
    in a blast equivalent to its breath weapon with a radius of 20 feet.
desc_long: |-
  The tongues of rebuke exist to serve the interests of dragonkind by performing the most menial of roles and are typically encountered as guardians of important sites. Their inability to do more than follow simple commands, combined with their agelessness, has been known to leave them guarding a site long after its significance has passed.

  Typical Physical Characteristics: The scaled iron body of a tongue of rebuke measures twenty feet in length and two feet in diameter. Depending on the type of energy it was imbued with, the edges of its scales might crackle with electricity, whiten with frost, glow red with heat, or glisten with acid. An inert tongue of rebuke weighs two tons, but they are naturally weightless.
