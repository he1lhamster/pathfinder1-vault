special_abilities:
  Adaptive Tracker (Ex): As a full-round action, a collector robot can adapt itself
    to any environment in which it travels, granting it a +2 bonus on initiative checks
    and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks while in that
    kind of terrain.
  Integrated Stun Gun (Ex): A collector robot has an integrated stun gun slung beneath
    its body. This weapon uses a powerful sonic amplifier to produce powerful lowfrequency
    blasts of energy that pummel targets. This weapon has a range increment of 20
    feet, and it deals 1d8 points of nonlethal damage. On a critical hit, the robot
    can attempt a free trip combat maneuver (CMB +12) against the target, which does
    not provoke attacks of opportunity.
  Integrated Tracking (Ex): A collector robot has integrated systems that allow it
    to tag and track creatures. As a fullround action, a collector robot can implant
    a tracker chipTG into the body of a target that it is grappling or a helpless
    target. Once implanted, the tracker chip is activated and the collector robot's
    chipfinder can detect the presence of the implanted tracker chip within 1 mile.
    It uses a signal to locate the tracker chips, and this signal can be blocked by
    1 foot of metal, 5 feet of stone, or 20 feet of organic matter. A tracker chip
    can be removed with a sharp tool. Doing so deals 1 point of damage. Once an implanted
    tracker chip is removed from the body (or remains in a body after it dies) it
    retains enough energy to continue to be detected by the collector robot's sensors
    for 1 week.
  Reactive Gyros (Ex): The rotors that grant a collector robot flight also provide
    quick reactions to threats and external stimuli, granting it a +3 racial bonus
    on Reflex saves.
desc_long: |-
  Serving as long-distance scouts, trackers, and acquisition agents, collector robots see frequent use in the study and collection of alien life forms on new worlds. They can operate independently for years, cataloging unique species while enduring extreme environments that would overwhelm their biological makers. These machines may tag a captive creature with a tracker chip that can be monitored and tracked with their integrated chipfinders. They do so to observe and document the behavioral patterns of such creatures from afar, studying viable specimens for days until they eventually isolate and retrieve the studied prey again for further examination in the controlled laboratories of the robots' masters.

  Among their more impressive features, collector robots possess a hardened artificial intelligence, maintaining a singular focus on their mission directives even when wandering out of communication range with their owners. They tend to react swiftly to movement and perceived threats to their physical security, either emitting loud tones or alarms as a preemptive warning, or flying upward to gain altitude before assessing a given situation and potentially opening fire in defense of itself. Some collector robots grow more lax in their analysis protocols over time, giving way to a state similar to paranoia if left in the field for too long. This corrupted logic inevitably leads them to interpret even the most innocuous actions as proof of hostile intent. Other collectors become fixated on their directive to retrieve specimens without undue damage, interpreting it as a need to protect their targets from all possible sources of harm.
