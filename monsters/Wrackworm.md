special_abilities:
  Caustic Ichor (Ex): A wrackworm's blood is a foul, caustic substance that burns
    flesh and dissolves matter. The first time in a round when a creature attacks
    a wrackworm with a melee weapon, the creature must succeed at a DC 27 Reflex saving
    throw or be struck by the creature's blood. On a failed save, the creature takes
    1d6 points of acid damage each time that round it successfully hits the wrackworm
    with a melee weapon. A slashing or piercing melee weapon automatically takes 1d6
    points of acid damage each time it damages a wrackworm. This acid damage ignores
    the first 10 points of a weapon's hardness. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  Disgorge Wracked Reality (Su): Once per minute as a standard action, a wrackworm
    can vomit up the partially digested contents of one of its many stomachs. This
    acts as a breath weapon that deals 10d6 points of acid damage and 10d6 points
    of bludgeoning damage to creatures in a 50-foot cone (Reflex DC 31 half); creatures
    that fail their Reflex saves are also exposed to the worm's poison. The material
    vomited forth by the wrackworm consists of all manner of ruined material-bodies,
    buildings, objects, vegetation, and more. For the following minute, the ground
    in the area affected by this breath weapon becomes difficult terrain that deals
    2d6 points of acid damage to creatures that end their turns on the ground in the
    area. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Penetrating Strikes (Ex): A wrackworm's natural attacks ignore damage reduction
    and hardness.
  Planar Anchor (Ex): Although a wrackworm is an extraplanar outsider, it cannot be
    banished from or forced to travel to another plane (including temporary extradimensional
    spaces, such as the one created by maze) unless it wishes to be affected by the
    effect.
  Poison (Ex): Sting-contact or injury; save Fort DC 31; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds;
    effect 1d4 Str drain and 1d4 Con drain; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC
    is Constitution-based.
  Twisting Coils (Su): A wrackworm's immense coiled body reacts instinctively to avoid
    attacks that merely need to touch the creature to affect it, shifting and twisting
    out of the way with unnerving speed. The first time each round a wrackworm is
    attacked by anything that resolves against its touch AC, the wrackworm gains a
    +30 dodge bonus against that attack.
  Wrack Reality (Su): As a move action, a wrackworm can gnaw through the walls of
    reality to create a vertically aligned dimensional portal. It can do so to create
    a portal that links an adjacent space to another visible space within 1 mile,
    or it can do so to create an interplanar portal between its current plane and
    a plane of its choice (typically at a random point on the other plane, as most
    wrackworms have little capacity or interest in precision travel). Once the portal
    is created, it remains in effect as long as the wrackworm is adjacent to it. The
    portal itself consists of a 10-foot-diameter hole in reality-large enough for
    a Large creature (or a creature with the compression ability, such as a wrackworm)
    to pass through. The hole does not undermine structural integrity or otherwise
    damage objects in the region it exists in. A wrackworm can use this hole to attack
    distant foes (and often does so to attack foes who use ranged superiority or flight
    against the worm), or crawl through the hole to reach a new location. This ability
    functions even in areas where planar travel does not function (as in the case
    of areas under the effects of dimensional lock or forbiddance) or if the effect
    that bars planar travel functions at caster level 20th or lower, but in such areas
    the ability requires a standard action rather than a move action to activate.
    Once the wrackworm is not adjacent to the portal, it immediately closes. A creature
    standing partially in the portal when it closes must decide which side of the
    portal it wishes to fully emerge from as it closes.
desc_long: |-
  Wrackworms are a parasitic blight upon the planes that glut on the flesh of Rovagug, the imprisoned god of destruction, and their all-consuming hunger grows with every nibble of the Rough Beast's tainted essence. Rovagug himself is not harmed by the wrackworms gnawing on his flanks, but now and then, the chewing grows irritating enough that the Rough Beast gives a mighty shudder that hurls the wrackworms aside, whereupon their massive jaws reflexively gnaw holes into the underlying reality of the Dead Vault, allowing the immense monsters to burrow into other planes and spread far and wide throughout the Great Beyond. No wrackworm ever returns to the Dead Vault once it burrows out of it, and their violent emergence from the prison demiplane does not seem to undermine that reality's function as a prison, but many worry that, in time, the constant burrowing exit of the wrackworms may damage the Dead Vault enough that Rovagug himself may be able to finally escape.

   Each wrackworm is a towering hulk of segmented plates, an earthworm grown to titanic size. Its eyeless head is almost all mouth, with a gigantic maw filled with needle teeth. From its sides spring four long, chitinous limbs, each tipped with a razor-sharp scythe of hardened bone. At the caudal end of the worm is a long stinger like that of a scorpion, dripping with a flesh-ravaging toxin. Despite its bulk and sluggishness, a wrackworm moves with great swiftness when it wants to, darting forward to sink its fangs into a fleeing morsel or bothersome archer.

   The arrival of a wrackworm in a world is an apocalyptic event, made more so by its abruptness. A wrackworm rarely cares about reaching a specific destination so long as something exists therein to consume. This drive to feed on matter is not a biological imperative, for as an outsider a wrackworm has no physical need to eat. Instead, its desire to feed is driven purely by its entropic cruelty.

   Despite their mighty stature today, the first wrackworms were of humble origin. When the gods tore open the world and created Rovagug's prison, the Dead Vault, a vast amount of earth and stone were captured as well. The vermin infesting this soil, faced with few other options, fed upon the divine flesh of the Rough Beast. Generation upon generation of feasting on the flesh of a slumbering god has mutated these vermin into towering engines of gluttony and devastation-wrackworms.

   Some planar scholars claim to see a pattern in the wrackworms' boring of the planes. The treatises of these fanatical scholars posit that the worms are gnawing in precise patterns as part of a qlippoth plot to unmake the very fabric of the planes, unweaving all of reality to finish what the Rough Beast cannot as long as he remains trapped within the Dead Vault. Wrackworm infestations are also reputed to exist in the deepest parts of the Abyss, in a realm known as the Spiral Path, raising questions about a link to the demon lord Yhidothrus-himself a mighty wormlike beast.

   A wrackworm is 80 feet long when fully uncoiled and weighs 30,000 pounds.

##### Description

Wrackworms are a parasitic _[[spells/Blight|blight]]_ upon the planes that glut on the flesh of Rovagug, the imprisoned god of _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_, and their all-consuming hunger grows with every nibble of the Rough Beast’s tainted essence. Rovagug himself is not harmed by the wrackworms gnawing on his flanks, but now and then, the chewing grows irritating enough that the Rough Beast gives a mighty shudder that hurls the wrackworms aside, whereupon their massive jaws reflexively gnaw holes into the underlying reality of the Dead Vault, allowing the immense monsters to _burrow_ into other planes and spread far and wide throughout the Great Beyond.
