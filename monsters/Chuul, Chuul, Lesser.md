  little more than aggressive crustaceans prior to aboleth meddling. Only after successive

  they are today, and their keen intelligence likewise came from their aboleth masters'
  uplifting.

##### Description

Long before the aboleths uplifted humanity, these deep-sea-dwelling entities experimented on other aquatic life forms, perfecting the art of genetic manipulation and developing entities that would become their unyielding servants. The creatures known as chuuls today (a derivation of their alghollthu name, “chu’ulothis”) were little more than aggressive crustaceans prior to aboleth meddling. Only after successive generations of _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Guided|guided]]_ evolution were chuuls transformed into the hulking monstrosities they are today, and their _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Keen|keen]]_ intelligence likewise came from their aboleth masters’ uplifting.
