##### Description

A _psychepore_ is a symbiosis of two different plant

creatures—a lurching bit of undergrowth distantly

related to the _[[monsters/Shambling Mound|shambling mound]]_ and an intelligent

cluster of hard fungal growths that possess a _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Malevolent|malevolent]]_

hive mind. On their own, the shambling undergrowth

is an unintelligent creature, barely aware enough to

move itself to new sources of sunlight and water, while

the fungal conks, for their part, are intelligent but

immobile. The two pose a serious threat only once the

_[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ fungus infests the shambling undergrowth, and

the creatures transform into the horrifying _psychepore_.

A _psychepore_ procreates through microorganisms in

its poison, spreading into victims fungal spores that

try to bond with that host’s physiology to create a

new _psychepore_. Generally, the only creatures

with which these spores can coexist are

the shambles that form the base of a

_psychepore_, but these spores also have

strange effects on creatures that aren’t

their typical hosts. Such

creatures suffer from

delusional visions as

their minds try to

assimilate or reject the

images presented by the

alien will of the strange

symbionts, and their bodies

desperately attempt to force

the foreign spores out. Some

cultures harvest psychepores

to distill their poison into

a powerful drug, using it in

religious rituals that search for

inner knowledge or in dark alleys

as a temporary escape from _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_,

short lives—or transforming it into

a truth serum used during psychological

torture and other types of _[[spells/Interrogation|interrogation]]_.

Most psychepores attack only in vain

attempts to procreate, never _[[spells/Seeming|seeming]]_ frustrated by their

usually futile efforts, but more intelligent specimens

pursue less direct but more fruitful approaches, often

serving those who aid in gathering the undergrowth

they need to replicate. There are rumors of even more

highly developed and intelligent versions of these

creatures that learn the secrets of _[[universal monster rules/Telepathy|telepathy]]_ and how to

adjust their poison to replicate _[[spells/Possession|possession]]_ magic. These

superintelligent psychepores become more aware of

cultural structures and take great joy in manipulating

other forms of life to achieve their goals.

A _psychepore_ is a hulking thing with a dense

composition. It stands 6 feet tall or slightly taller and

weighs about 300 pounds.
