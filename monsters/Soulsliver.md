    mirror within 500 feet as if using dimension door (caster level 7th). It can remain
    within that mirror indefinitely, or on its next turn crawl out or use this ability

  A soulsliver causes trouble for a short while in its assumed form, then retreats through the mirror to its home plane. Its native plane is an aspect of the Plane of Shadow, with reversed and grossly distorted creatures and scenery from the Material Plane.

**Death Throes (Su)** When a _[[monsters/Soulsliver|soulsliver]]_ is killed, its body explodes into jagged glass shards that deal 2d6 points of piercing and slashing damage to creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst (Reflex DC 12 half). The save DC is Constitution-based.

It can remain within that _mirror_ indefinitely, or on its next turn crawl out or use this ability again. Its _compression_ ability allows it to enter or exit Diminutive or larger mirrors. It can only exit a _mirror_ if it is using _change shape_ to take a specific creature’s form.

##### Description

However, it is always the _mirror image_ of the person it copies, which might give away that something is wrong.

A _soulsliver_ is an extradimensional shapechanger that lurks in the half-dimensions behind mirrors. It watches creatures on the Material Plane through ref lective surfaces, assumes their likeness, then crawls through the _mirror_ to kill and feast upon its prey. Whether they are bizarre offshoots of the _[[monsters/Doppelganger|doppelganger]]_ race or originate from some aberrant magic used to create a demiplane, soulslivers are responsible for many unsolved murders, and their _mirror_ travel makes them hard to catch.

A _soulsliver_ causes trouble for a short while in its assumed form, then retreats through the _mirror_ to its home plane. Its native plane is an aspect of the Plane of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|Shadow]]_, with reversed and grossly distorted creatures and scenery from the Material Plane.
