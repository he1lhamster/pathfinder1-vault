  misery by outwitting their enemies rather than out-muscling them. Tangle tenders
  belong to the maze; they are intimately familiar with every twist and turn, and
  are keen to introduce interlopers to each in turn. Among minotaur tribes, tangle
  tenders hold a strange position, both necessary and loathed. They never shy away
  from bragging about their genius, and their kin recognize the value of a tangle
  tender's devices for trapping prey. But minotaurs respect strength, courage, and
  aggression first and foremost, and these clever rogues excel at none of those qualities-most
  thus see these trapsmiths as socially stunted, needlessly sadistic (even by minotaur
  standards), and physically weak to the point of embarrassment. Few voice these opinions,
  however, as those who do frequently face tragic accidents deep within the maze.

##### Description

Weaker than many of their brutish kin, tangle tenders instead apply their racial _cunning_ and understanding of complex systems to mechanical devices, constructing ingenious traps that whittle away those lost in the labyrinths with little or no direct danger to themselves. They build and reset traps, alter or conceal carefully whatever trails their victims attempt to leave, and strike from the shadows only once their victims are desperate, _[[conditions/Exhausted|exhausted]]_, and at each others’ throats. Their tactics aren’t motivated by cowardice; rather, these _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_ creators love to inflict misery by outwitting their enemies rather than out-muscling them. Tangle tenders belong to the _[[spells/Maze|maze]]_; they are intimately familiar with every twist and turn, and are _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Keen|keen]]_ to introduce interlopers to each in turn. Among _minotaur_ tribes, tangle tenders hold a strange position, both necessary and loathed. They never shy away from bragging about their genius, and their kin recognize the value of a tangle tender’s devices for trapping prey. But minotaurs respect strength, courage, and aggression first and foremost, and these clever rogues excel at none of those qualities—most thus see these trapsmiths as socially stunted, needlessly sadistic (even by _minotaur_ standards), and physically weak to the point of embarrassment. Few voice these opinions, however, as those who do frequently face tragic accidents deep within the _maze_.
