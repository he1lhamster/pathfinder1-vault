    Three times per day as a standard action, the moon hag can howl a litany of dreadful prognostications at a creature within 30 feet. The predictions afflict the victim, gnawing away at its sanity. This is a language-dependent curse effect; if a moon (including Groetus) is visible to the victim, it takes a -2 penalty on the save against the effect.

     Dreadful Ravings-curse; save Will DC 18; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Wisdom damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Lunatic Insight (Su): A moon hag adds her Charisma modifier as an insight bonus
    to AC and on initiative checks. These bonuses increase by 2 when a moon (including
    Groetus) is visible above (this increase is not included in the statistics above).
desc_long: |-
  Moon hags are foul prophets that haunt the Boneyard's endless tombs, serving Groetus, the skull-faced moon hanging eternally above. These lurid hags almost universally worship Groetus, and many claim to be mouthpieces for this god of oblivion.

   Moon hags are extremely knowledgeable about the secret paths and portals of the Boneyard, and they often use this knowledge to journey to the Material Plane for sinister purposes. Most moon hags use this opportunity to birth and abandon changelings, seeing even their wayward daughters as agents of Groetus's will.

   Moon hag changelings are especially pale-skinned, and many are plagued by chronic anxiety, leading them to become reclusive. The daughter of a moon hag gains the moon daughter racial trait: she gains a +1 insight bonus to her AC but takes a -2 penalty on Will saving throws. If a moon is visible, the bonus and penalty each increase by 1.

##### Description

Moon hags are foul prophets that haunt the Boneyard’s endless tombs, serving Groetus, the skull-faced moon hanging eternally above. These lurid hags almost universally worship Groetus, and many claim to be mouthpieces for this god of _[[monsters/Oblivion|oblivion]]_.

Moon hags are extremely knowledgeable about the secret paths and portals of the Boneyard, and they often use this knowledge to journey to the Material Plane for sinister purposes. Most moon hags use this opportunity to birth and abandon changelings, seeing even their wayward daughters as agents of Groetus’s will.

Moon hag changelings are especially pale-skinned, and many are plagued by chronic anxiety, leading them to become reclusive. The daughter of a moon hag gains the moon daughter racial trait: she gains a +1 insight bonus to her AC but takes a –2 penalty on Will saving throws. If a moon is visible, the bonus and penalty each increase by 1.
