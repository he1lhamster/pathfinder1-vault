special_abilities:
  Atavistic Manipulation (Su): A thorgothrel can alter a target's genetic structure
    to induce rapid evolutionary regression by dealing Intelligence bleed damage with
    its slam attacks. As the target mentally regresses, it also becomes more feral
    and violent. A target that has taken at least 4 points of Intelligence damage
    from a thorgothrel gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength. If a thorgothrel
    spends an hour experimenting on a target rendered unconscious due to Intelligence
    damage, it can make this regression permanent. Thereafter, the target's Intelligence
    score is reduced to 1. This regression can be reversed only with heal, limited
    wish, miracle, or wish. At the GM's discretion, the target might change in additional
    ways to reflect its atavistic regression.
  Force Field (Ex): A thorgothrel with a silver armature is sheathed in a thin layer
    of shimmering energy that grants 40 bonus hit points. All damage dealt to a thorgothrel
    with an active force field is reduced from these hit points first. As long as
    the force field is active, the thorgothrel is immune to critical hits. A thorgothrel's
    force field has fast healing 10, but once its hit points are reduced to 0, the
    force field shuts down and can only be reactivated if the thorgothrel spends a
    fullround action and succeeds at a DC 15 Disable Device check. If successful,
    the force field reactivates with 1 hit point.
  Force Ray (Ex): As a standard action, a thorgothrel can lose 5 hit points from its
    force field (if it has that many or more remaining) in order to fire a ray of
    force at any target within 100 feet. The ray is a ranged touch attack that deals
    10d6 points of force damage.
  Poisonous Sublimation (Ex): When a thorgothrel without an active force field is
    in a region with breathable atmosphere, it beings to evaporate into a poisonous
    mist. The thorgothrel takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round at the
    beginning of its turn, and the mist expands to fill a 20-foot radius. Any living
    creature in the mist with 6 or fewer HD must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save
    or be slain. A creature with more than 6 HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage
    each round while in the mist (Fortitude half). A moderate wind disperses the mist
    in 4 rounds; a strong wind disperses the mist in 1 round. This is a poison effect,
    and the save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
  Thorgothrels are a spacefaring race of aggressive genetic manipulators. In their natural form, thorgothrels are blobs of protoplasm 12 feet in diameter that move with awkward undulation. Thorgothrels can extrude pseudopods in order to manipulate objects and form simple tools. These pseudopods excrete a complex cocktail of chemicals that can force changes to a victim's underlying genetic structure.

  Weighed down by Golarion's gravity and quick to sublimate into poisonous vapor in the atmosphere, thorgothrels find Golarion (and similar planets) inherently inimical. A thorgothrel can move about on Golarion only by wrapping its body around a frame of silver rods that provides inner support and encases the creature in a resilient force field barrier. Despite the hazard Golarion's atmosphere poses to these alien creatures, the planet's staggering diversity of life presents a veritable cornucopia of beings upon which they can perform their genetic experimentations, inching closer to their goal of returning all creatures to a primeval, atavistic state.

  The silver armature largely determines the exact size of a thorgothrel, but a typical thorgothrel stands around 11 feet tall and weighs about 900 lbs.

### Special Abilities

**Atavistic Manipulation (Su)** A _[[monsters/Thorgothrel|thorgothrel]]_ can alter a target’s genetic structure to induce rapid evolutionary regression by dealing Intelligence _bleed_ damage with its slam attacks. As the target mentally regresses, it also becomes more feral and violent. A target that has taken at least 4 points of Intelligence damage from a _thorgothrel_ gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength. If a _thorgothrel_ spends an hour experimenting on a target rendered _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_ due to Intelligence damage, it can make this regression permanent. Thereafter, the target’s Intelligence score is reduced to 1. This regression can be reversed only with _heal_, _[[spells/Limited Wish|limited wish]]_, _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_, or _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_. At the GM’s discretion, the target might change in additional ways to reflect its atavistic regression.

**Force Field (Ex)** A _thorgothrel_ with a silver armature is sheathed in a thin layer of shimmering energy that grants 40 bonus hit points. All damage dealt to a _thorgothrel_ with an active force field is reduced from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the _thorgothrel_ is immune to critical hits. A _thorgothrel_’s force field has _[[universal monster rules/Fast Healing|fast healing]]_ 10, but once its hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and can only be reactivated if the _thorgothrel_ spends a fullround action and succeeds at a DC 15 Disable Device check. If successful, the force field reactivates with 1 hit point.

**Force Ray (Ex)** As a standard action, a _thorgothrel_ can lose 5 hit points from its force field (if it has that many or more remaining) in order to fire a ray of force at any target within 100 feet. The ray is a ranged touch attack that deals 10d6 points of force damage.

**Poisonous Sublimation (Ex)** When a _thorgothrel_ without an active force field is in a region with breathable atmosphere, it beings to evaporate into a poisonous mist. The _thorgothrel_ takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round at the beginning of its turn, and the mist expands to fill a 20-foot radius. Any living creature in the mist with 6 or fewer HD must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or be slain. A creature with more than 6 HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round while in the mist (Fortitude half). A moderate wind disperses the mist in 4 rounds; a strong wind disperses the mist in 1 round. This is a poison effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.

Thorgothrels are a spacefaring race of aggressive genetic manipulators. In their natural form, thorgothrels are blobs of protoplasm 12 feet in diameter that move with awkward undulation. Thorgothrels can extrude pseudopods in order to manipulate objects and form simple tools.
