special_abilities:
  Deaf (Ex): Akatas cannot hear. They are immune to spells and effects that rely on
    hearing to function, but they also cannot make Perception checks to listen.
  Hibernation (Ex): Akatas can enter a state of hibernation for an indefinite period
    of time when food is scarce. When an akata wishes to enter hibernation, it seeks
    out a den and surrounds itself in a layer of fibrous material excreted from its
    mouth-these fibers quickly harden into a dense, almost metallic cocoon. While
    hibernating, an akata does not need to drink or eat. The cocoon has hardness 10
    and 60 hit points, and is immune to fire and bludgeoning (including falling) damage.
    As long as the cocoon remains intact, the akata within remains unharmed. The akata
    remains in a state of hibernation until it senses another living creature within
    10 feet or is exposed to extreme heat, at which point it claws its way to freedom
    in 1d4 minutes as its cocoon degrades to fragments of strange metal.
  Salt Water Vulnerability (Ex): Salt water acts as an extremely strong acid to akatas.
    A splash of salt water deals 1d6 points of damage to an akata, and full immersion
    in salt water deals 4d6 points of damage per round.
  Void Bite (Ex): Akatas hold hundreds of invisibly small larval young within their
    mouths, spreading these parasitic creatures to hosts through their bite. Only
    humanoids make suitable hosts for akata young-all other creature types are immune
    to this parasitic infection. The disease itself is known as void death.
  Disease (Ex): 'Void Death: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 12; onset 1 hour; frequency
    1/day; effect 1d2 Dex and 1d2 Con damage; an infected creature who dies rises
    as a void zombie 2d4 hours later (see below); cure 2 consecutive saves.'
desc_long: Akatas hail from a strange, distant planet that long ago succumbed to a
  cataclysmic end. Countless akatas clung to fragments of the dead planet, entering
  hibernation and riding these asteroids until they eventually crashed upon a new
  planet-akatas' cocoons protected them from the impact, and they soon awoke to seek
  out suitable hosts to spawn their young. Left untended, an akata scourge can quickly
  grow into a significant threat. A typical akata stands 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs
  400 pounds.

**Deaf (Ex)** Akatas cannot hear. They are immune to spells and effects that rely on hearing to function, but they also cannot make Perception checks to listen.

**Hibernation (Ex)** Akatas can enter a state of hibernation for an indefinite period of time when food is scarce. When an _[[monsters/Akata|akata]]_ wishes to enter hibernation, it seeks out a den and surrounds itself in a layer of fibrous material excreted from its mouth—these fibers quickly harden into a dense, almost metallic cocoon.

**Salt Water _[[curses/Vulnerability|Vulnerability]]_ (Ex)** Salt water acts as an extremely strong acid to akatas. A splash of salt water deals 1d6 points of damage to an _akata_, and full immersion in salt water deals 4d6 points of damage per round.

##### Description

Akatas hail from a strange, distant planet that long ago succumbed to a cataclysmic end. Countless akatas clung to fragments of the dead planet, entering hibernation and riding these asteroids until they eventually crashed upon a new planet—akatas’ cocoons protected them from the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Impact|impact]]_, and they soon awoke to seek out suitable hosts to spawn their young. Left untended, an _akata_ scourge can quickly grow into a significant threat. A typical _akata_ stands 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.
