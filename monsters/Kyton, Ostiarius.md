  Compel Courage (Ex): An ostiarius can inspire courage as a 5th-level bard using
    bardic performance, granting a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm
    and fear effects and a +2 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls.
    This ability has a range of 50 feet and affects those creatures the ostiarius
    chooses who also willingly accept the benefits of the effect (no saving throw
    required). The ostiarius's performance compels creatures to perform at dangerous
    extremes. Any living non-outsider that benefits from this ability takes 1 point
    of bleed damage. A creature that accepts these benefits for multiple consecutive
    rounds gains additional points of bleed damage that stack with one another (to
    a maximum of 5). This is an audible, mind-affecting effect and can be countered
    by a bard's countersong class feature.
  Shadow Traveler (Ex): When an ostiarius uses plane shift to travel to the Plane
    of Shadow, it arrives at its intended destination with complete accuracy. When
    an ostiarius uses shadow walk, it moves at 100 miles per hour.
  Unnerving Gaze (Ex): A creature that succumbs to an ostiarius's unnerving gaze becomes
    sickened for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is
    Charisma-based.
desc_long: 'Ostiariuses mind the gate between the world of mortals and the delights
  of the Plane of Shadow. Their role is twofold: admitting their brethren onto the
  Material Plane and-more insidiously- convincing mortals to willingly journey with
  them to their shadowed homeland. They are the emissaries of their race, encouraging
  susceptible mortals to abandon their tired philosophies and embrace the possibilities
  of a realm of inscrutable darkness. Most proudly stand over 6 feet tall, though
  their weights range from exceedingly light to grossly heavy.'

##### Description

Ostiariuses mind the _[[spells/Gate|gate]]_ between the world of mortals and the delights of the Plane of _Shadow_. Their role is twofold: admitting their brethren onto the Material Plane and—more insidiously— convincing mortals to willingly journey with them to their shadowed homeland. They are the emissaries of their race, encouraging susceptible mortals to abandon their tired philosophies and embrace the possibilities of a realm of inscrutable _darkness_. Most proudly stand over 6 feet tall, though their weights range from exceedingly light to grossly heavy.
