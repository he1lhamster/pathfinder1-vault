  Captivating Lure (Su): Once per day, a kelpie can use a powerful mental attack to
    lure in a single creature within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 16 Will saving
    throw or become captivated by the kelpie, thinking it is a desirable woman in
    mortal danger or (if in hippocampus or horse form) a valuable steed. A victim
    under the effects of the captivating lure moves toward the kelpie using the most
    direct means available. If the path leads it into a dangerous area such as through
    fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect
    before moving into peril; the victim does not consider water a dangerous area,
    and will enter the water even if it cannot swim or breathe. A captivated creature
    can take no actions other than to move toward the kelpie and defend itself, even
    if it is drowning. A victim within 5 feet of the kelpie simply stands and offers
    no resistance to its attacks. This effect continues as long as the kelpie is alive
    and the victim is within 1 mile of the kelpie. This is a mind-affecting charm
    effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  A kelpie is a deadly shapechanging predator that, in its natural form, appears as a hideous combination of emaciated horse and sickly humanoid, with slimy, transparent skin and long, stringy hair. Its face is long and equine, with a mouth filled with jagged teeth. Few, however, ever see a kelpie in its true form, for kelpies almost always encounter other creatures while in disguise as a humanoid, horse, or hippocampus, reverting to their true form only after their targets have drowned so that they can feast on their victims, leaving behind only the heart and liver (as both of these organs are distasteful to most kelpies).

  Kelpies can be found in saltwater and freshwater environments, including fens, rivers, swamps, and underground pools and lakes. Communities living near kelpie lairs believe that folk who die on the water or are killed by a kelpie become kelpies themselves. Kelpies may serve as steeds for aquatic fey or other water monsters while in their hippocampus forms, sometimes without their riders ever knowing the truth of the steed's sinister nature.

  A typical kelpie is 6 feet tall and weighs 170 pounds.

##### Description

A _kelpie_ is a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ shapechanging predator that, in its natural form, appears as a hideous combination of emaciated _horse_ and sickly humanoid, with slimy, transparent skin and long, stringy hair. Its face is long and equine, with a mouth filled with jagged teeth. Few, however, ever see a _kelpie_ in its _[[spells/True Form|true form]]_, for kelpies almost always encounter other creatures while in disguise as a humanoid, _horse_, or _hippocampus_, reverting to their _true form_ only after their targets have drowned so that they can feast on their victims, leaving behind only the heart and liver (as both of these organs are distasteful to most kelpies).

Kelpies can be found in saltwater and freshwater environments, including fens, rivers, swamps, and underground pools and lakes. Communities living near _kelpie_ lairs believe that folk who die on the water or are killed by a _kelpie_ become kelpies themselves. Kelpies may serve as steeds for aquatic fey or other water monsters while in their _hippocampus_ forms, sometimes without their riders ever knowing the truth of the steed’s sinister nature.

A typical _kelpie_ is 6 feet tall and weighs 170 pounds.
