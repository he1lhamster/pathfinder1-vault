  Conductive (Ex): Anytime a tophet is affected by an effect that deals fire damage,
    determine how much damage the construct would have taken if it were not immune
    to fire. Creatures currently swallowed whole by the construct take fire damage
    equal to half of this amount.
  Swallow Whole (Ex): Once swallowed by a tophet, an opponent takes no damage, but
    is trapped inside the creature's hollow interior. The construct's maw locks down,
    preventing creatures from climbing back out. A creature can attempt to hack or
    smash its way out as normal, but a tophet's stomach has hit points equal to one-tenth
    its actual hit points plus its bonus hit points for being a construct (totalling
    40 hit points for most tophets). Alternatively, a swallowed creature can attempt
    to pick the lock on the iron hatch in the tophet's stomach by making a DC 30 Disable
    Device check. If a creature exits by picking the lock, the tophet closes its hatch
    and can swallow whole again. These locks can also be picked from the outside,
    but only after the tophet is slain. A Large tophet's belly can hold 1 Medium creature
    at a time.
desc_long: |-
  Known in some lands as furnace guards or iron gluttons, tophets have long served in the palaces and prisons of tyrants as vigilant sentinels and dreaded punishments. Appearing as rotund iron statues, often bearing the caricatured visages of past kings or dishonored nobles, these constructs all possess yawning maws, capable of easily gobbling up smaller creatures. Upon consuming a victim, the animate statue becomes a walking prison, holding its victim within with little chance for escape. The iron statue can then return its victim to the proper cell, the feet of its lord, or any other fate its creator determines. In the most feared case, tophets capture or are fed prisoners, then wander out into the desert heat or even rivers of molten rock, where their interiors attain hellish temperatures, torturing and often outright killing those trapped within.

  Tophets are often assembled in groups of up to a dozen, where cruel rulers incarcerate traitors and other criminals. Mindless creatures capable only of obeying their masters' whims, these unthinking constructs make incorruptible guardians and are endlessly loyal.

  Tophets stand 10 feet tall and weigh 3,000 pounds.

The construct’s maw locks down, preventing creatures from climbing back out.

If a creature exits by picking the lock, the _tophet_ closes its hatch and can _swallow whole_ again. These locks can also be picked from the outside, but only after the _tophet_ is slain. A Large _tophet_’s belly can hold 1 Medium creature at a time.

##### Description

Known in some lands as furnace guards or iron gluttons, tophets have long served in the palaces and prisons of tyrants as _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Vigilant|vigilant]]_ sentinels and dreaded punishments. Appearing as rotund iron statues, often bearing the caricatured visages of past kings or dishonored nobles, these constructs all possess yawning maws, capable of easily gobbling up smaller creatures. Upon consuming a victim, the animate _[[spells/Statue|statue]]_ becomes a walking prison, holding its victim within with little chance for escape. The iron _statue_ can then return its victim to the proper cell, the feet of its lord, or any other fate its creator determines. In the most feared case, tophets capture or are fed prisoners, then wander out into the desert _[[universal monster rules/Heat|heat]]_ or even rivers of molten rock, where their interiors attain hellish temperatures, torturing and often outright killing those trapped within.

Tophets are often assembled in groups of up to a dozen, where _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_ rulers incarcerate traitors and other criminals. Mindless creatures capable only of obeying their masters’ whims, these unthinking constructs make incorruptible guardians and are endlessly loyal.

Tophets stand 10 feet tall and weigh 3,000 pounds.
