### Special Abilities

**Aging Touch (Su)** As a standard action, a maharishi manu in

either corporeal or _[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ form can make a touch attack

against a living creature to wear down the creature’s body

with age, dealing 12d10 points of damage and stunning the

creature for 1 round. Creatures immune to magical aging are

immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses

all forms of _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_. A successful DC 26 Fortitude

save halves the damage and negates the stun effect. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

**Evolutionary Sentinel (Su)** A maharishi manu gains a +4 bonus

on saves to resist the effects of a _dismissal_ spell or similar

effect while visiting the world it is currently supervising.

**Timeless (Ex)** A maharishi manu oversees vast periods of

evolution without impediment. It is unaffected by magical

aging effects and spells that manipulate time. Whenever a

creature under the effect of _[[spells/Time Stop|time stop]]_ (or a similar effect)

comes within 1 mile of a maharishi manu, the maharishi

manu instantly gains the ability to act normally during

the remaining duration of the effect, allowing the two

creatures to interact.

##### Description

Serene, introspective, and simultaneously

old and timeless, a maharishi manu often

sits in quiet contemplation, speaking

only rarely and acting only when it must.

When it does communicate, it tends

to do so telepathically, and phrases its

advice and commands as strange riddles

that seem nonsensical at first, but grow

increasingly meaningful as listeners

overcome struggles and grow

on their own.

Maharishi manus are at

the pinnacle of the manu caste

of manasaputras, leading the

hierarchy by following directions

set by the kumaras and the Logos at the

center of the Positive Energy Plane. These

outsiders govern the spiritual development

over vast epochs, teaching lesser manus

and guiding all mortal incarnations

toward a sense of perfect enlightenment.

Because of the nature of their missions,

maharishi manus form strong bonds with

the inhabitants of the planets under their

care and are never kept away for long before

returning to those worlds should they be

banished by malicious forces.
