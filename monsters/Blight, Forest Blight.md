### Special Abilities

**Lignification (Su)** A creature struck by a forest _blight_’s claw must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Dexterity drain as its flesh transforms into increasingly immobile wood and plant matter. A creature whose Dexterity score is reduced to 0 by this ability is permanently turned into an ordinary tree. This effect ends (but does not restore drained Dexterity) if removed via a spell like _[[spells/Break Enchantment|break enchantment]]_ or _[[spells/Remove Curse|remove curse]]_, or if the forest _blight_ is slain. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Living Forest (Su)** Non-creature plants within a forest _blight_’s cursed domain twist to clutch at intruders. All creatures treat a forest _blight_’s cursed domain as difficult terrain as a result. Any creature trying to manipulate, control, or interact with the plants of this domain (including those using spells like _command plants_, _[[spells/Entangle|entangle]]_, and _[[spells/Transport via Plants|transport via plants]]_) must succeed at a DC 25 caster level check or the attempt fails. The forest _blight_ ignores these penalties, and as a free action can designate other creatures that can also ignore these penalties. All plant creatures in a forest _blight_’s cursed domain gain _fast healing_ 5; plant creatures that already cursed domain gain _fast healing_ 5; plant

creatures that already have _fast healing_ increase their fast

healing rate by 5.

##### Description

Forest blights’ constant urges to seek out and destroy civilization drive them toward isolated lumber camps, wilderness trade routes, and forest settlements. Forest blights are particularly fond of _[[spells/Sending|sending]]_ plant monsters to do their bidding, and their innate _[[feats/Cruelty|cruelty]]_ often compels them to allow one or two survivors to escape their clutches to act as a lure, drawing perspective heroes to attempt foolish acts of _[[spells/Retribution|retribution]]_ against the powerful and egotistical oozes. Forest blights are always eager to add new would-be saviors to their collections of transformed trees, after all.

A forest _blight_ is 7 feet across and weighs 350 pounds.
