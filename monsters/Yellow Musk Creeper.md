  Create Yellow Musk Zombie (Su): As a full-round action, a yellow musk creeper can
    bore dozens of tendrils into the brain of a helpless creature within reach, such
    as a creature entranced by its pollen. This attack inflicts 1d4 points of Intelligence
    damage per round. When a creature is reduced to 0 Intelligence, it dies, and the
    tendrils break off inside its brain. One hour later, the creature animates as
    a yellow musk zombie (see below).
  Pollen Spray (Ex): As a standard action, a yellow musk creeper can spray a cloud
    of pollen at a single creature within 30 feet. It must make a +4 ranged touch
    attack to strike the target, who must then succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be
    entranced for 1d6 rounds. An entranced creature can take no action other than
    to move at its normal speed into a space within the yellow musk creeper's reach,
    at which point an entranced creature remains motionless and allows the creeper
    to insert tendrils into its brain. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: The yellow musk creeper is a hideous plant that grows in haunted graveyards,
  grisly battlefields, and other places where death hangs heavy in the air and thick
  in the soil. The yellow musk creeper's method of procreation is singularly frightful-it
  slays the living, infests them with its seeds and pollen, then animates them as
  zombies. These zombies serve the plant as a guardian for several days, but when
  new zombies are created, older ones wander off into the surrounding wild, collapsing
  and breaking apart within 2d6 days to give seed to a new yellow musk creeper.

##### Description

The _yellow musk creeper_ is a hideous plant that grows in haunted graveyards, grisly battlefields, and other places where death hangs heavy in the air and thick in the soil.
