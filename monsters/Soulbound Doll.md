    animate another doll, using the same cost as creating a new construct. Once bound

    20.

  These small, sentient dolls contain a fragment of another creature's soul. The binding process strips most of the individuality from the soul, making a new soulbound doll an almost blank slate. Despite this process, fragments of the original creature's personality remain.

  Soulbound dolls can serve as companions, surrogate children, servants, guards, and sentries, as desired by their creators. Creators of soulbound dolls typically take care to take soul fragments from people whose personality traits the crafters wish to see in their dolls.

##### Description

These small, sentient dolls contain a fragment of another creature’s soul. The _[[spells/Binding|binding]]_ process strips most of the individuality from the soul, making a new _soulbound doll_ an almost blank slate. Despite this process, fragments of the original creature’s personality remain.

Soulbound dolls can serve as companions, surrogate children, servants, guards, and sentries, as desired by their creators. Creators of soulbound dolls typically take care to take soul fragments from people whose personality traits the crafters _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ to see in their dolls.
