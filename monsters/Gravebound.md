special_abilities:
  Bury Alive (Su): As a full-round action, a gravebound can manipulate the ground
    to fill in a pit that it created with its gravedigger ability. Any creature the
    gravedigger buries alive is trapped and can't move, and begins to suffocate. Creatures
    outside of the pit can dig out the buried creature. Each 5-foot cube of dirt weighs
    3,000 pounds, and a creature can move 5 times her maximum load worth of dirt per
    minute, or 10 times her maximum load if she has a shovel or other appropriate
    tool. Once all squares of dirt above a creature's head have been removed, the
    creature can breathe, and can escape with a DC 15 Strength or Escape Artist check.
    A standing Medium creature typically has its head buried under 5 feet of earth
    (3,000 pounds). For a Small creature, this is increased to roughly 7 feet of earth
    (4,200 pounds). If the creature was prone when it was buried, its head is buried
    under the full 10 feet of earth (6,000 pounds).
  Disease (Su): 'False Death: Injury; save Fort DC 15; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day;
    effect 1d4 Cha damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Charisma-based.
    A creature whose Charisma score is reduced to 0 by false death falls into a deep
    coma and appears to be dead to anyone who doesn't succeed at a DC 25 Heal check.
    After one week, the affected creature wakes up with all of its Charisma restored.'
  Gravedigger (Su): As a standard action, a gravebound can open up a 10-foot-deep
    pit in the earth underneath a single creature. The creature can avoid falling
    into the pit with a successful DC 17 Reflex save. Because the pit is made of soft
    earth, the falling damage the creature takes is nonlethal damage. The save DC
    is Charisma-based.
  Tied to the Grave (Ex): A gravebound can't venture more than 1,000 feet from the
    spot where its body is buried.
  Vulnerable to Consecration (Ex): Whenever a gravebound is within the area of a consecrate
    effect, it must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save at the beginning of each of
    its turns or be staggered for 1 round.
desc_long: Gravebound are hateful creatures formed when the souls of people who were
  buried alive return, animating grave dirt to form new bodies. Obsessed with their
  own deaths, gravebound can't travel far from their resting places, but they seethe
  with the need to inflict their fate upon others. A gravebound digs graves and attempts
  to bury victims alive in them, and wounds taken at its hands can cause a victim
  to appear to be dead. Each gravebound arises with a shovel attached to its back-a
  mark of its obsession- and those who slay a gravebound can take the shovel to assist
  buried allies before they suffocate.
