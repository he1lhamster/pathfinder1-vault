# Sceazir
This winged, six-legged creature seems to be constructed of dark

crystal. Its mouth is disproportionately large for its wolfish head,

gaping open to display rows of jagged teeth, and its spiky, manyjointed

legs bend in unsettling ways.

### Special Abilities

**Bond of the Void (Su)** Sceazirs have an innate connection

with sceaduinars and can intuitively understand their

commands. A _[[monsters/Sceazir|sceazir]]_ with a _sceaduinar_ rider forms

a telepathic connection with the rider, allowing the

_sceaduinar_ to control its _sceazir_ _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_ as a free action.

A _sceazir_ follows the commands of a _sceaduinar_ rider to

the best of its ability, but it almost never allows any other

creature to use it as a _mount_.

**Entropic Ruin (Ex)** When a _sceazir_ is slain, its body explodes in a

burst of negative energy. All creatures within a 20-foot burst

take 8d6 points of negative energy damage and become

_[[conditions/Fatigued|fatigued]]_. A creature can halve this damage and negate the

fatigue with a successful DC 20 Reflex save. If a creature was

already _fatigued_ when it fails this save, it becomes _[[conditions/Exhausted|exhausted]]_

instead. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Voidfury (Ex)** Sceazirs have an instinctive loathing for positive

energy. When targeted with positive energy (such as a cure

spell or channeled energy), a _sceazir_ immediately flies into

a fury, as the _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ spell, for 2d6 rounds.

##### Description

_[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|Vicious]]_ and brutal predators, sceazirs are born from

the substance of the Negative Energy Plane in much the

same way as the plane’s more intelligent inhabitants,

sceaduinars. Though they possess only an animalistic

intelligence, sceazirs loathe all forms of life and unlife

and are quick to hunt down anything they detect in their

territory that is not native to the Negative Energy Plane.

They are unnaturally fast, moving with equal ease on the

ground or through the air. Due to sceazirs’ speed and

skill at tracking, sceaduinars often use them as mounts or

beasts of burden. Sceazirs can understand the commands

of a _sceaduinar_ rider through a _[[spells/Telepathic Bond|telepathic bond]]_ and carry

out such commands obediently, but they almost never

accept non-sceaduinar riders.

A _sceazir_ is typically 11 feet long, stands 6 feet tall at the

shoulder, and weighs about 900 pounds.
