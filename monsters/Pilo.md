    takes 1d6 points of piercing damage. A creature that grapples a pilo takes 2d6
    points of piercing damage each round it is engaged in a grapple. A pilo can also
    use its quills to damage any opponent it successfully bull rushes. Any creature
    that takes damage from a pilo's quills risks being poisoned.
  Roll Up (Ex): As a move action, a pilo can tuck itself into a ball. This grants
    the pilo a +4 bonus to its natural armor, but its speed is reduced to 10 feet.
desc_long: These carnivorous marsupials, sometimes called tumblespikes, are irritable
  desert-dwelling creatures that even predators leave alone. They are aggressive and
  often attack creatures that are larger than themselves. Pilos plow toward their
  foes and attempt to gore these foes with their spikes, bellowing a wheezing series
  of grunts. When provoked by a creature much larger than themselves or a particularly
  dangerous predator, pilos roll up into a spiny ball to deter attacks. Their aggressive
  nature means that they often fight until they die or until their opponent perishes
  or flees. Though pilos are only 3 feet long, their muscular bodies and spikes-which
  constantly grow-contribute to their 80-pound weight. Like many marsupials, pilos
  carry their young in a pouch, which they protect by remaining rolled up except when
  hunting.

##### Description

These carnivorous marsupials, sometimes _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ tumblespikes, are irritable desert-dwelling creatures that even predators leave alone. They are aggressive and often attack creatures that are larger than themselves. Pilos plow toward their foes and attempt to gore these foes with their spikes, bellowing a wheezing series of grunts. When provoked by a creature much larger than themselves or a particularly dangerous predator, pilos roll up into a spiny ball to deter attacks. Their aggressive nature means that they often fight until they die or until their opponent perishes or flees. Though pilos are only 3 feet long, their muscular bodies and spikes—which constantly grow—contribute to their 80-pound weight. Like many marsupials, pilos carry their young in a pouch, which they protect by remaining rolled up except when hunting.
