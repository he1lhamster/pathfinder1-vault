  Blessed Aspect (Su): |-
    A kuribu has four true holy countenances, three of which are hidden at any time. As a swift action, the kuribu can present a different countenance and gain its benefits, losing the benefits of the countenance the angel has just hidden.

    Eagle: The kuribu's face and voice become more birdlike. Once every 1d4 rounds, the kuribu can let out an ear-piercing screech as a standard action. All creatures in a 15-foot cone take 1d6 points of sonic damage (Fortitude DC 13 half). Creatures with 4 Hit Dice or fewer that fail their saving throws are dazed for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

    Human: The kuribu's face becomes like a mask, and the angel gains the freeze extraordinary ability, allowing the kuribu to take 20 on Stealth checks to hide in plain sight as a marble statue of a kuribu. The kuribu can appear as a statue indefinitely. Most kuribus first present this face when dealing with mortals, changing to one of their other faces only if combat begins.

    Lion: The kuribu develops a fearsome set of jaws capable of making bite attacks. This is a primary natural attack (with a +5 attack bonus) that deals 1d4 points of damage.

    Ox: The kuribu's face grows sterner and body grows sturdier. The angel gains a +4 resistance bonus on Fortitude saving throws and a +4 to CMD against bull rush and trip combat maneuvers.
  Lesser Protective Aura (Su): A kuribu has a lesser form of the protective aura possessed
    by more powerful angels. This protective aura grants the kuribu a +2 deflection
    bonus to AC against evil foes, and a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws
    made against evil effects or spells cast by evil creatures (this does not stack
    with the resistance bonus from the kuribu's ox countenance). This aura extends
    to a radius of 5 feet, but can benefit only two additional creatures other than
    the kuribu at any one time. A kuribu's protective aura is fragile, and as soon
    as an evil creature successfully strikes the angel, or as soon as the kuribu fails
    a saving throw against an evil source, the protective aura fades away and is no
    longer applicable. The kuribu can reactivate the protective aura by spending 1
    minute concentrating upon the task.
desc_long: |-
  Though one of the least powerful kinds of angels, kuribus are trusted with the protection of sacred places such as churches and blessed bowers. Their ability to stay as still as statues allows them to stand sentinel over their charges for decades, or even centuries. When their guarded locations are invaded, kuribus take flight and pepper their foes with arrows, altering their countenances as the situation requires. If outmatched or outnumbered, the majority of a flight of kuribus sacrifice themselves, while a lone kuribu retreats to fetch reinforcements, be it angels from a higher choir or a nearby hero.

  Kuribus look like small, round-cheeked humanoids, and have pale, flawless skin that is actually as tough as stone. This both aids them in disguising themselves as statues and affords them protection. Their child-like forms lend them an air of purity and innocence. A kuribu has two sets of wings, with the smaller pair at the base of the spine allowing a greater amount of control when flying. A typical kuribu stands 3 feet tall but weighs 60 pounds as a result of the angel's dense, stonelike flesh.

### Special Abilities

**_Blessed_ Aspect (Su)** A kuribu has four true holy countenances, three of which are hidden at any time. As a swift action, the kuribu can present a different countenance and gain its benefits, losing the benefits of the countenance the angel has just hidden.

_[[monsters/Eagle|Eagle]]_: The kuribu’s face and voice become more birdlike. Once every 1d4 rounds, the kuribu can let out an ear-piercing _[[spells/Screech|screech]]_ as a standard action. All creatures in a 15-foot cone take 1d6 points of sonic damage (Fortitude DC 13 half). Creatures with 4 Hit Dice or fewer that fail their saving throws are _[[conditions/Dazed|dazed]]_ for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Human: The kuribu’s face becomes like a _[[items/Mundane/Mask|mask]]_, and the angel gains the _[[universal monster rules/Freeze|freeze]]_ extraordinary ability, allowing the kuribu to take 20 on Stealth checks to hide in plain sight as a marble _[[spells/Statue|statue]]_ of a kuribu. The kuribu can appear as a _statue_ indefinitely. Most kuribus first present this face when dealing with mortals, changing to one of their other faces only if combat begins.

_[[monsters/Lion|Lion]]_: The kuribu develops a fearsome set of jaws capable of making bite attacks. This is a primary natural attack (with a +5 attack bonus) that deals 1d4 points of damage.

Ox: The kuribu’s face grows sterner and body grows sturdier. The angel gains a +4 _resistance_ bonus on Fortitude saving throws and a +4 to CMD against bull rush and _[[universal monster rules/Trip|trip]]_ combat maneuvers.

**Lesser Protective Aura (Su)** A kuribu has a lesser form of the protective aura possessed by more powerful angels. This protective aura grants the kuribu a +2 deflection bonus to AC against evil foes, and a +2 _resistance_ bonus on all saving throws made against evil effects or spells cast by evil creatures (this does not stack with the _resistance_ bonus from the kuribu’s ox countenance). This aura extends to a radius of 5 feet, but can benefit only two additional creatures other than the kuribu at any one time. A kuribu’s protective aura is fragile, and as soon as an evil creature successfully strikes the angel, or as soon as the kuribu fails a saving throw against an evil source, the protective aura fades away and is no longer applicable. The kuribu can reactivate the protective aura by spending 1 minute concentrating upon the task.

##### Description

Though one of the least powerful kinds of angels, kuribus are trusted with the protection of _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sacred|sacred]]_ places such as churches and _blessed_ bowers. Their ability to stay as still as statues allows them to stand sentinel over their charges for decades, or even centuries. When their guarded locations are invaded, kuribus take _flight_ and pepper their foes with arrows, altering their countenances as the situation requires. If outmatched or outnumbered, the majority of a _flight_ of kuribus _[[spells/Sacrifice|sacrifice]]_ themselves, while a lone kuribu retreats to fetch reinforcements, be it angels from a higher choir or a nearby hero.

Kuribus look like small, round-cheeked humanoids, and have pale, flawless skin that is actually as tough as stone. This both aids them in disguising themselves as statues and affords them protection. Their child-like forms lend them an air of purity and _[[spells/Innocence|innocence]]_. A kuribu has two sets of wings, with the smaller pair at the base of the spine allowing a greater amount of control when flying. A typical kuribu stands 3 feet tall but weighs 60 pounds as a result of the angel’s dense, stonelike flesh.
