  Power Dive (Ex): A flying mythic griffon can move up to four times its speed when
    it charges. If its charge begins 40 or more feet above its target, its first attack
    deals double damage. It must be flying downward at an angle of 45 degrees or steeper
    to use this ability.
desc_long: |-
  A mythic griffon is a superior specimen-perhaps augmented by magic, blessed by a nature goddess, or the descendant of an exceptional line of mighty griffons dating back to the first of its kind. Stronger and faster than other griffons, it is aware of its superiority (even though it is no more intelligent than a non-mythic griffon) and will only consent to a truly heroic rider who respects it as an equal rather than as a mere steed.

  If approached by a suitable rider, a mythic griffon is no more difficult to train than a non-mythic griffon. The eggs of a mythic griffon usually sell for twice as much as those of a common griffon, though there is no way to tell if a particular hatchling is mythic until it is several weeks or months old. Mythic griffons are extremely protective of their mates, eggs, and offspring, and may spend the rest of their lives in the search for vengeance against thieves or murderers- even working with lesser beings as allies or riders.

  A mythic griffon who cannot find a suitable griffon mate may consort with unicorns, awakened horses, or mythic horses or unicorns. The offspring of such unions is usually a hippogriff (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 156), but in rare cases is a mythic hippogriff. Because of prejudice against a hippogriff's animal-level intelligence, a mythic griffon usually leaves its offspring once they are grown.

  A mythic griffon can carry up to 400 pounds as a light load, 800 pounds as a medium load, and 1,200 pounds as a heavy load.

##### Description

Griffons are powerful aerial predators, swooping down from their high aeries to take their prey with beak and talon. Aggressive and territorial, they are no mere beasts, but rather calculating combatants and loyal companions to those who earn their respect, fighting to the death to protect their friends and kin.

Weighing in at over 500 pounds and measuring 8 feet long from hooked beak to tufted tail, the _[[monsters/Griffon|griffon]]_ strikes an imposing silhouette that has long been used in heraldry and other iconography as a symbol of power, authority, and justice. In reality, the _griffon_ is less concerned with abstract concepts than with hunting food and protecting its own. While they can sometimes be trained or befriended to serve as mounts, griffons have no inherent affinity for humanoids, and frequently come into bloody conflict with civilized races over their attempts to secure their favorite food—_[[monsters/Horse|horse]]_ flesh. City folk may marvel at the trained _griffon_’s stately manner and 25-foot wingspan, but those farmers forced to share territory with its wild kin know to hurry home and secure their barns when the beasts’ hunting shrieks _[[universal monster rules/Split|split]]_ the sky.

Griffons mate for life, and will often search for years to take _[[feats/Vengeance|vengeance]]_ over a slain mate or child. It was likely this innate stubbornness and fierce loyalty that first brought them into domestic use as mounts and guardians of treasure hoards. Despite the inherent danger, trade in captured griffons and stolen eggs is brisk, with their eggs worth up to 3,500 gp apiece and live young twice that. Characters eager for _griffon_ mounts, however, should note that buying or forcibly domesticating intelligent creatures like griffons is still recognized as slavery by most good deities, and winning a _griffon_’s allegiance of its own free will is no easy task. Reaching a mutually agreeable accord (or even a friendship) is a much more elegant and safe route to securing a _griffon_ _[[spells/Mount|mount]]_.

Before it can be ridden in combat, a _griffon_ requires practice bearing the weight of its rider. In order to be trained successfully, a _griffon_ must first be helpful toward its trainer (possibly requiring a Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Handle Animal check). After that, 6 weeks of practice and a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check is sufficient for the beast to be comfortable with its burden, and due to their intelligence, trained griffons can be treated as knowing every trick listed in the Handle Animal skill description, possibly even responding to new, simple requests made in Common.

Griffons can carry up to 300 pounds as a light load, 600 pounds as a medium load, and 900 pounds as a heavy load. Riding a _griffon_ requires an exotic saddle.
