### Special Abilities

**Devour Disease (Su)** As a standard action, a _[[monsters/Papinijuwari|papinijuwari]]_

can suck the life force out of a diseased creature within

30 feet as a ranged touch attack. An affected creature

must immediately succeed at a saving throw against one

disease affecting it or suffer that disease’s effect. This

saving throw does not count against the number of saves

required to cure the disease. If it fails the saving throw, the

_papinijuwari_ gains 30 temporary hit points.
**Sense Decay (Su)** A _papinijuwari_ is under the constant effects

of _[[spells/Deathwatch|deathwatch]]_, and can detect creatures currently

infected by disease as if by the _[[universal monster rules/Scent|scent]]_ ability.
**Shooting Star (Su)** As a full-round action

that provokes attacks of opportunity,

a _papinijuwari_ can fly at a speed of

300 feet. The _papinijuwari_ can use this ability only outside

at night, and must be at least 500 feet above the ground to

do so. It must also hold a lit _[[items/Mundane/Torch|torch]]_ while doing so; the _torch_

need not be magical, and while held by the _papinijuwari_, the

_torch_’s flame is not subject to mundane effects that would

extinguish it, such as the wind.

##### Description

Racing across the skies and preying on diseased humanoids

of all kinds, the merciless, cyclopean papinijuwaris are the

hated cousins of cloud giants. Even evil cloud giants regard

papinijuwaris with disdain, as their hunting practices

offend the more “refined” giants’ delicate sensibilities.

Papinijuwaris are agents of death and pestilence,

feeding off of the suffering they help to spread. In some

humanoid cultures, the sight of a shooting star heralds

the arrival of the dreaded papinijuwaris, who invisibly

stalk through settlements at night, hastening the

progression of diseases.

A full-grown _papinijuwari_ stands about 20 feet tall and

weighs nearly 6,000 pounds.
