# Devil, Chortov
Quivering with _[[universal monster rules/Heat|heat]]_ and barely restrained might, this monstrous, pig-faced titan looms taller than a city wall. Girded in fiendishly etched armor too small for its incredible corpulence, rolls of densely muscled hide spill forth in a flamered avalanche. Gnashing its many-tusked teeth and clutching a wicked military fork, the terrible giant rumbles as if preparing to roar or scream.

### Special Abilities

**Corrupt Fire (Su)** Any fire effect—naturally or magically created—within 50 feet of a chortov is tainted into hellfire by its fury and evil. Aside from being sinisterly colored, hellfire functions like normal fire, except that half the damage dealt by hellfire is fire damage and the other half results from evil energy and is therefore not subject to being reduced by _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ to fire-based attacks. In addition, all of a chortov’s _[[universal monster rules/Spell-Like Abilities|spell-like abilities]]_ with the fire subtype produce hellfire instead of normal fire.

**Hellfire Soul (Su)** Upon being reduced to 0 hit points, a chortov explodes in a blast of hellfire. All creatures within 25 feet take 6d6 points of damage from hellfire (see above; DC 22 Reflex save for half ). The save DC is Constitution-based. Upon exploding, the chortov’s waning yet still raging soul lingers on as a creature of pure living hellfire. This creature has the same statistics as a Huge fire elemental, except that damage caused by its _[[universal monster rules/Burn|burn]]_ ability results from hellfire and it is not vulnerable to cold. Every round that this hellfire elemental exists, it loses 10 hit points until it dissipates completely.

**Infernal Bondage (Su)** Chortovs wage Hell’s wars not by choice, but due to powerful magical bondage. The armor that binds all chortovs bears an infernal curse that compels these murderous fiends to serve the will of their infernal masters. This compulsion can be temporarily dismissed by a _[[spells/Break Enchantment|break enchantment]]_, _[[spells/Dispel Law|dispel law]]_, or _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ spell that overcomes a DC 25 dispel check. This frees the chortov of its bondage for 1d6 minutes, during which the baffled creature acts as though under the effects of the spell _[[spells/Confusion|confusion]]_. Destroying the armor via sundering attacks also frees the devil for 1d6 minutes, after which the armor magically reforms. A chortov’s armor has hardness 13 and 45 hit points.

**Wrath (Su)** The anger and hatred of chortovs is infectious. Any creature damaged by a weapon wielded by a chortov or a chortov’s slam attack must make a DC 17 or be thrown into a haze of murderous _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_, being treated as though under the effects of the spells _confusion_ and _rage_. This mania lasts for 1 minute, but victims may retry their save to resist every round. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

##### Description

Towering, rage-wracked brutes enslaved to the will of Hell, chortovs fume upon the borders and ramparts of Hell's hinterlands, murderous deterrents to any who would besiege the shores of the infernal realm or seek to escape. Born from the remains of souls not destined for Hell but _[[feats/Damned|damned]]_ nonetheless, chortovs carry with them the _rage_ of those who have suffered the multiverse’s cruelest injustice, and by the inescapable yoke of diabolical magic find themselves set upon the enemies of their merciless captors. Trapped within grotesque bodies of writhing, porcine flesh and smoldering hellfire, these horrors hate all things— other creatures, their fate, and the lords who have ensnared them and forced them to serve even past _[[spells/Damnation|damnation]]_.

Standing over 20 feet tall, chortovs are mountains of flesh, muscle, and flame. Each weighing upward of 5 tons, these devils bear plates and bands of diabolical armor that serve as physical manifestations of the infernal sorceries that bind them as eternal slaves to Hell. Each chortov’s armor is unique, often bearing images of the vaguely remembered torments their constituent souls once suffered. Their bodies, too, bear incongruities uncommon in other diabolical races, harkening toward the lawless natures of the soul-stuff from which these terrors are sculpted.
