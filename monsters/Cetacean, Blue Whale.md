  Hold Breath (Ex): A blue whale can hold its breath a number of rounds equal to 10

  Powerful Tail (Ex): A blue whale's massive tail deals more damage than a normal
    tail slap. The blue whale's tail slap is a primary attack and applies 1-1/2 times
    its Strength bonus to its tail slap damage.
  Stun (Ex): A blue whale's fluke can deliver a powerful stunning blow. A creature
    struck by this attack must succeed at a DC 34 Fortitude save or be dazed for 1
    round. If the strike is a critical hit and the target fails its save, it is instead
    stunned for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.
desc_long: The imposing blue whale is one of the largest animals in the sea, though
  it is generally docile toward anything it doesn't perceive as a threat. A filter-feeder,
  the blue whale does not look at humans or ships as potential meals, instead preferring
  to eat millions of tiny invertebrates known as krill, which it sucks through its
  baleen in massive gulps. The most dangerous thing about a blue whale, other than
  its sheer size, is its powerful tail, which can capsize boats and kill humanoids.
  These enormous mammals can be found in all of Golarion's oceans and seas. An adult
  blue whale is 100 feet long and weighs 200 tons.

##### Description

The imposing blue _whale_ is one of the largest animals in the sea, though it is generally docile toward anything it doesn’t perceive as a threat. A filter-feeder, the blue _whale_ does not look at humans or ships as potential meals, instead preferring to eat millions of tiny invertebrates known as krill, which it sucks through its baleen in massive gulps. The most dangerous thing about a blue _whale_, other than its sheer size, is its powerful tail, which can _capsize_ boats and kill humanoids. These enormous mammals can be found in all of Golarion’s oceans and seas. An adult blue _whale_ is 100 feet long and weighs 200 tons.
