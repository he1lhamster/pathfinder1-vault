  Curse of Oblivion (Su): Three times per day as a standard action, an abandoned one
    can cause one creature within 60 feet to disappear (Will DC 15 negates). Living
    creatures treat the victim as invisible and can't hear its voice. This is a curse
    effect and lasts for 12 hours or until the abandoned one is destroyed, whichever
    comes first. Only creatures that are within 100 feet of the target when the abandoned
    one uses this ability are unable to see and hear the target, and they remain unable
    to do so even if they go outside of this range. The target remains invisible for
    the entire duration, even if it attacks or takes other actions that would normally
    cause an invisible creature to become visible. It can speak and cast spells as
    normal, but only the abandoned one can hear its vocalizations. The target remains
    tangible, and can be detected by scent, touch, or the sound of its movement. The
    save DC is Charisma-based.
  Forgotten Friend (Su): When an abandoned one successfully uses its curse of oblivion,
    any creature within 100 feet of the cursed creature that has prior knowledge of
    it must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw or lose all memory of the target's
    existence for the duration of that ability's effect, and ignore or explain away
    all evidence of the target's existence. Whether or not it succeeds at the save,
    a creature can only be affected by this ability once per day. This is a mind-affecting
    compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Selective Invisibility (Sp): This ability functions as invisibility (CL 5th), but
    doesn't end when the abandoned one attacks a creature. Instead, any creature the
    abandoned one attacks can see through the abandoned one's invisibility for 1 hour.
desc_long: |-
  Abandoned ones are the vengeful remains of lost soldiers from the Taldan Armies of Exploration- soldiers who were left behind in the wild places of the world and forgotten as their armies moved on or retreated. Tethered to their own corpses by the fury of their perceived abandonment, abandoned ones seek to share their torment with any mortals they encounter.

  An abandoned one resembles its living self, but its features are drawn and its skin leathery. Abandoned ones approach travelers in the darkness, magically disguised as lost soldiers or obliging guides, then attempt to draw victims off alone and kill them before their companions remember them.

##### Description

Abandoned ones are the vengeful remains of lost soldiers from the Taldan Armies of Exploration— soldiers who were left behind in the wild places of the world and forgotten as their armies moved on or retreated. Tethered to their own corpses by the fury of their perceived abandonment, abandoned ones seek to share their torment with any mortals they encounter.

An _abandoned one_ resembles its living self, but its features are drawn and its skin leathery. Abandoned ones approach travelers in the _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_, magically disguised as lost soldiers or obliging guides, then attempt to draw victims off alone and kill them before their companions remember them.
