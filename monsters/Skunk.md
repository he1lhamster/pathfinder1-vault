  Musk (Ex): Up to twice per day, a skunk can spray a stream of noxious musk at a
    single target within 10 feet as a standard action. With a successful ranged touch
    attack, the creature struck by this spray must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or
    be nauseated for 1d4 rounds and then sickened for 1d4 minutes by the horrific
    stench. A successful save reduces the effect to only 1d4 rounds of being sickened.
    A creature cannot use the scent ability as long as it is affected by this musk.
    The save DC is Constitution-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus.
desc_long: These small mammals are well known to humanoids and forest creatures alike,
  with their distinctive black-and-white-striped markings and infamous scent glands.
  Creatures like big cats or wolves that normally would make a meal of such a small
  creature give skunks plenty of space, for they have learned well that the combination
  of black and white on a skunk's back equates to a hideously overpowering stench.

##### Description

These small mammals are well known to humanoids and forest creatures alike, with their distinctive black-and-white-striped markings and infamous _scent_ glands. Creatures like big cats or wolves that normally would make a meal of such a small creature give skunks plenty of space, for they have learned well that the combination of black and white on a _skunk_’s back equates to a hideously overpowering _stench_.
