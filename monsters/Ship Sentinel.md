##### Description

Ship sentinels are _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Animated|animated]]_ constructs that are bound to a specific vessel and to that ship’s captain. Crafted to resemble a humanoid figurehead, a _ship sentinel_ normally rests at the prow of its ship, granting good fortune and protection to the crew. But in times of dire need, the captain can also activate the _ship sentinel_, causing it to spring to life and fight alongside the vessel’s crew. Although individual features of ship sentinels may vary, all ship sentinels are made of wood and have the same general statistics.

A _ship sentinel_ stands roughly 6 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.
