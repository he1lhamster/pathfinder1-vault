  Electrified (Ex): A creature that strikes a capacitor ooze with a natural weapon,
    unarmed strike, or metal weapon takes 4d6 points of electricity damage. Creatures
    grappling a capacitor ooze take this damage when initiating the grapple and on
    each round the grapple is maintained.
  Neurophagic Jolt (Ex): 'When a capacitor ooze deals electricity damage to a target
    with its slam attack, the jolt to the target's neurological system stuns the creature
    for 1 round (Fortitude DC 25 negates). A second neurophagic jolt to a stunned
    target sets up a destructive resonance in the target's brain. This resonance functions
    like an affliction with the following statistics: save Will DC 25; frequency 1/round
    for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dexterity and 1d2 Intelligence damage; cure 1 save. Neutralize
    poison does not cure this affliction, but heal, greater restoration, and any effect
    that removes insanity does. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.'
  Osmotic Drain (Ex): A capacitor ooze drains power from nearby electrical sources.
    Any creatures within 10 feet of a capacitor ooze carrying at least one device
    that's powered by or generates electricity must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save
    or lose 1 charge from a random electrical device. Singleuse items are depowered
    entirely; devices with renewable electrical sources are depowered until they can
    recharge (in the case of a solar-powered device) or have their electrical function
    suppressed for 1d4 minutes (in the case of a shock weapon). A given power source
    can be drained only once per minute. For each electrical device affected by the
    capacitor ooze's osmotic drain, the ooze deals an additional 1d6 points of electricity
    damage the next time it would deal electricity damage to a target, and its speed
    increases by 30 feet for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

  Created by technologists seeking to devise an organic battery, capacitor oozes escaped captivity and now infest the hinterlands of Numeria. They find water dangerous and humidity painful, so they gravitate toward arid climes with stable weather.

  Capacitor oozes instinctively seek out sources of electricity, consuming them like other creatures would food. Maintaining vigor and growth requires regular consumption of organic material as well. A capacitor ooze that's denied power or food begins to starve.

  Capacitor oozes grow without bound, splitting only from damage or misfortune. Capacitor oozes that encounter others of their kind often merge if left undisturbed, a process that takes 1d4 hours and may result in a giant or advanced ooze. Capacitor oozes that aren't inclined to merge disperse, as they find disharmonious electrical auras intolerable.

### Special Abilities

**Electrified (Ex)** A creature that strikes a _[[monsters/Capacitor Ooze|capacitor ooze]]_ with a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or metal weapon takes 4d6 points of electricity damage. Creatures grappling a _capacitor ooze_ take this damage when initiating the grapple and on each round the grapple is maintained.

**Neurophagic _Jolt_ (Ex)** When a _capacitor ooze_ deals electricity damage to a target with its slam attack, the _jolt_ to the target’s neurological system stuns the creature for 1 round (Fortitude DC 25 negates). A second neurophagic _jolt_ to a _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_ target sets up a destructive resonance in the target’s brain. This resonance functions like an affliction with the following statistics: save Will DC 25; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dexterity and 1d2 Intelligence damage; cure 1 save. _[[spells/Neutralize Poison|Neutralize poison]]_ does not cure this affliction, but _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_, greater _[[spells/Restoration|restoration]]_, and any effect that removes _[[spells/Insanity|insanity]]_ does. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Osmotic Drain (Ex)** A _capacitor ooze_ drains power from nearby electrical sources. Any creatures within 10 feet of a _capacitor ooze_ carrying at least one device that’s powered by or generates electricity must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or lose 1 charge from a random electrical device. Singleuse items are depowered entirely; devices with renewable electrical sources are depowered until they can _[[spells/Recharge|recharge]]_ (in the case of a solar-powered device) or have their electrical function suppressed for 1d4 minutes (in the case of a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Shock|shock]]_ weapon). A given power source can be drained only once per minute. For each electrical device affected by the _capacitor ooze_’s osmotic drain, the ooze deals an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage the next time it would deal electricity damage to a target, and its speed increases by 30 feet for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

Created by technologists seeking to devise an organic battery, capacitor oozes escaped captivity and now infest the hinterlands of Numeria. They find water dangerous and humidity painful, so they gravitate toward arid climes with _[[conditions/Stable|stable]]_ weather.

Capacitor oozes instinctively seek out sources of electricity, consuming them like other creatures would food. Maintaining _[[spells/Vigor|vigor]]_ and growth requires regular _[[feats/Consumption|consumption]]_ of organic material as well. A _capacitor ooze_ that’s denied power or food begins to starve.

Capacitor oozes grow without bound, splitting only from damage or misfortune. Capacitor oozes that encounter others of their kind often merge if left undisturbed, a process that takes 1d4 hours and may result in a giant or advanced ooze. Capacitor oozes that aren’t inclined to merge disperse, as they find disharmonious electrical auras intolerable.
