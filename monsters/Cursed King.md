  Berserk (Ex): When a cursed king enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance

    the nearest living creature (or smashes some object smaller than itself if no
    creature is within reach). The undead's creator, if within 60 feet, can try to
    regain control by speaking firmly and persuasively to the creature with a successful
    DC 20 Charisma check.
  Bestial Curse (Su): When a cursed king is destroyed, it unleashes a final curse
    on all creatures within a 30-foot radius. This curse slowly robs the targets of
    their minds and bodies, eventually transforming them into animals of the same
    type as the animal head sewn to the cursed king's body. All creatures in the area
    must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage and 1d6
    points of Charisma damage. The Accursed creature doesn't benefit from effects
    that remove ability damage. Once cursed, the target must succeed at a Will save
    every 24 hours or take ability damage again. Once the target's Charisma or Wisdom
    score is reduced to 0, the victim is transformed into a mundane animal as per
    baleful polymorph, and is automatically treated as if it failed the second Will
    save to retain its mind. At this point, the creature receives the typical Wisdom
    and Charisma of that animal and stops taking ability damage. This is a curse effect,
    and the save DC is Charisma-based.
  Demanding Aura (Su): All creatures within a 30-foot radius that can see a cursed
    king must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be terrified into subservience. A creature
    that fails its saving throw gains the cowering condition for 1d4 rounds. A creature
    that successfully saves is not subject to the same cursed king's demanding aura
    for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: Pharaohs punish disloyal subjects in horrific ways, especially usurpers,
  rebel leaders, and false prophets who attempt to subvert the order of the nation
  and the loyalty of the ruler's other followers. After torture and decapitation,
  the rebels' souls are bound back into their mutilated bodies, transforming them
  into mummified mockeries of ambition and authority that exist for eternity in unliving
  agony.
