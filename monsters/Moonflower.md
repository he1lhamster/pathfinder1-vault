  Light Pulse (Su): As a standard action, a moonflower can release a pulse of bright
    light. All creatures within a 50-foot burst that can see the moonflower must make
    a DC 20 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. Moonflowers are immune to
    this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Pod Prison (Ex): This works like the swallow whole ability, except the moonflower
    can only use it once every 1d4 rounds, and the swallowed creature is immediately
    wrapped in a tight digestive cocoon and expelled into an adjacent square, where
    it takes damage every round (2d6 bludgeoning and 2d6 acid, AC 15, 25 hp). The
    cocooned target cannot use Escape Artist to get out of the cocoon. Other creatures
    can aid the target by attacking the cocoon with piercing or slashing weapons,
    but the creature within takes half the damage from any attack against the cocoon.
    Once the cocoon is destroyed, it deflates and decays. Each creature swallowed
    by a moonflower is encased in its own cocoon.
  Pod Spawn (Ex): Should a moonflower's pod prison kill and digest a Small or larger
    creature, the pod transforms into an adult moonflower with full hit points after
    1d4 hours. The newly formed moonflower has its own consciousness, but some aspect
    of its trunk or blossoms resembles the creature that died within. The dead creature's
    equipment remains inside the new moonflower and can be retrieved by killing it.
desc_long: |-
  A fully grown moonflower easily stands 20 feet tall, its massive trunk frequently 4 feet or more in diameter. The roots extend away from the base and into the soil, making the plant seem well anchored, but the roots themselves possess an agility that belies the great size of the plant and allows the moonflower to uproot itself and move with surprising speed. The tendrils of the plant are independently prehensile and writhe around the large flytrap-like “head” that crowns the stem.

  Moonflowers have never been known to communicate with other creatures, even with druids and others who regularly converse with plants. The plants do possess some manner of strange telepathy, though, and are in constant communication with their nearby brethren. Those who manage to intrude upon the creatures' alien thoughts face an assault of horrible visions of terrifying jungles filled with ancient, sentient, and malign plants.

The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Pod Prison (Ex)** This works like the _[[universal monster rules/Swallow Whole|swallow whole]]_ ability, except the _moonflower_ can only use it once every 1d4 rounds, and the swallowed creature is immediately wrapped in a tight digestive cocoon and expelled into an adjacent square, where it takes damage every round (2d6 bludgeoning and 2d6 acid, AC 15, 25 hp).

##### Description

A fully grown _moonflower_ easily stands 20 feet tall, its massive trunk frequently 4 feet or more in diameter. The roots extend away from the base and into the soil, making the plant seem well anchored, but the roots themselves possess an agility that belies the great size of the plant and allows the _moonflower_ to uproot itself and move with surprising speed. The tendrils of the plant are independently _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Prehensile|prehensile]]_ and writhe around the large flytrap-like “head” that crowns the stem.

Moonflowers have never been known to communicate with other creatures, even with druids and others who regularly converse with plants. The plants do possess some manner of strange _telepathy_, though, and are in constant communication with their nearby brethren. Those who manage to intrude upon the creatures’ alien thoughts face an assault of horrible visions of terrifying jungles filled with ancient, sentient, and malign plants.
