  Breath Weapon (Su): A vemerak's acidic breath weapon has no effect on inorganic
    or undead material. If the breath weapon deals damage to a living fleshy creature,
    the acid creates a transparent cloud of foul-smelling vapor that fills that creature's
    space and persists for 1 round. Any creature in or passing through the cloud must
    make a DC 24 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. This cloud is a poison
    effect. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  Earthquake (Su): As a full-round action, a vemerak can burrow its tentacles, legs,
    and mouth into the ground-this action does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
    At the start of the next round, it creates an effect identical to an earthquake
    spell (CL 17th). A vemerak can maintain this zone of trembling earth indefinitely,
    as long as it continues to take full-round actions to maintain the effect.
  Spore Cloud (Su): A unique form of magic-resistant mold grows upon the body of a
    vemerak. This mold is the source of the vemerak's spell resistance. When the vemerak
    moves, the mold exudes a cloud of spores in a 30-foot radius that acts as a targeted
    greater dispel magic (CL 17th) against the highest caster level magical effect
    the cloud touches as part of the vemerak's move that turn.
desc_long: |-
  Huge and otherworldly, the vemerak is a monster known as much for its disturbing appearance as its violent and cruel disposition.

  A vemerak is 10 feet tall and 20 feet long, its tentacle-like tails adding a further 15 feet to its length. It weighs just over 6 tons. Caverns that serve as lairs to these creatures invariably possess disturbing shrines where the creatures offer up portions of every meal to dark 

  gods that dwell deep below the sane world-as a result, many believe that vemeraks exist as the physical manifestation of the will of a particularly violent and insane deity.

**_Breath Weapon_ (Su)** A _[[monsters/Vemerak|vemerak]]_’s acidic _breath weapon_ has no effect on inorganic or undead material. If the _breath weapon_ deals damage to a living fleshy creature, the acid creates a transparent cloud of foul-smelling vapor that fills that creature’s space and persists for 1 round. Any creature in or passing through the cloud must make a DC 24 Fortitude save or be _[[conditions/Nauseated|nauseated]]_ for 1d4 rounds. This cloud is a poison effect. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

**_Earthquake_ (Su)** As a full-round action, a _vemerak_ can _burrow_ its tentacles, legs, and mouth into the ground—this action does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At the start of the next round, it creates an effect identical to an _earthquake_ spell (CL 17th). A _vemerak_ can maintain this zone of trembling earth indefinitely, as long as it continues to take full-round actions to maintain the effect.

##### Description

Huge and otherworldly, the _vemerak_ is a monster known as much for its disturbing appearance as its violent and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_ disposition.

A _vemerak_ is 10 feet tall and 20 feet long, its tentacle-like tails adding a further 15 feet to its length. It weighs just over 6 tons. Caverns that serve as lairs to these creatures invariably possess disturbing shrines where the creatures offer up portions of every meal to dark

gods that dwell deep below the sane world—as a result, many believe that vemeraks exist as the physical manifestation of the will of a particularly violent and insane deity.
