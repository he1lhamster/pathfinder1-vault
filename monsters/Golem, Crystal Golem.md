  Immunity to Magic (Ex): A crystal golem is immune to spells or spell-like abilities
    that allow spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against
    the creature, as noted below. A shatter spell damages a crystal golem as if it
    were a crystalline creature, and slows it (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds (no
    saving throw).A magical attack that deals fire damage ends any slow effect on
    the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack
    would otherwise deal.Any attempt at direct possession (such as the possession
    spell but not dominate monster) can affect a crystal golem. The golem does not
    resist these effects if they come from its creator or targets designated by its
    creator. Against all other attempts at intrusion, the golem receives a Will save
    at a +5 bonus.
  Psychic Amplification (Su): Each time a creature within 30 feet of a crystal golem
    uses a psychic spell or spell-like ability, the caster can choose to gain the
    benefit of either the Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Intuitive Spell, or Logical
    Spell metamagic feat without requiring a full-round action to cast. Only one such
    feat can be applied to a given casting. A crystal golem can use the spell-like
    abilities from its psychic magic as a swift action, and all its spell-like ability
    save DCs are Wisdom-based.
desc_long: Crystal golems cannot speak, instead emitting a constant hum of psychic
  energy. A crystal golem is 10 feet tall and weighs 1,800 pounds.
