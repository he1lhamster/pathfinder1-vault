  Collateral Damage (Su): Whenever an attack fails to damage a hobkins, whether due
    to the attack result being too low, a miss chance, or a failure to penetrate DR,
    the hobkins can redirect the attack to any target that was in range of the original
    attack (if any). The attack can't be redirected against the original attacker.
    The attacker rolls a new attack and damage roll against the new target, and is
    considered to possess the Improved Critical feat for the redirected attack. Hobkins
    delight in using this ability to force creatures to destroy their own prized possessions.
  Frightener (Ex): Intimidate is always a class skill for a hobkins, and it never
    takes a penalty on Intimidate checks due to being smaller than its target.
  Minor Levitation (Su): Hobkins generally float 1 inch above the ground. A hobkins
    can levitate up to 20 feet straight up as a move action, but at the end of the
    movement, unless it's found something to cling to, it returns to 1 inch above
    the nearest flat surface below.
  Out of Phase (Su): Hobkins are slightly out of phase with the Material Plane, causing
    all ranged attacks against them to suffer a 75% miss chance, including spells
    that require ranged touch attack rolls. Anything that prevents the blink spell
    also prevents this ability from functioning.
desc_long: |-
  Like many gremlins, hobkins enjoy destroying things that others cherish, but unlike their jinkin cousins, hobkins delight in manipulating people into destroying their own belongings. Their favorite strategy is to use their spell-like abilities and their Intimidate skill to frighten a family. A hobkins may wait at a child's window during a storm so that it appears pressed up against the glass when the lightning f lashes, only to hide away when they check again. Once its victims work themselves into a frenzy, the gremlin gives them time to arm themselves, then reveals itself, leaping and f loating out of reach to force panicked victims to throw anything at hand.

   A hobkins stands 3 feet tall and weighs 15 pounds.
