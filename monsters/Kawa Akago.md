##### Description

Kawa akagos are plants that were spiritually fertilized

by fragments of the restless spirits of drowned children,

becoming carnivorous creatures that inhabit marshes

and riversides. They resemble lily pads with a mouthlike

opening guarded by fibrous strands like those of a f lytrap

plant. A _kawa akago_’s gourdlike skin ranges from maroon

to crimson when it is well fed, but more often, creatures

encounter a _kawa akago_ when it is hungry. In this case, it

instead takes on the same hue as other lilypads in the area,

usually an innocuous green.

Carnivorous and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cunning|cunning]]_, kawa akagos hunt riverbanks

and waterways for both animals and travelers on which

to feed. Kawa akagos’ thorn-tipped fangs excrete a paininducing

_[[items/Weapon/Sap|sap]]_ that mimics the feeling of intense, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Burning|burning]]_

_[[universal monster rules/Heat|heat]]_. Though they prefer to fight in water, kawa akagos

usually ambush from land, using their dangerous _sap_

to drive would-be prey toward the nearby rivers or

streams that will soothe the painful

effects of their fangs. Once the

victim immerses itself, the

plant creatures swarm

their target if attacking

in numbers, or a single

plant strikes from the

depths to wear down the

victim. Although a kawa

akago has no respiratory

system, it’s body is rife

with pockets it can fill

with air and expel as

necessary. This network

of hollow chambers allows

the creature to speak on the rare

occasions it wishes to communicate, and is the

source of the creature’s terrible wail, which is capable of

_[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Breaking|breaking]]_ bones and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Shattering|shattering]]_ glass. The sound is often

described as similar to the simultaneous mournful cries

of a dozen children in serious distress.
