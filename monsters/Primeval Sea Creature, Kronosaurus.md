  A kronosaurus's diet consists of everything from large fish and sharks to small
  whales, giant squids, and sea turtles. Remains of other giant saurians have reportedly
  been found in the stomachs of those rare kronosauruses that are killed by hunters
  or wash up dead on shore. Unlike other reptiles, a kronosaurus does not lay eggs,
  but instead births its young live. The young kronosauruses stay with their mother
  for less than a year before parting ways and hunting on their own. A fully grown
  kronosaurus can reach lengths of up to 50 feet and weigh as much as 40,000 pounds.

##### Description

The mighty kronosaurus is a relentless _[[classes/Hunter|hunter]]_ that, once it picks up a potential meal’s _scent_, rarely stops seeking its prey until its appetite is sated. A kronosaurus’s diet consists of everything from large fish and sharks to small whales, giant squids, and sea turtles. Remains of other giant saurians have reportedly been found in the stomachs of those rare kronosauruses that are killed by hunters or wash up dead on shore. Unlike other reptiles, a kronosaurus does not lay eggs, but instead births its young live. The young kronosauruses stay with their mother for less than a year before parting ways and hunting on their own. A fully grown kronosaurus can reach lengths of up to 50 feet and weigh as much as 40,000 pounds.
