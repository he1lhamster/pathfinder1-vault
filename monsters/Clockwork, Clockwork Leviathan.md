    must hold its breath or risk drowning as long as it remains inside a clockwork
    leviathan's “stomach.”

  Clockwork leviathans are equally capable of functioning on land and in water.

  A clockwork leviathan's numerous metal plates and links are made of such resilient material that they never rust, even after long exposure to the briny sea waters that leviathans often patrol.

  Clockwork leviathans are 25 feet long and weigh just over 3 tons.

Clockwork leviathans are 25 feet long and weigh just over 3 tons.
