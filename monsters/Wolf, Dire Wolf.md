  wolves, but are much more aggressive. Dire wolves often serve giants as hunting
  companions and vicious guard animals. Some ferocious humanoids and woodsmen use
  trained dire wolves as mounts. Darker than normal wolves, dire wolves' coats tend
  toward blacks and deep mottled grays. An adult dire wolf is typically about 9 feet
  long and weighs roughly 800 pounds.
