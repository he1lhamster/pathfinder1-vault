  Crystal (Su): A wild hunt scout can manifest a green crystal in her free hand as
    a swift action; this crystal vanishes as soon as it leaves her possession. As
    a swift action, a wild hunt scout can fire a beam of green energy from her crystal.
    This is a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 40 feet that deals 3d6
    points of force damage on a hit. A creature struck by this beam must succeed at
    a DC 27 Fortitude save or be permanently blinded. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Force Scimitar (Su): As a swift action, a wild hunt scout can summon a crystalline
    scimitar. Attacks with this scimitar resolve as if they were touch attacks and
    deal force damage. Outside of its creator's hands, a force scimitar vanishes.
  Wild Hunt Link (Su): All creatures in a wild hunt scout's wild hunt link share each
    other's senses. As long as a creature benefits from this link, it gains a +4 insight
    bonus on initiative and Perception checks. If at least one creature in the link
    disbelieves an illusion, all creatures in the link are considered to disbelieve
    the illusion. Wild hunt fey in this link are never considered flat-footed against
    a foe unless all of them are considered flat-footed against that foe.
desc_long: Wild hunt scouts relish the chance to seek revenge upon those who have
  wronged or insulted the wild hunt. They grow bored quickly when the stakes are not
  lethal, yet they rarely let their bloodlust cloud their tactical choices.
