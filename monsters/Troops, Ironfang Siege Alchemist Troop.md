  Alchemical Bombardment (Ex): As a standard action, a siege alchemist troop can target
    up to 3 squares within 40 feet with a barrage of alchemical bombs. This attack
    deals 10d4 points of acid or fire damage (as selected by the troop) to all creatures
    in a 10-foot-radius burst (Reflex DC 26 half). A creature within the area of more
    than one burst must attempt separate saves against each. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  Alchemical Revitalization (Su): Three times per day as a swift action, this troop
    can grant itself fast healing 15 for 3 rounds.
  Firedrake Spout (Ex): As a standard action, the siege alchemist troop spews forth
    large gouts of fire from its incendiary siege engines. This attack takes the form
    of a 120-foot line or a 60-foot cone (as selected by the troop). Targets in the
    area take 20d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 26 half); those who fail their
    saves also catch on fire. A siege alchemist troop produces enough alchemical ammunition
    to use this ability 10 times each day. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
desc_long: Most members of this troop are supplied with chain shirts, longswords,
  and bandoliers of acid and alchemist's fire. As their creations are jury-rigged
  spontaneously, capturing a usable firedrake (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 163)
  after defeating one of these troops is rare.
