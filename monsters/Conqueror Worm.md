### Special Abilities

**Deific** Conqueror worms can grant divine spells to their worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on a _[[monsters/Conqueror Worm|conqueror worm]]_’s behalf. Conqueror worms grant access to the domains of Charm, Evil, Nobility, and Trickery, and their favored weapon varies but is always a simple weapon (daggers and sickles being the most common choices). Each _conqueror worm_ has its own unique holy symbol, although typically it resembles a ring of eyes.

**Mental Invader (Su)** A _conqueror worm_ infects the minds of others from afar, allowing it to control its puppets without leaving the safety of the earth’s depths. When a _conqueror worm_ communicates with a creature mentally, such as by using _telepathy_ or spells such as _dream_, it can attempt to form a lasting mental connection with that creature. The target can resist this connection with a successful DC 33 Will save. A target that succeeds at this save is immune to that _conqueror worm_’s mental invader ability forever. Once a connection is formed, the worm can communicate with the bonded creature using _telepathy_ over any distance, and can target the bonded creature with mind-affecting spells and effects regardless of range. A worm can form bonds with a number of creatures equal to its Intelligence modifier (10 for the typical _conqueror worm_). If a new bond would exceed this limit, the worm must choose to break one of its previous connections. The effects of a bond are suppressed while the worm and the bonded creature are on different planes. A bond can otherwise be _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ only via a _[[spells/Break Enchantment|break enchantment]]_, _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_, or _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ spell cast on the bonded creature, or by the worm’s death. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Telepathic Escape (Su)** A _conqueror worm_ can escape death by casting its mind out of its body at the moment of death. Up to once per day, when an attack, spell, or effect would reduce a _conqueror worm_ to 0 or fewer hit points or otherwise kill it instantly, it can transfer its mind to one of the creatures it has formed a connection with using its mental invader ability. The target can attempt a DC 33 Will save to resist being overtaken. If the target succeeds, the _conqueror worm_ can be killed normally. If the target fails, the _conqueror worm_ transfers its soul into the bonded creature’s body. This functions as the spell _possession_ (CL 21st) except the _possession_ is permanent. A host body possessed by a _conqueror worm_ in this way undergoes terrible changes to its physiology. Every day, the host must succeed at a DC 33 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Charisma drain. Over time, the host slowly grows more wormlike in appearance, losing body hair, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Growing|growing]]_ obese, and taking on a pale yellow-white coloration. When the host’s Charisma score is drained to 0, an ectoplasmic cocoon forms around the creature. Over the course of the next 24 hours, the host grows to an enormous size, and at the end of this time emerges in a _[[spells/Brand|brand]]_ new body as a new _conqueror worm_ that retains the memories of its previous incarnation, at which point the host creature is effectively dead (and can be resurrected normally). If the host is slain before this _[[spells/Transformation|transformation]]_ completes, the _conqueror worm_ dies as well. The effect can also be ended by any effect that successfully expels the _conqueror worm_’s possessing spirit from the host. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

##### Description

Though conqueror worms resemble immense vermin, those who mistake them for mindless creatures suffer terribly for their mistake. In truth, conqueror worms are creatures of vast intellect and equal depravity. These monstrous beings exist only to rule “lesser civilizations” from the shadows, and revel in the complete control of an unknowing society through the remote manipulation of its supposed leaders.

A _conqueror worm_ prefers to play with its toys before _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Breaking|breaking]]_ them. To do so, it burrows its way below a target nation’s capital. From there, the _conqueror worm_ makes mental contact with the city’s leaders, forming sinister _psychic_ connections with those in power. The worm beguiles some of these leaders with promises of wealth or power. Others, the worm controls outright using the considerable _[[universal monster rules/Psychic Magic|psychic magic]]_ at its disposal. Regardless, the end result is the same; without intervention, all end up as puppets _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Dancing|dancing]]_ to the _conqueror worm_’s whims.

Once a _conqueror worm_ seizes control of a city or nation, that region’s downfall can take years, if not decades—for conqueror worms are surprisingly theatrical. A _conqueror worm_ may direct a kingdom’s leader to enact _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_ or tyrannical laws, only to then use a second puppet to inflame the populace into revolt. Once the fires of revolution die down, the worm might then expose the rebel leader as a _[[npcs/Traitor|traitor]]_ or depraved criminal, causing the rebellion to turn on itself and descend again into violence. All the while, the _conqueror worm_ watches in delight at the madness, sin, and horror it inspires in others.

Eventually a _conqueror worm_ tires of its games, and plots to destroy its subjects. Often it does this by _[[spells/Sending|sending]]_ its puppets to war against a nearby nation. The horrors of war devastate not only the worm’s own populace, but also those of its neighbors, bringing perverse joy to the worm’s many hearts. However, a special fate awaits the worm’s favorite servants, who are brought down into its subterranean realm so they can glimpse their master’s _[[spells/True Form|true form]]_ before being impaled on the _conqueror worm_’s goreslick jaws. Its work finally finished, the _conqueror worm_ then seeks out a new realm to subjugate.

Perhaps the most terrifying and peculiar aspect of the _conqueror worm_ is its ability to form cults. Whether through accumulation of _psychic_ power or some hidden divine _[[spells/Spark|spark]]_, conqueror worms are capable of granting spells to creatures that worship them. A _conqueror worm_ exploits this ability to attract cultists, which it uses to further its goals in the civilized world above. Although such cults are absolutely loyal to the _conqueror worm_, which they worship as an all-knowing and all-powerful god, the _conqueror worm_ usually considers its mortal followers expendable.

A _conqueror worm_ is 80 feet long and weighs 70 tons.
