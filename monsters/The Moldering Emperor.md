is_3.5: true
desc_short: Viscous black ooze covers every inch of this writhing mass of flailing
  tendrils and vestigial appendages. Whatever it might have once been lies hidden
  beneath spatters of noxious, tar-like filth, which sprays across everything nearby
  it as the thing lashes and leaks madly. A wave of cold rushes before the disgusting
  abomination as it comes, an icy, fetid breath like that from a chill sepulcher.

special_abilities:
  Blood Rain (Su): Any creature within 15 feet of the Moldering Emperor takes 8 points
    of cold damage.
  Breath Weapon (Su): The Moldering Emperor has two breath attacks. One is a 50-foot
    cone of acid, once every 1d4 rounds, damage 14d10 acid, Reflex half DC 32. The
    other is a 30-foot cone of black blood, once every 1d4 rounds, damage 6d6 cold.
    Reflex DC 32.
  Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the Moldering Emperor must hit a creature
    with two tentacles. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without
    provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes
    a hold and can attempt to swallow the foe.
  Mind Thrust (Sp): The Moldering Emperor delivers a massive blast of mental energy
    at any one target within 60 feet, inflicting 15d10 points of damage. A successful
    DC 24 Will save negates the effect. This is a mind-affecting effect.
  Psychic Crush (Sp): The Moldering Emperor attempts to crush the mind of a single
    creature within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 24 Will save with a +4 bonus
    or collapse, becoming unconscious and dying at -1 hit points. If the target succeeds
    on the save, it takes 6d6 points of damage.
  Swallow Whole (Ex): The Moldering Emperor can try to swallow a grabbed opponent
    of a smaller size than itself by making a successful grapple check. Once inside,
    the opponent takes 2d8+15 points of crushing damage plus 2d6 points of acid damage
    per round from stomach secretions. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by
    using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the stomach
    (AC 22). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; any additional
    swallowed opponents must cut their own way out. The Moldering Emperor's interior
    can hold 1 Huge, 2 Large, 8 Medium, 32 Small, 128 Tiny, or 512 Diminutive or smaller
    opponents.
  Trace Teleport (Sp): This ability affects a spread with a 60-feet radius. The Moldering
    Emperor learns the mental coordinates of the teleport destination of all creatures
    that teleported in the area over the previous minute, gaining an awareness of
    the location equivalent to “seen casually.” This power does not grant any environmental
    information about the conditions of the destination.
  Skills: The Moldering Emperor has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform
    some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim
    check, even if distracted or endangered.
desc_long: Lurking amid the depths of the Caltherium at the heart of the Land of Black
  Blood writhes one of the vault's deadliest hunters, the fearsome Moldering Emperor.
  Once, perhaps, this monstrosity was an ancient neothelid, but centuries of exposure
  or experimentation with the black blood has perverted the beast into a terrible
  new form. Burdened with mutations, out-of-control tendrils, and wing-like fins,
  this hunter of the depths claims every black-bloodsoaked region of the vast cavern
  as its personal domain, and it doesn't take kindly to trespassers.

##### Description

Lurking amid the depths of the Caltherium at the heart of the Land of Black Blood writhes one of the vault’s deadliest hunters, the fearsome Moldering Emperor.
