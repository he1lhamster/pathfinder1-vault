  Bardic Performance (Su): A snapdragon leshy has the bardic performance ability of
    a 4th-level bard, granting it access to that ability's countersong, distraction,
    fascinate, inspire competence, and inspire courage aspects.
  Bloom Lasso (Ex): A snapdragon leshy can create and throw a tendril as a standard
    action. If it hits, this attack deals 1 point of damage (this damage is not modified
    by Strength) and affects the target with the leshy's crippling hysterics ability.
    This attack has a range increment of 20 feet and a maximum range of 100 feet.
  Crippling Hysterics (Ex): The snapdragon leshy's bloom lasso drapes the target in
    clinging blossoms that release intoxicating pollen. Any creature struck by the
    lasso must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or giggle uncontrollably
    for 1d4+1 rounds. This condition imposes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving
    throws, skill checks, and ability checks; while the effect lasts, the target must
    succeed at another DC 14 Fortitude saving throw at the end of its turn each round
    or fall prone in hysteria. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Greenspeaker (Su): A snapdragon leshy's bardic performances can affect plants as
    though they were not immune to mind-affecting effects. In addition, the bonuses
    granted to plants by the leshy's inspire competence and inspire courage increases
    by 1.
desc_long: Whereas most leshys are reclusive and content to quietly nurture the natural
  world, snapdragon leshys are consummate extroverts. They often find their way into
  settled areas, where they caper and gab at those around them. When their neighbors
  are slow to laugh, snapdragon leshys sometimes resort to juvenile pranks to elicit
  a reaction. These escalating exploits often prompt townsfolk to chase off the plant
  people, which the leshys are quick to forgive so long as nobody comes to harm.

##### Description

They often find their way into settled areas, where they caper and gab at those around them. When their neighbors are _[[spells/Slow|slow]]_ to laugh, snapdragon leshys sometimes resort to juvenile pranks to elicit a reaction. These escalating exploits often prompt townsfolk to chase off the plant people, which the leshys are quick to forgive so long as nobody comes to _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_.
