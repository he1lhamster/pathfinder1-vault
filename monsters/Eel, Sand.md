  Erupt (Ex): A sand eel that has buried itself in the sand can quickly erupt from
    the ground and attack. This counts as a charge, except the sand eel can only move
    its speed (not twice its speed), and it gains a +2 on its attack roll (in addition
    to the normal bonuses and penalties for charging).
  Sandwalking (Ex): Sand eels travel across sand, quicksand, gravel, and other areas
    with loose, small debris as if traversing normal ground rather than difficult
    terrain.
desc_long: |-
  Sand eels are unusual creatures native to Katapesh. They gain their name from the way they slither across the sand; unlike snakes, which must wriggle in wide S-shapes, sand eels slide along with the help of dozens of tiny feelers that sink into the sand and propel them forward, giving them a weirdly smooth movement.

  Sand eels measure 6 to 12 feet long and can weigh several hundred pounds. Their tiny bones and thin skins make them very light for their size.
