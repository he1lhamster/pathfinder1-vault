desc_long: |-
  Blackwisp egrets are relatively harmless during the day, but at night, their glowing eyes are often mistaken for the deadly will-o'-wisps that plague Belkzen's Ghostlight Marsh. Many people flee in terror upon seeing flocks of glowing orbs in the night and wind up twisting an ankle on a gnarled tree root or falling into a sinkhole as they bolt. These misfortunes have led many who travel through Ghostlight Marsh to consider blackwisp egrets unlucky omens.

  Blackwisp egrets are hunters and scavengers, living on anything from frogs to fish to carrion left by other denizens of the marsh. Their long, serrated beaks are excellent for cutting through the clothing of deceased travelers, and flocks of egrets on the edge of starvation sometimes even attack living travelers.

  Almost invisible at night thanks to their jet-black feathers, the birds are well adapted to hunting by stealth in their environment. They flock together for protection, as even the most dangerous predators avoid such groups when encountered in darkness, fearing that they may actually be a group of will-o'-wisps. The few swamp druids who still make their homes in the marsh have been known to domesticate these birds, encouraging them to slowly circle the druids' homes at night to ward away unwanted visitors.

##### Description

Blackwisp egrets are relatively harmless during the day, but at night, their glowing eyes are often mistaken for the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ will-o’-wisps that plague Belkzen’s Ghostlight Marsh. Many people flee in terror upon seeing flocks of glowing orbs in the night and wind up twisting an ankle on a gnarled tree _[[spells/Root|root]]_ or falling into a sinkhole as they bolt. These misfortunes have led many who travel through Ghostlight Marsh to consider blackwisp egrets unlucky omens.

Blackwisp egrets are hunters and scavengers, living on anything from frogs to fish to carrion left by other denizens of the marsh. Their long, serrated beaks are excellent for cutting through the clothing of deceased travelers, and flocks of egrets on the edge of starvation sometimes even attack living travelers.

Almost _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ at night thanks to their jet-black feathers, the birds are well adapted to hunting by stealth in their environment. They flock together for protection, as even the most dangerous predators avoid such groups when encountered in _darkness_, fearing that they may actually be a group of will-o’-wisps.
