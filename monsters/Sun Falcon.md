  Aura of Radiance (Su): A sun falcon radiates heat and light with the intensity of
    the noonday sun. Creatures within 10 feet of a sun falcon must succeed at a DC
    15 Fortitude save each round or become fatigued. A sun falcon can suppress or
    activate its aura at will as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Blinding Flash (Su): By spreading its wings wide, a sun falcon can blast an intense
    wave of heat and light in a 20-foot cone as a standard action. All creatures within
    this area must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or take 1d6 points of fire damage
    and be blinded for 1d4+1 rounds. Creatures that succeed at this save take no fire
    damage and are instead dazzled for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.

  Sun falcons are birds of omen in Osirion, with a reputation that goes back to the days of the nation's most ancient gods. In many myths and stories, sun falcons act as the eyes of many deities, though most commonly for Ra, who considers these birds to be among his holy creatures on Golarion. Sun falcons seem to watch over important people and oversee noteworthy events-sometimes from far enough away to be mistaken as a star visible during the day, sometimes from close enough to appear as a second sun. Today, the ancient gods are largely forgotten, but sun falcons still gravitate toward Osirion's heroes and pharaohs, suggesting that these abandoned gods are not so distant.

  A typical full-grown sun falcon weighs 2 to 3 pounds and measures 18 inches from beak to tail, with a wingspan approaching 5 feet.
