### Special Abilities

**Caustic Wit (Su)** Dispater is a master of urbane insults and flippant dismissals. He can attempt a Bluff check once per round as a free action in place of an Intimidate check to demoralize a foe within 30 feet. In addition to becoming _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_, a creature demoralized by Dispater is so filled with shame and self-loathing that it takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage and becomes _[[conditions/Dazed|dazed]]_. This additional effect can be negated with a successful DC 37 Will save. The insulted creature can attempt a new save each round at the beginning of its turn as a free action to end the effect, but any Charisma damage sustained remains until it is healed. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Lord of Iron (Ex)** Rust effects (such as _[[spells/Rusting Grasp|rusting grasp]]_) do not function within 60 feet of Dispater unless he allows them to function. Dispater can _command_ unintelligent iron cobras, iron golems, and any other construct made entirely out of iron as if he were the construct’s creator.

**Mortal _Gaze_ (Su)** Dispater can level his _gaze_ upon any one creature within 60 feet as a free action once per round. The creature he gazes upon gains 2 negative levels. Each of these negative levels requires a successful DC 37 Fortitude save to remove after 24 hours or it becomes permanent. Creatures slain by Dispater’s mortal _gaze_ rise again 1d4 rounds later as zombie lords (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 286) under Dispater’s control. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Voice of _Command_ (Su)** The saving throw DCs of Dispater’s _charm monster_ and _dominate person_ _spell-like abilities_ include a +2 bonus; this is included in the statistics above. Creatures do not gain the usual +5 bonus on saves against _charm monster_ if they are currently being threatened or attacked by Dispater or his allies. If Dispater commands a humanoid controlled via _dominate person_ to take an action against its nature, the creature does not gain a new saving throw to resist the effect unless the order is self-destructive, in which case the creature gains a new save with a +2 bonus to resist the _command_.

##### Description

Dispater is one of Asmodeus’s oldest and most loyal allies, with a favored place in the hierarchy of Hell. He generally keeps his distance from the machinations of the other archdevils, and of all their number he cares least about the tedious and trivial affairs of the Material Plane. His focus is on building the eternal and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Glorious|glorious]]_ perfection of Hell, the model community and system upon which the universe should be modeled. He is calm, creative, careful, and deliberate, in some ways the picture of a just sovereign, yet he is also unforgiving, ruthless, manipulative, and arrogant in the extreme. The rules of rank, station, and courtly life are his meat and drink, and he is swift to deride any who violate the tiniest rule of etiquette, though he quickly discards decorum when necessary to further his elaborate schemes. Alone among the archdevils, he maintains a passing acquaintance with courtly love and marriage, conferring with his advisors on matters of state.

Dispater is every inch the image of a devil, 13 feet tall with rippling, rust-colored muscles and a refined and majestic style, eschewing the opulent grandiosity of some of his brethren.
