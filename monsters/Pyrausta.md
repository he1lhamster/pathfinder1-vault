### Special Abilities

**Heart of Flame (Ex)** A tiny _spark_ of flame that acts as a

_[[monsters/Pyrausta|pyrausta]]_’s heart beats within its chest. Whenever a _pyrausta_

takes cold damage, including damage from environmental

cold, its little heart stalls. It loses its _fast healing_ and breath

weapon, gains the _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ condition, and takes 1 point

of damage each round. This continues until it is exposed to

a source of flame that would normally deal fire damage or

until it successfully uses its _spark_ spell-like ability to reignite

its heart (doing so requires a successful DC 11 concentration

check because of the ongoing damage).

##### Description

Though perhaps the smallest of dragons, pyraustas are not

insecure about their size, for they lack the inflated egos so

common among their larger kindred. Instead, pyraustas

delight in being what they are, and live in the here and now.

Though their natural life spans are similar to a human’s,

their dependence on flame to keep their hearts beating

means the average _pyrausta_ meets its end much sooner.

Some scholars believe that pyraustas, sometimes _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_

“insect dragons” or “true dragonflies,” are spawned from

the very hearts of volcanoes, where flickering flames are

common. In truth, young pyraustas are conceived in the

warmest months of the year, when swarms of the creatures

gather high in the night skies and perform elaborate

courtship rituals with their colorful flames, frolicking

playfully in mid-flight. These swarms are often mistaken

for fireflies, auroras, or other phenomena. A _pyrausta_’s

flame and its heart are one, and its fiery breath changes

color depending on the creature’s emotions. Pyraustas

use their inner flames primarily to express themselves,

creating vivid pyrotechnic displays to communicate their

feelings. They can also use this flame as a weapon if

necessary, but prefer not to.

A typical _pyrausta_’s body is 9 inches long, though its

wingspan is longer, and it weighs 1 to 2 pounds.
