### Special Abilities

**Abduct (Ex)** When a _[[monsters/Boggart|boggart]]_ hits a single target with both of its claw attacks as part of a full attack, it can attempt a drag combat maneuver as a free action. The _boggart_ can move more than 5 feet as part of this combat maneuver even if it doesn’t have any movement remaining for the round.

##### Description

Malicious and furtive, boggarts are believed to be brownies (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 49) that were mistreated or somehow corrupted. Unlike brownies, who sometimes form mutually beneficial relationships with particular families and take up residence within those families’ houses, boggarts rarely occupy homes. Instead, they lurk in swamps, in marshes, and on riverbanks, favoring areas where people have vanished or drowned. A _boggart_’s relationship with nearby households and homesteads is almost always _[[feats/Disruptive|disruptive]]_. It frightens livestock and breaks valuable objects, and even goes so far as to follow victims who move their households in an attempt to escape their tormentor. Despite these habits, boggarts rarely cause serious _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ to their chosen families, preferring simply to sow _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ and misery. Even though these relationships are characterized by animosity, they seem to stabilize the boggarts somewhat. Boggarts that lack households to terrorize are far less benign.

A _boggart_ is rarely spotted unless it wishes to be seen, and it has little interest in fighting fair. When preying on its victims, a _boggart_ uses its familiarity with its home terrain to its advantage, preferring to induce foes to struggle against the natural environment rather than against the _boggart_. A _boggart_ has very long arms, which it uses to _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ creatures into water or onto marshy ground; it then psychically paralyzes its victims and allows the creatures to drown. A _boggart_ is also quite skilled at setting traps and dragging its opponents into them. It sometimes uses _aversion_ to keep people away from its home, but more often uses this power to prevent anyone from helping its chosen prey.

A _boggart_’s magic is drawn from the excess _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ energy in an area. Boggarts cause mischief in order to heighten negative emotions near their homes and thus fuel their powers. It has been theorized that if a _boggart_ were isolated from such energy for long enough, it could eventually revert into a _[[monsters/Brownie|brownie]]_.

A typical _boggart_ stands 3 feet tall and weighs 70 pounds.
