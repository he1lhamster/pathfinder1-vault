  Addiction (Su): A wretchghost's touch causes wracking pain in the form of 2d6 points
    of damage-creatures that are specifically immune to pain or unliving creatures
    (undead or constructs) are immune to this damage, but otherwise this damage bypasses
    all forms of damage reduction. A creature that takes damage from a wretchghost's
    touch must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or become addicted to the drug associated
    with that particular wretchghost. If a creature fails this save and becomes addicted,
    it immediately takes that drug's damage but does not gain its effects. Once a
    creature becomes addicted to the drug, it can still take damage from the wretchghost's
    touch but suffers no additional effects from its addiction ability-indeed, the
    creature might now find itself at something of an advantage over the wretchghost
    because of the creature's susceptibility to addicts. For 1 round after a wretchghost
    causes a living creature to become addicted, the wretchghost receives a reprieve
    from the wracking phantom pains that torment it and gains a +2 bonus on all attack
    rolls, skill checks, and saving throws during that round. The save DC is Charisma-based,
    and replaces the associated drug's normal addiction save. Rules for drugs and
    addiction appear on pages 236-237 of Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide.
  Associated Drug (Ex): |-
    All wretchghosts are associated with a specific type of drug. Although some wretchghosts might have been addicted to multiple drugs in life, one addiction always takes precedence over the others when such an unfortunate becomes a wretchghost. This spirit is in constant agony as if suffering from withdrawal from the drug-a pain that can be very briefly limited only by causing living creatures to become addicted to that drug. A wretchghost's associated drug determines which addiction it causes with its incorporeal touch, which addicts that its hungering reach affects and that can affect it, with which substance its voracious frenzy interacts, and which once-per-day spell-like abilities it can access. Listed below are the spell-like abilities for all of the drugs detailed on pages 236-237 of the GameMastery Guide plus alcohol-use these as inspiration for coming up with spell-like abilities for other drugs. The standard wretchghost presented here is associated with opium.

     Aether: Dispel magic, calm emotions (DC 14).
     Alcohol: Hideous laughter (DC 14), suggestion (DC 15).
     Dwarven Fire Ale: Fire breathAPG (DC 14), protection from energy.
     Elven Absinthe: Eagle's splendor, reckless infatuationUM (DC 15).
     Flayleaf: Hold person (DC 15), slow (DC 15).
     Opium: Ray of exhaustion (DC 15), touch of idiocy.
     Pesh: Displacement, mad hallucinationUM (DC 14).
     Scour: Cat's grace, vision of hellUM (DC 15).
     Shiver: Daze monster (DC 14), deep slumber (DC 15).
     Zerk: Blur, haste.
  Hungering Reach (Su): Against foes that are addicted to its associated drug, a wretchghost
    has reach as if it were one size category larger (10-foot reach for most wretchghosts).
  Susceptible to Addicts (Ex): A creature that is addicted to the same drug associated
    with a particular wretchghost can affect the wretchghost with weapons or spells
    as if the wretchghost were not incorporeal.
  Tormented Howl (Su): Once per day as a standard action, a wretchghost can emit a
    terrible howl of need that leaves those within 40 feet staggered for 1d4+1 rounds
    (Will DC 16 negates). This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC
    is Charisma-based.
  Voracious Frenzy (Su): When in close proximity to a substance to which it was addicted
    in life (20 feet or less), a wretchghost goes into a mad frenzy that increases
    its speed but hampers its defensive reflexes. As long as this state persists,
    the wretchghost's fly speed increases by 10 feet, it gains a +2 bonus on attack
    rolls, and it takes a -4 penalty to its AC.
desc_long: |-
  When multiple wretched addicts perish in the throes of a shared drug addiction in an area infused with pain and misery, those tortured souls sometimes cling to each other, and their overwhelming hunger for just one more fix sometimes anchors them to this world. In these miserable situations, mortal souls can linger on after death as wretchghosts.

  The nature of the addiction a wretchghost suffered while it lived strongly influences its personality as well as its supernatural abilities. In all cases, it loses much of the awareness of its former life and identity- only its gnawing, toxic hunger remains. The residue of personality clinging to its psyche is ruthless and filled with hate, and it is overwhelmingly jealous of the living, who can still enjoy the bliss of its associated drug. As an incorporeal shade, the wretchghost can no longer revel in this bliss, save for brief moments when it infuses living flesh with this chemical desire. Regardless of its addiction, a wretchghost looks like a cadaverously thin phantom with sunken, glowing eyes and limbs that seem to writhe and twist more like tentacles than articulated arms and legs.

##### Description

When multiple wretched addicts perish in the throes of a shared drug addiction in an area infused with pain and misery, those tortured souls sometimes cling to each other, and their overwhelming hunger for just one more fix sometimes anchors them to this world. In these _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Miserable|miserable]]_ situations, mortal souls can linger on after death as wretchghosts.

The nature of the addiction a _wretchghost_ suffered while it lived strongly influences its personality as well as its supernatural abilities. In all cases, it loses much of the awareness of its former life and identity— only its gnawing, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Toxic|toxic]]_ hunger remains. The residue of personality clinging to its psyche is ruthless and filled with hate, and it is overwhelmingly jealous of the living, who can still enjoy the bliss of its associated drug. As an _incorporeal_ shade, the _wretchghost_ can no longer revel in this bliss, save for brief moments when it infuses living flesh with this chemical desire. Regardless of its addiction, a _wretchghost_ looks like a cadaverously thin phantom with sunken, glowing eyes and limbs that seem to writhe and twist more like tentacles than articulated arms and legs.
