  Bright Blast (Su): Three times per day, the Red Rider can erupt in flames, damaging

    at a DC 23 Reflex save or take 3d6 points of fire damage and be dazed for 1 round
    and dazzled for an additional 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Rider's Robes (Su): The Red Rider wears robes that provide the same protection as
    half-plate armor.
  Rider's Weapon (Su): Whenever the Red Rider successfully confirms a critical hit
    with his +2 flaming scimitar, the target is dazed for 1 round unless it succeeds
    at a DC 23 Fortitude save. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: The Red Rider is the most fiery and aggressive of the Three Riders. When
  Irriseni citizens share old tales of previous Riders around the hearth, stories
  of the Red Rider's judgments always go into gruesome detail about his wholesale
  slaughter and shocking violence. Some argue that the Red Rider is no more vicious
  than the Black Rider, and that the larger number of heinous tales about the Red
  Rider are simply the result of the time of day in which he engages in his tasks.
  More citizens are awake and out of their homes during the day to witness the Red
  Rider's judgments before he cedes his time to the night.

##### Description

When Irriseni citizens share old tales of previous Riders around the hearth, stories of the Red Rider’s judgments always go into gruesome detail about his wholesale slaughter and shocking violence. Some argue that the Red Rider is no more _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_ than the Black Rider, and that the larger number of heinous tales about the Red Rider are simply the result of the time of day in which he engages in his tasks. More citizens are awake and out of their homes during the day to _[[spells/Witness|witness]]_ the Red Rider’s judgments before he cedes his time to the night.
