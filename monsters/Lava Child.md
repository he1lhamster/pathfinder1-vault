special_abilities:
  Earth Glide (Ex): A burrowing lava child can pass through stone, dirt, metal, lava,
    or almost any other sort of earth as easily as a fish swims through water. Its
    burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripples or other
    signs of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing
    lava child flings the creature back 30 feet, stunning it for 1 round unless it
    succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.
  Immunity to Earth Magic (Ex): A lava child is immune to any spell or spell-like
    ability that allows spell resistance and has the earth descriptor.
  Magma Throwing (Su): A lava child can cough up a ball of magma into its hand as
    a move action. It remains hot as long as the lava child holds it, but cools to
    the ambient temperature 1 round after it is released. A lava child can throw a
    magma ball as if it were a flask of alchemist's fire, or add its damage to one
    successful claw attack. It can use this ability a number of times per day equal
    to its Hit Dice. On any round in which the lava child remains partially immersed
    in molten stone and does not leave it, it may scoop up a handful as a move action
    and then throw it as if using this ability, but that action does not count toward
    its daily limit.
  Metal Immunity (Su): Lava children ignore the presence of metal and are able to
    pass through it as easily as air. They are immune to metal weapons, and their
    attacks ignore any AC bonus (including enhancement bonuses) from metal armor and
    shields.
  Vulnerability to Cold and Water (Ex): Spells and effects with the water or cold
    subtype inflict +50% damage against lava children (though these vulnerabilities
    do not stack-effects that are both cold and water still deal only an additional
    +50% damage). Splashing a lava child with at least 1 gallon of water inflicts
    1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Immersion in water causes lava children to take
    2d6 points of damage per round and affects them as a slow spell while they remain
    submerged.
desc_long: Lava children are ill-tempered creatures created by shaitan genies. Shaped
  like stunted humanoids with the hideous heads of fanged infants, they prefer to
  reside in volcanoes. Typical lava children are 5 feet tall and 450 pounds.
