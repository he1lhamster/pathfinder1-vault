desc_short: This odd creature is about the size of a dog, but it has the slender build
  of a cat, heavy whiskers, and dark stripes down its back. Its long tail flips about,
  smacking the ground as it scans the woods. It yips and bays in a complex pattern,
  offering warning to anything that may cross its path.

  the creatures, blaming all manner of problems on them. However, thylacines are quite
  shy and antisocial, and usually avoid human settlements. Because of their odd, almost
  hybrid appearance, thylacines have a far harsher reputation than they probably should,
  playing a sort of bogeyman role in farming communities.
