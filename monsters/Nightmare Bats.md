  Nightmare bats serve the role as vultures of Hell, swooping low over the dark fields and feasting on the souls of the damned. Cowardly at heart, they travel in flights and target weak prey: the souls evil enough to warrant damnation but too weak to defend themselves adequately. If confronted by stronger opponents they first attempt to chase away the foes with their cause fear, then attack en masse in the hopes their poison balances the fight. Nightmare bats are malicious and vengeful, and gleefully answer summons to the Material Plane if it means a chance to slaughter and lord their power over mortals.

  Nightmare bats can be summoned using summon monster IV.

  Physical Characteristics: Nightmare bats resemble naked, fiendish vultures with enormous bat wings whose thin membranes have a tendency to tear, giving them a tattered, undead appearance. Their skin is dark, usually some combination of red and black, and their beaks are powerful and serrated. Each nightmare bat is approximately six feet long from beak to tail, with a wingspan half again that.
