  Infernal Slave (Ex): Nupperibos are devils, yet they are essentially mindless shells

    rather follow orders and programming instilled within them by more powerful devils.
    In the case of multiple orders, only the orders of the most powerful devil are
    followed. They can utilize simple weapons if commanded, attacking with proficiency,
    and can also manipulate simple objects like doors. Armor, more complex weapons,
    and complex tools are beyond their ability to comprehend.
desc_long: These mindless drones rank even lower than lemures and serve as little
  more than mindless sword fodder for their betters. The devils are almost like constructs
  in their mindlessness, and cannot be communicated with-they raise their spears and
  attack any non-devil on sight.
