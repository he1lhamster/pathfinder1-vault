### Special Abilities

**_Putrid_ Acid (Ex)** A _[[monsters/Putrid Ooze|putrid ooze]]_ secretes a digestive acid that

dissolves organic material and metal quickly, but doesn’t

affect stone. Each time a creature takes damage from a _putrid_

ooze’s acid, its clothing and armor take the same amount

of damage from the acid (Reflex DC 23 negates damage to

clothing and armor). A metal or wooden weapon that strikes

a _putrid ooze_ takes 2d6 points of acid damage, unless the

weapon’s wielder succeeds at a DC 23 Reflex save.

If a _putrid ooze_ remains in contact with a wooden

or metal object for 1 full round, the object takes

30 points of acid damage (no save). The save

DCs are Constitution-based.
**Splatter (Ex)** As a standard action, a _putrid_

ooze can throw a portion of its acidic sludge

at a creature within 30 feet. The _putrid_

ooze must make a successful ranged

touch attack to hit the target.

Creatures struck take 10d6 points of

acid damage.

##### Description

_Putrid_ oozes are primarily made from

organic mire _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Animated|animated]]_ with Abyssal energies.

These creatures can exist near any rift or portal

to the Abyss. They caustically _[[universal monster rules/Burn|burn]]_ through plants and

animals in pursuit of their _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_, mindless hunger.

_Putrid_ oozes get their name from their disturbing habit

of subsuming dead creatures into their own gelatinous

bodies. _Putrid_ oozes generally are a combination of

churning, gray-and-black slurries, similar to chunky

tar mixed with wet gravel, but their bodies also hold

_[[monsters/Undigested|undigested]]_ portions of the creatures they consume. At any

one time, they present a mixture of rotting limbs, severed

heads, and _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_ entrails among the miscellaneous

sludge that makes up their bodies.

Most hardy materials _putrid_ oozes consume are never

completely devoured. _Putrid_ oozes slowly break down

their meals into the same gray-black, chunky morass

that makes up their bodies. Although it’s rare for a _putrid_

ooze to starve, those weakening from hunger use the last

of their dwindling energy to seek out chasms or ravines

where they can lie in wait, hoping for meals to wander past.

In these dark places, the _putrid_ oozes go dormant, existing

as murky pools of _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sticky|sticky]]_ acid until a living creature draws

near. Though the creatures are essentially in hibernation,

all it takes is a simple touch to _[[spells/Awaken|awaken]]_ them. In contrast,

active _putrid_ oozes are intimidating sights to behold, and

rarely take anyone by surprise.

Unlike other oozes, _putrid_ oozes don’t reproduce via

mitosis—splitting into two identical, smaller oozes.

Instead, they form spontaneously from corrupted rifts

to the Abyss. Some cultists of Jubilex, demon lord of ooze

monsters, have experimented with generating _putrid_

oozes by exposing slurries of entrails, filth, and acid to

foul energies. They see the spontaneous creation of these

oozes as manifestations of the Faceless Lord.

When _putrid_ oozes take enough damage to be

destroyed, they melt into an inert pool of muck like most

other oozes, though whether _putrid_ oozes eventually

reform from such remnants is a point of debate. Some say

that sunlight further breaks down _putrid_ oozes once

they are destroyed.

A _putrid ooze_ typically covers an area that measures

12 feet by 12 feet, and piles up on itself to a height of no

more than 8 feet. A _putrid ooze_ weighs about 20 tons.
