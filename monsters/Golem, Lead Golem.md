    coats the lead golem, granting its slam attacks an additional 1d6 acid damage

    ability and prevents it from using that ability for 1d6 rounds.
  Intractable Density (Ex): The weight and sturdiness of its form grants the lead
    golem a +8 racial bonus on CMD versus bull rush and reposition combat maneuvers.
  Retributive Miasma (Ex): |-
    Any attack that overcomes the damage reduction of the lead golem causes fine lead particles to fill the air within a 5-foot radius of the lead golem. This cloud of lead persists for 1 round; any creatures within the area or that pass through the cloud are exposed to the cloud's poisonous effects. Subsequent attacks damaging the golem increase the duration of the cloud by 1 round each.
