  Hold Breath (Ex): A zeuglodon can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to
    4 times its Constitution score before it risks drowning.
  Thrash (Ex): A zeuglodon grappling a foe can thrash its body back and forth rapidly,
    dealing extra damage due to the violent motion of its whipping head. This attack
    deals 4d8+19 points of damage, but allows the grappled creature a free attempt
    to escape the grapple. If a creature escapes, it is thrown 30 feet in a random
    direction by the zeuglodon's erratic thrashing.
desc_long: The primordial zeuglodon is often mistaken for a dinosaur or other large
  reptile, in part because of its almost crocodilian mouth as well as its snake-like
  elongation. Despite these features, it is more closely related to whales and other
  cetaceans than either aquatic reptiles or fish. A zeuglodon moves through the water
  with a vertical anguiliform (eel-like) motion that seems almost to be a primitive
  version of the efficient flukedriven locomotion of its cetacean relatives. Zeuglodons
  breathe air through blowholes on the tops of their heads, though they lack the lung
  capacity to stay underwater for as long as their more evolved kin. The relative
  dimensions of their angular heads are too small to encase the enlarged brains or
  melons developed by other cetaceans for echolocation or communication with others
  of their kind, and as such zeuglodons are less social than whales and dolphins.
  What they lack in specialized anatomy, however, they make up for in sheer ferocity
  and speed. A hunting zeuglodon is a furious foe to contend with. An adult zeuglodon
  measures around 50 feet long and weighs upward of 50,000 pounds.
