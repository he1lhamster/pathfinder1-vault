title1: Devil, Tinder Devil (Ukobach)
desc_short: The light of a flaming pitchfork illuminates a creepily malformed little
  man, his red skin scarred and raw like the victim of horrific burns. Although barely
  taller than a child, his features mock those of a terrible old man with an oversized
  head, knife-like nose, and crazed round eyes flickering with wild flames.

  Animate Flames (Su): |-
    As a standard action, an ukobach can animate an existing fire of Small size or larger. Doing so requires an ukobach to make a DC 15 Wisdom check as it impresses its will upon the fire. This DC increases by +5 for every size category of the flame above Small. If an ukobach succeeds, the flame animates with the statistics of a fire elemental of the same size, and follows the ukobach's mental commands. The flames remain animate for a number of rounds equal to the ukobach's Wisdom modifier-usually 3-after which they return to being simple flames, setting the square they cease moving in alight or being extinguished, as their surroundings warrant.

    Up to five ukobachs can make use of the aid another action to each grant an adjacent ukobach a +2 bonus on this Wisdom check to animate flames (granting a maximum +10 bonus).
  Fire Leap (Su): As a swift action, an ukobach occupying the same space as a fire,
    pool of lava, vent of searing steam, or similar blaze can teleport from that burning
    feature and emerge from another within 100 feet. This ability functions similarly
    to the spell dimension door, but only between fires. Upon entering a flame, an
    ukobach is instantly aware of all flames within range through which it might exit.
    If an ukobach enters a flame and there are no others to exit through within 100
    feet, the devil's movement immediately ends and it is stunned for 1 round.
  Firebreathing (Su): An ukobach can spend a standard action to guzzle a pint of oil,
    alcohol, or similarly flammable fluid and hold the combustible liquid within its
    body. At any point within 10 minutes of doing so, the ukobach can expel the liquid
    either as a 10-foot cone of fire or a 20-foot line of flame, both dealing 3d6
    points of fire damage (Reflex DC 13 for half). Upon breathing fire an ukobach
    cannot make use of this ability again until it drinks another pint of oil. The
    save DC is Constitution-based.
  Scorch (Su): An ukobach's touch is searing hot, causing its claws and any metal
    weapon it grasps to deal an additional 1d4 points of fire damage.
desc_long: |-
  Maniacal and clever, ukobachs embody the tenacity and ever advancing genius of Hell. Legions of these tiny devils labor throughout the it, and from their efforts rise new heresies and tools of depravity. They revel in the fires of Hell and manipulate them not toward destruction, but to the creation of ever greater and more innovative diabolical ends. The keepers of Hell's furnaces, they delight in their mad work, breaking only to torment the damned with their burning tools or newest inventions.

  Ukobachs stand approximately 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 70 pounds on average. Their fire pokers are fundamentally tied to their beings and disintegrate in a flash of cinders and ash upon the devil's death. These tools hold up to 10 fistsized embers, which an ukobach can fling at its enemies.
