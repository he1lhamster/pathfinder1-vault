special_abilities:
  Leviathan's Call (Su): The tone of a bakekujira's eerie song varies from that of
    a wistful memory to a burning hatred. As a standard action, a bakekujira can sing.
    Living creatures within a 120- foot radius of a singing bakekujira must succeed
    at a DC 28 Will save or become fascinated or frightened (bakekujira's choice)
    for 1 round. Any creature that succeeds at this save cannot be affected by the
    same bakekujira's leviathan's call ability for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting
    effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Resonant Song (Su): As a standard action every 1d4 rounds, the bakekujira can release
    a damaging resonance, dealing 12d8 points of sonic damage to creatures in a 60-foot
    cone (Fortitude DC 28 for half). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Smashing Breach (Ex): As a full-round action, a swimming bakekujira can make a special
    charge attack against a creature on the water's surface. At the end of its charge,
    the whale breaches, slamming down with incredible force. Any Huge or smaller creatures
    in the bakekujira's space must succeed at a DC 28 Reflex save or take 4d8+24 points
    of bludgeoning damage and be forced into the nearest empty square adjacent to
    the bakekujira. Humanoid creatures killed by this ability rise as draugr (Pathfinder
    RPG Bestiary 2 110) in 1d6 hours. A bakekujira can use its capsize special attack
    in conjunction with this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Undead Parasites (Su): A 30-foot-radius cloud of undead fish and sea birds surrounds
    a bakekujira. Creatures starting their turn within the cloud must succeed at a
    DC 28 Will save or be nauseated for 1 round and take 6d6 points of damage. Creatures
    with the ability to channel positive energy can suppress this aura for 1 round
    by expending one use of channel energy. The bakekujira receives a Will save against
    this effect. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the channeler's caster level + the
    channeler's Charisma modifier. The channeled energy has no other effect.
desc_long: Sometimes, a whale that dies after days of anger and pain arises as an
  undead monstrosity known as a bakekujira. A bakekujira weighs about 50 tons, and
  measures from 50 to 60 feet long.
