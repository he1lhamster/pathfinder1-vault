special_abilities:
  Blood Squirt: Once per day as a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of
    opportunity, a horned lizard can squirt a 5-foot-long stream of blood from the
    corners of its eyes. The animal's blood contains noxious chemicals, and a creature
    hit by the blood must succeed at a DC 9 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4
    rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Camouflage: While in desert terrain, a horned lizard can use the Stealth skill to
    hide even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.
  Puff Up: When taking the total defense action, a horned lizard puffs up its body,
    appearing larger and more horned and gaining an additional +4 bonus to CMD against
    grapple attempts.
desc_long: Despite their sluggish, toad-like appearance, these creatures are reptiles
  with dry, spiny skin adapted to prevent water loss in their native desert environment.
  They are typically found sunning themselves on rocks during all but the hottest
  parts of the day, retreating beneath the shade of ridges or rocks when the sun is
  directly overhead. Their main method of defense is to avoid detection, but when
  their desert coloration fails to fool predators, they attempt to flee or use their
  other defensive methods, such as their unique ability to rupture blood vessels in
  their eyes so they can spray noxious blood at approaching predators. Due to their
  fierce defensive displays, horned lizards are often thought to be overly aggressive,
  though people who keep them as pets or familiars know that they can be affectionate
  creatures.
