title1: Deep Crow
is_3.5: true
desc_short: Stone shrieks and shears to ribbons beneath the raz or - tal one d step
  of a cyclopean shadow come to terrifying life. From the darkness looms a breath-stealing
  horror, a creature combining the most frightening aspects of night-stalking panther,
  carriongorged crow, and massive demon-eyed arachnid. Skulking with the terrible
  grace of some caliginous dragon, oily feathers rise into wings evocative of an abyssal
  nightscape devoid of all stars or familiar spheres. From a quadripartite maw-combining
  insectial mandibles and a slashing beak-the abomination unleashes a shrill, chittering
  screech, the forsaken scream of a creature born of nightmare and truly ancient madness.

special_abilities:
  Ancient Caw (Su): A deep crow can unleash a high-pitched squawk, a predatory shriek
    that plays upon primal fears deeply rooted in all creatures' subconscious minds.
    All except deep crows within 120 feet must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be
    frightened for 2d6 rounds. Those within 30 feet who fail their saves instead become
    panicked for 2d6 rounds. A deep crow can unleash an ancient caw once every 1d4
    rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Fear of Magic (Ex): Deep crows are highly unnerved by magic (or seemingly magical)
    effects. Should a spell or spell-like ability with a visible, obviously magical
    effect be cast within 10 feet of a deep crow, it must make a Will save or be shaken
    for 1 round. The DC of this Will save equals 10 + the spell level. Not all spells
    force a deep crow to make a save, with the GM ultimately deciding what effects
    trigger a deep crow's fear. In addition to magic, well-performed feats of legerdemain-tricks
    that exceed a DC 15 Sleight of Hand check-force a deep crow to make a DC 11 Will
    save to avoid being shaken for 1 round.
  Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a deep crow must hit with either its bite
    or both claw attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
    without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it establishes a hold it can make
    two rake attacks. It can also take flight while grappling with any creature two
    or more sizes smaller than itself.
  Light Blindness (Ex): Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as sunlight or a daylight
    spell) blinds a deep crow for 1 round. On subsequent rounds, they are dazzled
    as long as they remain in the affected area.
  Rake (Ex): Attack bonus +23, damage 2d8+2.
  Shadow Blend (Su): In any condition of illumination other than full daylight, a
    deep crow can disappear into the shadows as a standard action, giving it total
    concealment until it takes another standard action. Artificial illumination, even
    a light or continual flame spell, does not negate this ability. A daylight spell,
    however, will.
desc_long: |-
  Few explorers survive their first encounter with a deep crow. Where mundane crows content themselves on scraps and carrion, these fearsome giants of the subterranean realms hunt larger, living, and often sentient prey. Combining the most terrifying traits of crow, feline, and spider, deep crows reign over vast underground territories, nocturnal hunters in an endless night.

  An adult deep crow towers nearly 20 feet tall, with a body of sleek black fur and night-black feathers carried aloft by a wingspan often exceeding 30 feet. Powerfully muscled but light of bone, most deep crows weigh approximately 7,000 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**Ancient Caw (Su)** A _[[monsters/Deep Crow|deep crow]]_ can unleash a high-pitched squawk, a predatory shriek that plays upon primal fears deeply rooted in all creatures’ subconscious minds. All except deep crows within 120 feet must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_ for 2d6 rounds. Those within 30 feet who fail their saves instead become _[[conditions/Panicked|panicked]]_ for 2d6 rounds. A _deep crow_ can unleash an ancient caw once every 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting _fear_ effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**_Fear_ of Magic (Ex)** Deep crows are highly unnerved by magic (or seemingly magical) effects. Should a spell or spell-like ability with a visible, obviously magical effect be cast within 10 feet of a _deep crow_, it must make a Will save or be _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 1 round. The DC of this Will save equals 10 + the spell level. Not all spells force a _deep crow_ to make a save, with the GM ultimately deciding what effects trigger a _deep crow_’s _fear_. In addition to magic, well-performed feats of legerdemain—tricks that exceed a DC 15 Sleight of Hand check—force a _deep crow_ to make a DC 11 Will save to avoid being _shaken_ for 1 round.

**Improved _[[universal monster rules/Grab|Grab]]_ (Ex)** To use this ability, a _deep crow_ must hit with either its bite or both claw attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it establishes a hold it can make two _rake_ attacks. It can also take _[[universal monster rules/Flight|flight]]_ while grappling with any creature two or more sizes smaller than itself.

**_Light Blindness_ (Ex)** Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as sunlight or a _[[spells/Daylight|daylight]]_ spell) blinds a _deep crow_ for 1 round. On subsequent rounds, they are _[[conditions/Dazzled|dazzled]]_ as long as they remain in the affected area.

**_Rake_ (Ex)** Attack bonus +23, damage 2d8+2.
**_Shadow_ _Blend_ (Su)** In any condition of illumination other than full _daylight_, a _deep crow_ can disappear into the shadows as a standard action, giving it total concealment until it takes another standard action. Artificial illumination, even a light or _[[spells/Continual Flame|continual flame]]_ spell, does not negate this ability. A _daylight_ spell, however, will.
