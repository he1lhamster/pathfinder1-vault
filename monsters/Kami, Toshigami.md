  Touch of Ages (Su): When a toshigami hits a target with a touch attack or any melee
    weapon, the target must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save to avoid being magically
    aged. When a toshigami strikes a foe, it must decide whether it wishes to physically
    increase the target's age or mentally reduce the target's age. If it increases
    the target's physical age, the target takes 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, and
    Constitution drain. If it decreases the target's mental age, the target takes
    1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain. Combined with the toshigami's
    numerous attacks, this can quickly devastate a target, but once a target succeeds
    at its saving throw against the touch of ages, it can no longer be affected by
    this ability for 1 round. This is a magical aging effect, but does not actually
    alter the victim's true age-it merely simulates the creeping effect of age on
    the flesh or the reversion to an increasingly infantile state of mind. The save
    DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  Toshigami, known also as blossom kami, are associated with cherry trees-particularly those that grow in inhabited areas. Often, long after a city has fallen to ruin, these kami guardians are all that remain to remember the lost city's glory. In this way, the toshigami are also associated with the passing of time.

  Toshigami rarely show themselves except to those in dire need or who are harming their trees. Still, they have a fascination with mortals, and have even been known to form romantic relationships with them on occasion. A toshigami is 5 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.

##### Description

Toshigami, known also as blossom kami, are associated with cherry trees—particularly those that grow in inhabited areas. Often, long after a city has _[[monsters/Fallen|fallen]]_ to ruin, these kami guardians are all that remain to remember the lost city’s glory. In this way, the toshigami are also associated with the passing of time.

Toshigami rarely show themselves except to those in dire need or who are harming their trees. Still, they have a fascination with mortals, and have even been known to form romantic relationships with them on occasion. A toshigami is 5 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.
