### Special Abilities

**_Irradiate_ Domain (Su)** The area of a cave _blight_’s cursed domain becomes infused with radioactive rock formations that manifest as glowing green crystals shedding illumination as per a _[[items/Mundane/Candle|candle]]_ and faint warmth. This radiation interferes with teleportation effects—a creature attempting to cast teleport to travel into or out of a cave _blight_’s domain must succeed at a DC 30 caster level check or the spell fails. In addition, all creatures that enter the _blight_’s domain must succeed at a DC 31 Fortitude save every 10 minutes to avoid taking 1 point of Constitution drain (this increases to 1d4 points of Constitution drain within 10 feet of a cave _blight_). This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Petrification (Su)** A creature stung by a cave _blight_ must succeed at a DC 31 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Dexterity drain. A living non-ooze creature that is immune to poison loses its _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to poison as long as it suffers any Dexterity drain from this sting. A creature whose Dexterity score is drained to 0 becomes _[[conditions/Petrified|petrified]]_, as per _[[spells/Flesh to Stone|flesh to stone]]_. The save DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

Cave blights are radioactive oozes that dwell in immense networks of caverns deep below the surface of the world. There, they seek to ruin underground societies—especially _[[monsters/Svirfneblin|svirfneblin]]_ settlements, for deep gnomes particularly enrage these oozes due to their ancient links to the primal realm of the fey. Cave blights alone among their kind are adept at magically compelling aberrations to aid them in their wars against other intelligent life.

A cave _blight_ measures 7 feet across and weighs 600 pounds on average.
