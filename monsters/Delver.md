special_abilities:
  Compression (Ex): A delver's boneless body can squeeze through spaces that would
    normally exclude anything larger than a Medium creature; it does not need to make
    Escape Artist checks to pass through such spaces. When it squeezes through a 5-foot
    opening, its speed is reduced to 5 feet until it passes completely through.
  Corrosive Slime (Ex): The delver's skin is covered in an acidic slime that it uses
    to dissolve stone and defend against enemies. The slime deals 2d6 acid damage
    to flesh, 4d8 damage to metal, or 8d10 to stone or crystal. If the delver hits
    with a natural attack or grapple, it automatically adds its slime damage, and
    the slime continues to deal 2d6 damage per round for the next 2 rounds. Armor
    or clothing worn by a creature grappled by a delver takes the same amount of acid
    damage unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex saving throw. A quart or more
    of water can wash away the slime. Any weapon that strikes the delver takes slime
    damage, as does a creature grappling or attacking the delver with natural weapons
    (both Reflex half DC 22). The saves are Constitution-based.
  Sculpt Stone (Ex): A delver can secrete a weaker form of its slime from its tentacles
    that momentarily softens stone rather than destroying it, allowing the creature
    to reshape up to 25 cubic feet of stone as if using stone shape as a 15th-level
    caster. This ability has no effect on stone that is protected against acid. It
    can use this ability at will.
desc_long: Delvers are enormous gastropods covered with corrosive slime and designed
  for burrowing through stone. Fifteen feet long and weighing several tons, they are
  most commonly encountered deep below ground, particularly near underground water
  sources. Surprisingly intelligent, these juggernauts exist to tunnel, surviving
  off metals- which they find intoxicating, and sometimes maddening- and leaving behind
  smooth, 10-foot-diameter passages.

##### Description

Delvers are enormous gastropods covered with _corrosive_ slime and designed for burrowing through stone. Fifteen feet long and weighing several tons, they are most commonly encountered deep below ground, particularly near underground water sources. Surprisingly intelligent, these juggernauts exist to tunnel, surviving off metals— which they find intoxicating, and sometimes maddening— and leaving behind smooth, 10-foot-diameter passages.
