### Special Abilities

**Heliotrope (Ex)** Sunflower leshys reflect the sun and other sources of bright light from their faces onto all who come too close. Any creature within 20 feet of a sunflower leshy must succeed at a DC 13 Will saving throw or be _[[conditions/Dazzled|dazzled]]_ for 1d4+1 rounds. A creature _dazzled_ once cannot be _dazzled_ again by the same leshy for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
**Seed Spray (Ex)** Three times per day, a sunflower leshy can spray seeds in a 15-foot cone as a standard action. The spray deals 1d4 points of piercing damage to all targets in its area of effect. Against _dazzled_ targets, this attack instead deals 1d6 points of piercing damage. A successful DC 14 Reflex saving throw halves the damage from this attack. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

##### Description

A circle of petals radiates from a sunflower leshy’s head, ranging in color from soft butter yellow to bright orange to plum with white tips. Serrated green leaves sprout like a ruff beneath its head. A sunflower leshy stands 4 feet tall and weighs 75 pounds.

Among the most social of leshys, sunflower leshys serve as the ambassadors and diplomats of leshykind. They enjoy socializing and interacting in groups of leshys or with other creatures. Solitary sunflower leshys are rare, as their need for companionship compels them to find others with whom to interact. Leshys who lack companionship for 1 week lose their petals and heliotrope aura as a result of being depressed. Being welcomed back into a group restores the aura in a day and petals after 1 week.

Sunflower leshys are peacemakers and shun martial activities and conflict unless forced into confrontation. To avoid altercations with unfriendly creatures, they band together and trust that the presence of their heliotrope aura protects them. Other leshys look to them to serve as mediators and help resolve differences.
