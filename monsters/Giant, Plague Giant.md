**Treasure** standard (mwk _[[items/Weapon/Light flail|light flail]]_, 4 rocks or

### Special Abilities

**Disease (Ex)** Although plague giants are immune to disease, they carry a highly contagious plague that causes flesh to rot and limbs to wither over time in those damaged with the giants’ weaponry.

Atrophic Plague: Injury; save Fort DC 26; onset immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Dex drain and 1d4 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Hurl Corpse (Su)** A plague giant can throw a Small or Medium corpse as if it were hurling a rock. Hurled corpses deal damage as per a plague giant’s thrown rocks but as if the giant were one size category smaller (2d6 points of damage + 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier for most plague giants). In addition, the hurled corpse is infused with the plague giant’s pestilence, exposing the creature struck to the giant’s atrophic plague. Upon _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Impact|impact]]_, a hurled corpse explodes into a cloud of thick _[[monsters/Gray|gray]]_ vapor that fills a 10-foot-radius area with thick mist that obscures _[[spells/Vision|vision]]_ as per _[[spells/Fog Cloud|fog cloud]]_. Any creature that begins its turn within this cloud must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or be _[[conditions/Nauseated|nauseated]]_ for 1 round. The cloud persists for 1d4 rounds before dissipating naturally (if not dissipated earlier via a moderate or stronger wind). The save DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

Plague giants resemble enormous lepers or plague sufferers, yet they are not so much victims of disease as they are servants of sickness. Most plague giants worship the Horseman of Pestilence or other deities associated with disease, and they have no _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ of sickness themselves. Pestilence spreads wherever the plague giants dwell, and thus they are shunned by most humanoids. Sometimes, however, plague giants lead daemon cults consisting of diseased humanoids who were ostracized by their own kind. It seems likely that plague giants were once some other form of giant before they turned to daemon worship, though no other race of giant will claim them as wayward children. Plague giants themselves find such rumors particularly distasteful, and point out that they are much more than this, reasoning that when a “lesser giant” gets sick, it doesn’t suddenly transform into a plague giant.

The average plague giant is 24 feet tall and weigh 15,000 pounds.
