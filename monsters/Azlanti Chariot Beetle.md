##### Description

These mighty beetles once served the Azlanti war machine. They darkened the skies on their now-withered vestigial wings with a dozen war wizards on their back. These powerful specimens possessed strange abilities that allowed them to deflect magic with ease and hurl down eldritch fire to reduce enemies to ash. After thousands of years without purpose and their masters long dead, these beetles have degenerated to barely remarkable vermin, whose once army-blasting carapace now merely sparkles weakly to befuddle the minds of those nearby. They bury nearly every creature they meet, _[[spells/Sending|sending]]_ their victims to join their Azlanti masters below the ground.
