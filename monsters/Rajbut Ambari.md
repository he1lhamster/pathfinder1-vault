##### Description

Horrors born from the depths of Vudra’s endless jungles, rajput ambari are undead elephants granted terrible powers through necromantic rites. Massive and terrifying, many of these earth-shaking undead behemoths retain the exotic trappings and elegant finery of the Vudrani princes who once doted upon them. The glory of such beasts is long forgotten, though, as most serve as _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Unholy|unholy]]_ slaves and fearless beasts of war for uncaring necromancers and _[[spells/Deathless|deathless]]_ masters.
