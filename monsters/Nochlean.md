  Child-Scent (Ex): A nochlean has the scent ability, but only with respect to humanoid
    children and immature animals. Thus, the nochlean could sniff out a child's hiding
    place or a den of wolf pups, but it could not sniff out the child's parents or
    the den mother.
  Music Susceptibility (Su): A nochlean is sensitive to music of all kinds, and different
    styles of music affect the nochlean in different ways. A creature within 20 feet
    of a nochlean can attempt to affect the creature with a Perform (keyboard, percussion,
    sing, string, or wind) check made as a standard action or when used to initiate
    another effect, such as a bardic performance. The nochlean must succeed at a Will
    saving throw with a DC equal to the result of the Perform check or become affected
    by the music for as long as the music persists. The nochlean is sickened by keyboard
    instruments, shaken by percussion instruments, enraged (per the rage spell) by
    singing, staggered by string instruments, and confused by wind instruments. The
    nochlean can be affected by only one type of music at a time; if it fails its
    saving throw against multiple types of music, only that with the highest Perform
    check result applies.
desc_long: |-
  Predatory fey that delight in vandalizing homes, murdering pets, and stealing children, nochleans resemble incredibly thin, gangly humanoids with coarse black hair, large yellow eyes, and wickedly sharp claws. Their most recognizable features, however, are their extraordinary large ears. A nochlean's earlobes are several feet long, and it usually keeps them wrapped around its neck like a scarf or draped over its hands to conceal its claws from casual notice.

   Nochleans enjoy their wicked activities, frequently tittering from the shadows as they plan to raid a home, murder livestock, or lure away a lonely child. Nochleans are bold and crafty schemers who attack only when they feel like they have the advantage. A nochlean's careful plans evaporate in the presence of music, however, as the notes echoing around in their large ears affect them in erratic ways. Most nochleans flee from any source of music, and many tales tell of lone travelers unknowingly repelling the lurking creatures with casual whistling.

   A nochlean stands 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs 50 pounds.
