  Blasting Critical (Ex): When a cannon golem confirms a critical hit with a slam
    attack, it can make one cannon attack against that target as a free action (as
    long as the cannon is loaded).
  Cannon (Ex): The golem's cannon has a range increment of 100 feet and deals 6d6
    points of bludgeoning and piercing damage on a hit with a ×4 critical modifier.
    The cannon's magazine can hold up to 20 cannonballs at a time-reloading a single
    cannonball into this magazine is a standard action for the golem, while loading
    a cannonball into the cannon itself to fire it is a swift action; this allows
    the golem to take two shots per round with the cannon.
  Gun Training (Ex): A cannon golem adds its Dex modifier to the damage dealt by its
    cannon.
  Immunity to Magic (Ex): A cannon golem is immune to spells and spell-like abilities
    that allow spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against
    it, as noted below. Any spell with the water descriptor that affects a cannon
    golem renders its cannon unusable for 1 round (no save).A heat metal spell causes
    the golem's cannon to instantly backfire, dealing 6d6 points of damage to the
    golem and staggering it for 1 round (no save).
