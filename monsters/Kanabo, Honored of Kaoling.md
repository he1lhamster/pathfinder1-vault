Within Kaoling, those oni that take the form of hobgoblins—known as ja noi—are treated as honored champions. While ja noi have an overwhelming need to engage in regular battle and _command_ troops, and can be dangerous if too much time passes between fights, this drive is easily met by Kaoling’s regular military operations, and most _hobgoblin_ soldiers are only too willing to fight at a ja noi’s _command_. While other oni are respected for their size and strength, they are generally treated as valued allies rather than members of Kaoling society. Ja noi, by contrast, are embraced as revered cousins, and closely integrated into Kaoling communities.

Though rare, sometimes such close association leads to children being born with one ja noi and one _hobgoblin_ parent. These half-ja noi offspring are known as kanabo, a term that can also be used to refer to an iron _[[items/Weapon/Club|club]]_ or translated as meaning “the strongest,” which is how the hobgoblins of Kaoling view the oni-kin among them. Kanabo inherit much of their oni parent’s vitality, mystic power, and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cunning|cunning]]_, but lack the ja noi drive to fight even when no foe is present.
