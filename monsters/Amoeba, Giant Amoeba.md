desc_long: A giant amoeba is a shapeless mass of living, liquid protoplasm. Though
  naturally translucent with darker interior spots, its surface is slightly sticky
  and tends to collect dirt and other debris from its environment; therefore, a moving
  giant amoeba looks like muddy water. A weaker cousin of creatures such as the gray
  ooze and black pudding, a giant amoeba is actually a mutated version of a harmless
  creature too small to be seen by the naked eye, grown dangerously large in size.
  Although happy to prey on creatures smaller than it, the giant amoeba's constant
  hunger often drives it to attack larger prey, such as humanoids.

##### Description

A giant amoeba is a shapeless mass of living, liquid protoplasm. Though naturally translucent with darker interior spots, its surface is slightly _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sticky|sticky]]_ and tends to collect dirt and other debris from its environment; therefore, a moving giant amoeba looks like muddy water. A weaker cousin of creatures such as the _[[monsters/Gray Ooze|gray ooze]]_ and _[[monsters/Black Pudding|black pudding]]_, a giant amoeba is actually a mutated version of a harmless creature too small to be seen by the naked eye, grown dangerously large in size. Although happy to prey on creatures smaller than it, the giant amoeba’s constant hunger often drives it to attack larger prey, such as humanoids.
