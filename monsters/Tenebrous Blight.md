  Darken Flames (Ex): Any nonmagical fire that comes into contact with a tenebrous
    blight immediately turns into a dark, purplish-black flame that sheds no light.
    These fires must still consume fuel, and they die out just as normal fires do.
    These dark flames-often called blight fires- are particularly effective in inducing
    hypnosis, granting their possessor a +4 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks
    made to hypnotize a creature using the hypnotism occult skill unlock (Pathfinder
    RPG Occult Adventures 195) so long as the blight fire is present. Many psychic
    inhabitants of the Darklands covet blight fires and go to great lengths to acquire
    them and keep them burning indefinitely.
  Psychic Trauma Spores (Su): 'A tenebrous blight's spores float around it in a shadowy
    cloud out to a distance of 30 feet. Any creature entering the spore cloud, as
    well as any creature beginning its turn in the radius of the spore cloud, must
    succeed at a DC 18 Will saving throw once per round or suffer the following effects,
    which grow progressively worse with each failed saving throw: on the first failed
    save, the creature suffers the effects of the paranoiaOA spell for as long as
    it remains within the spore cloud and for 2d4 rounds after leaving; on the second,
    the creature permanently loses the ability to see in color; on the third, the
    creature permanently loses the ability to see at a distance greater than 60 feet;
    on the fourth, the creature becomes permanently blind. A blind creature suffering
    from paranoia that fails its save against the spores instead takes 1d4 points
    of Wisdom damage per failed save. Any effect that cures blindness can also cure
    any of the sight-altering effects caused by the spores. The save DC is Constitution-based.'
  Tenebrous Aura (Ex): The light level around a tenebrous blight is always two steps
    lower than normal (to a minimum of supernatural darkness like that created by
    deeper darkness). This is not a darkness effect, and it applies after determining
    the interactions of all light and darkness effects.
desc_long: Tenebrous blights threaten the deepest caverns of the Darklands and places
  where the veil between the Material Plane and the Plane of Shadow is thin. Tenebrous
  blights instinctively attack any creatures that disturb them, weakening intruders
  with the harrowing effects of their spores and lashing out with their shadowy tendrils.
  Xulgaths (see page 61) are the only known creatures that can safely disturb a tenebrous
  blight's spores-a sideeffect of the reptilian humanoids' psychogenic secretions.
  Xulgaths often use tenebrous blights as guardians and obstacles to impede trespassers
  in their territory. Tenebrous blights are 25 feet tall and weigh 4,000 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**Darken Flames (Ex)** Any nonmagical fire that comes into contact with a _[[monsters/Tenebrous Blight|tenebrous blight]]_ immediately turns into a dark, purplish-black flame that sheds no light. These fires must still consume fuel, and they die out just as normal fires do. These dark flames—often _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ _[[spells/Blight|blight]]_ fires— are particularly effective in inducing hypnosis, granting their possessor a +4 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks made to hypnotize a creature using the _[[spells/Hypnotism|hypnotism]]_ occult skill unlock (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 195) so long as the _blight_ fire is present. Many _psychic_ inhabitants of the Darklands covet _blight_ fires and go to great lengths to acquire them and keep them _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Burning|burning]]_ indefinitely.

**_Psychic_ Trauma Spores (Su)** A _tenebrous blight_’s spores float around it in a shadowy cloud out to a distance of 30 feet. Any creature entering the spore cloud, as well as any creature beginning its turn in the radius of the spore cloud, must succeed at a DC 18 Will saving throw once per round or suffer the following effects, which grow progressively worse with each failed saving throw: on the first failed save, the creature suffers the effects of the _[[spells/Paranoia|paranoia]]_ spell for as long as it remains within the spore cloud and for 2d4 rounds after leaving; on the second, the creature permanently loses the ability to see in color; on the third, the creature permanently loses the ability to see at a distance greater than 60 feet; on the fourth, the creature becomes permanently blind. A blind creature suffering from _paranoia_ that fails its save against the spores instead takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage per failed save. Any effect that cures blindness can also cure any of the sight-altering effects caused by the spores. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Tenebrous Aura (Ex)** The light level around a _tenebrous blight_ is always two steps lower than normal (to a minimum of supernatural _[[spells/Darkness|darkness]]_ like that created by _[[spells/Deeper Darkness|deeper darkness]]_). This is not a _darkness_ effect, and it applies after determining the interactions of all light and _darkness_ effects.

##### Description

Tenebrous blights threaten the deepest caverns of the Darklands and places where the _[[spells/Veil|veil]]_ between the Material Plane and the Plane of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|Shadow]]_ is thin. Tenebrous blights instinctively attack any creatures that disturb them, weakening intruders with the _[[spells/Harrowing|harrowing]]_ effects of their spores and lashing out with their shadowy tendrils. Xulgaths (see page 61) are the only known creatures that can safely disturb a _tenebrous blight_’s spores—a sideeffect of the reptilian humanoids’ psychogenic secretions. Xulgaths often use tenebrous blights as guardians and obstacles to impede trespassers in their territory. Tenebrous blights are 25 feet tall and weigh 4,000 pounds.
