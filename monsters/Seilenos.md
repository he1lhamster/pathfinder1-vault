and 3–9 leanan sidhe, maenads, or storm giants)
**Treasure** standard (_composite longbow_ with 40 mithral arrows,

mithral _morningstar_, mwk pipes, other treasure)

### Special Abilities

**Dramatic Flourish (Su)** As a standard action while its

impossible verisimilitude is active, a _[[monsters/Seilenos|seilenos]]_ can inspire

strong emotions in all enemies, all allies, or all creatures

(_seilenos_’s choice) within 120 feet that can hear or see it,

replicating the effect of a spell of the _seilenos_’s choice:

_charm monster_, _confusion_, _crushing despair_, _fear_, _good hope_,

_[[spells/Joyful Rapture|joyful rapture]]_, _reckless infatuation_, _suggestion_, vengeful

outrage, or _waves of ecstasy_. A creature that successfully

saves against a _seilenos_’s dramatic flourish can’t be affected

by that _seilenos_’s dramatic flourish again for 24 hours.

Any save DC is 30, regardless of which effect the _seilenos_

chooses. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**_Grace_ (Su)** A _seilenos_ gains a _deflection_ bonus to AC equal to

his Charisma bonus (minimum +1).

**Impossible Verisimilitude (Su)** As a standard action, a

_seilenos_ can begin telling a story so supernaturally vivid that

the elements described spring to life, replicating the effect

of a spell of the _seilenos_’s choice: screen, _[[spells/Shades|shades]]_ (can also

_[[monsters/Mimic|mimic]]_ _summon_ nature’s ally VIII), or _[[spells/Veil|veil]]_. It must use a free

action to continue the performance each round; if it doesn’t,

the illusion immediately ends. As part of this free action,

the _seilenos_ can add, remove, or change one illusion effect

each round, to a maximum of three simultaneous illusions.

Any save DC is 30, regardless of which effect the _seilenos_

chooses. The save DC is Charisma-based.
**Sustaining Joy (Su)** As long as it is within 60 feet of one or

more other creatures that have a morale bonus or are under

a harmless effect with the emotion descriptor, the _seilenos_

gains _[[universal monster rules/Regeneration|regeneration]]_ 15.

**Thyrsus (Su)** Any weapon a _seilenos_ wields functions as a +5

weapon. Whenever the _seilenos_ strikes a foe with a weapon,

he can spend a swift action to use a spell-like ability of 6th

level or lower that can target that foe. Only the creature

struck can be affected by the spell-like ability.

**Versatile Performance (Ex)** A _seilenos_ can use versatile

performance as a 20th-level _[[classes/Bard|bard]]_, using the chosen

Perform modifier for checks with the corresponding skills.

##### Description

Elder kin to satyrs, seilenoi are primeval fey bound to the

basest emotions, including lust, joy, surprise, aggression,

and _fear_. These fey wander the world, indulging in any

excuse to experience or inspire passionate feelings.

New spectacles of beauty, physical adventure, and

psychoactive plants and alcohol draw their attention, and

they encourage creatures they encounter to be equally

experimental. Seilenoi particularly enjoy luring stodgy,

honorable, or self-important beings into grandiose acts

of foolishness or indulgence. Although less notorious

than satyrs for sexual exploits, seilenoi possess a rugged

animal magnetism and an appreciation for all sorts of

carnal pleasures. They are particularly renowned for

their insight and skill as storytellers and playwrights.

Like satyrs, seilenoi prefer to keep to untamed wilds

where they revel in the passionate emotions of the fey

and beasts that live, grow, and play there. Creatures of

the forest often f lock to seilenoi in small troupes or even

traveling courts. Satyrs, leanan sidhe, and muses (see

page 179) enjoy the artistry of a _seilenos_’s storytelling.

Centaurs and maenads revere seilenoi for inspiring

irresistibly passionate, ecstatic _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_. The _seilenos_ acts

as a mercurial judge, jocular keeper of fey culture and

secrets, and sometimes self-centered celebrity to these

groups. Seilenoi traveling across the ocean often take on

ichthyocentaurs as seafaring guides and

honor guards. Most seilenoi get separated from their

courts eventually, either because their fey followers

move on to more sedate leaders or because the

_seilenos_ feels stif led and drunkenly wanders off

in search of a change of pace.

Seilenoi who do not lead their own fey

courts sometimes serve as jesters, emissaries,

unpredictable generals, or companions for fey

lords, deities, or other mighty beings. Seilenoi

prove surprisingly dangerous on the battlefield,

as they dash about scattering scores of enemies with

every cutting joke and inspiring monologue. When

dealing with more numerous foes, they confound the

battlefield with seemingly natural barriers and illusory

sheets of roaring f lame. Others enjoy deflating the egos

of powerful fey (and, occasionally, mortals) with bitingly

insightful satire.

In their wanderings, seilenoi sometimes seek out new

kinds of indulgence and _[[universal monster rules/Distraction|distraction]]_ among mortals, in

which case these fey generally prove themselves amiable,

though gruff. Seilenoi can charm almost anyone with

raucous affection or witty commentary. Those they can’t

talk into joining the revelry, they generally ply with

alcohol or psychotropic plants to lower the inhibitions of

civilization and enable a freer expression of raw emotion.

Bored seilenoi occasionally take it upon themselves to

mentor mortals with exceptional self-awareness and

power. Sometimes they do so while disguised with

_[[spells/Polymorph|polymorph]]_ magic to avoid undue attention.

Seilenoi are passionate creatures, as thrilled

by the chance to have a drunken brawl with new

opponents as to explore the body of a new lover.

Usually, seilenoi view combat as a sort of hunting or

wrestling game, but if they recognize true hostility, they

become a terrifying force. A _seilenos_ never faces combat

alone; it summons allies to distract foes if necessary and

hides an ever-shifting _mirage arcana_ while _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Rallying|rallying]]_ allies

and keeping foes off balance by manipulating their

emotions. Its illusions represent the natural elements

with which a _seilenos_ is familiar, from fantastical mazes

of writhing vines to confusing clouds of spores. It is

particularly amused by exchanging the appearances of

enemies and allies. Seilenoi have also been known to

transform especially vexing foes into harmless animals

or useful plants.

Although their wide range of moods tends toward joy

and frivolity, all seilenoi at times indulge in the insidious

thrill of violence, hatred, or madness. When filled with

these dark passions, a _seilenos_ might provoke a battle

among evenly matched friends to watch the tense contest

or dive headlong into the _[[conditions/Confused|confused]]_ heart of a fray.

Seilenoi are about the same size and weight as male

humans, although they tend toward the heavier end of

that range.
