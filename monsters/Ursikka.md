### Special Abilities

**Coat Claws (Ex)** As a standard action, an _[[monsters/Ursikka|ursikka]]_ can coat its

pincerlike claws with freezing, viscous saliva. This coating

lasts for 1 minute. Any creature hit by an _ursikka_’s

coated claws or _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ by an _ursikka_ using the

_Snatch_ feat takes an additional 2d6 points of cold

damage (Reflex DC 22 half).

**Freezing Saliva (Ex)** The saliva that drips from an

_ursikka_’s mouth is _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sticky|sticky]]_ as well as cold, causing

creatures to become _[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_ for 1d4 rounds (Reflex

DC 22 negates). While _entangled_, creatures take 2d6

points of cold damage each round. An _entangled_

creature can break free before the end of this

duration by succeeding at a DC 19 Strength

check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the

encasing saliva with either a slashing weapon

or fire damage. Using fire to remove the

saliva damages the _entangled_ creature as

well. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Hibernation (Ex)** An _ursikka_ can enter

a prolonged state of hibernation by

surrounding itself with its spittle, which hardens into a cocoon.

While hibernating, an _ursikka_ doesn’t need to drink or eat. The

cocoon has hardness 10 and 60 hit points, and is immune to

fire damage. As long as the cocoon remains intact, the _ursikka_

remains unharmed in its hibernation. An _ursikka_ must use its

attacks to break free from its cocoon.
**Spit (Ex)** As a standard action, an _ursikka_ can spit a 60-foot

line of its saliva. Creatures in the area take 8d6 points of

cold damage and become _entangled_. A successful DC 22

Reflex save halves the damage and negates the _entangled_

condition. The save DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

_Ursikka_ are _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_ apex predators that rule vast arctic

territories. Held aloft by four slender legs, on which they

skitter with unsettling speed, _ursikka_ can reach heights

of 25 feet, with a long, lean abdomen accounting for

most of their 20-foot length. Their grasping forearms

each end in a sharp pincer capable of shearing f lesh

from bone, and shaggy fur covers the majority of their

bodies. The _ursikka_’s most unusual trait, however,

is a three-part maw that can open wide enough to

swallow humans whole. Freezing saliva drips constantly

from these gnashing mandibles, injuring and trapping

prey. With only a bestial intellect, _ursikka_ view all smaller

creatures as food, and think nothing of invading and

devouring entire humanoid communities.
