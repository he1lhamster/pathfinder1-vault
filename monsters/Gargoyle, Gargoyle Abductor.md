  Many races adorn their buildings and structures with carved gargoyles to make them look more fearsome, to ward off evil spirits, or in the hope of making real gargoyles think another tribe is already occupying the area. Many magic-users also create constructs in the shapes and forms of gargoyles, emulating those creatures' ability to blend in with stone structures and taking advantage of the pervasiveness of sculpted gargoyles to create stealthy protectors and watchdogs.

  Many spellcasters construct gargoyle guardians that have special abilities, making them even more capable and vigilant sentinels.

  Gargoyle Sentry (+0 CR): These gargoyle guardians are created with eyes of citrine linked to a 1-footdiameter orb of the same stone. The orb always displays what the gargoyle guardian sees, though without the construct's darkvision or low-light vision. If the gargoyle sentry is destroyed, its eyes and the linked orb shatter into worthless dust.

##### Description

Many races adorn their buildings and structures with carved gargoyles to make them look more fearsome, to ward off evil spirits, or in the hope of making real gargoyles think another tribe is already occupying the area. Many magic-users also create constructs in the shapes and forms of gargoyles, emulating those creatures’ ability to _[[spells/Blend|blend]]_ in with stone structures and taking advantage of the pervasiveness of sculpted gargoyles to create _[[feats/Stealthy|stealthy]]_ protectors and watchdogs.

Many spellcasters construct _gargoyle_ guardians that have special abilities, making them even more capable and _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Vigilant|vigilant]]_ sentinels.

**_Gargoyle_ Sentry (+0 CR)**: These _gargoyle_ guardians are created with eyes of citrine linked to a 1-footdiameter orb of the same stone. The orb always displays what the _gargoyle_ _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Guardian|guardian]]_ sees, though without the construct’s _darkvision_ or _[[universal monster rules/Low-Light Vision|low-light vision]]_. If the _gargoyle_ sentry is destroyed, its eyes and the linked orb _[[spells/Shatter|shatter]]_ into worthless dust.
