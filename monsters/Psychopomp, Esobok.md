  Eater of the Dead (Su): Esoboks enjoy eating undead flesh, and are immune to the
    nauseated and sickened conditions.
  Wrench Spirit (Su): If an esobok begins its turn grappling a living or undead creature,
    it can attempt to wrench that creature's animating spirit free as a standard action.
    If the target succeeds at a DC 14 Will save, it takes 1d6 points of force damage;
    if the target fails, its spirit is stripped from its body. This effect instantly
    destroys mindless undead that have fewer Hit Dice than the esobok and leaves all
    other undead dazed. All other targets are paralyzed. Once per round, a creature
    dazed or paralyzed by this effect can attempt a new saving throw to free its soul
    from the esobok's jaws. An esobok can't use its bite attack while it holds a disembodied
    spirit, but it can release the spirit as a free action, at which point the daze
    or paralysis effect ends. Creatures without souls (such as constructs and oozes)
    and creatures whose bodies and souls are one unit (such as outsiders) are immune
    to this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  Esoboks constitute a vicious predator caste of psychopomps. They patrol graveyards as feral hunters, hungry for undead flesh. As outsiders, esoboks don't have to eat and draw no sustenance from this behavior, but the spark of undeath is a feast for their every sense, and they pursue and ravenously consume undead creatures at every opportunity. 

  Esoboks' unruly nature and limited intelligence make them ideal border guards and “attack animals,” although their behavior can be alien and unsettling to those who expect them to display either more animalistic instincts or the sophisticated intellects of other psychopomps. These predators are never trusted to retrieve the souls of the fallen, but they are often called to the Material Plane to help contain outbreaks of undead-in such situations, their joy at the taste of undead flesh generally prevents them from attacking living targets, despite their lust for battle. 

  Some psychopomps (particularly vanths; Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 221) have developed methods of training esoboks to realize greater potentials, allowing the creatures to tap into newfound reservoirs of magical ability. These trained esoboks have the advanced creature simple template and gain access to the following spell-like abilities, each usable once per day: ear-piercing scream, haunting mists, and teleport. The typical esobok stands 3 feet tall at the shoulder, is nearly as wide, and weighs upward of 300 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**Eater of the Dead (Su)** Esoboks enjoy eating undead flesh, and are immune to the _[[conditions/Nauseated|nauseated]]_ and _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ conditions.

**Wrench Spirit (Su)** If an esobok begins its turn grappling a living or undead creature, it can attempt to wrench that creature’s animating spirit free as a standard action. If the target succeeds at a DC 14 Will save, it takes 1d6 points of force damage; if the target fails, its spirit is stripped from its body. This effect instantly destroys mindless undead that have fewer Hit Dice than the esobok and leaves all other undead _[[conditions/Dazed|dazed]]_. All other targets are _[[conditions/Paralyzed|paralyzed]]_. Once per round, a creature _dazed_ or _paralyzed_ by this effect can attempt a new saving throw to free its soul from the esobok’s jaws. An esobok can’t use its bite attack while it holds a disembodied spirit, but it can release the spirit as a free action, at which point the _[[spells/Daze|daze]]_ or _[[universal monster rules/Paralysis|paralysis]]_ effect ends. Creatures without souls (such as constructs and oozes) and creatures whose bodies and souls are one unit (such as outsiders) are immune to this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.

##### Description

Esoboks constitute a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_ predator caste of psychopomps. They patrol graveyards as feral hunters, hungry for undead flesh. As outsiders, esoboks don’t have to eat and draw no sustenance from this behavior, but the _[[spells/Spark|spark]]_ of undeath is a feast for their every sense, and they pursue and ravenously consume undead creatures at every opportunity.

Esoboks’ unruly nature and limited intelligence make them ideal border guards and “attack animals,” although their behavior can be alien and unsettling to those who expect them to display either more animalistic instincts or the sophisticated intellects of other psychopomps. These predators are never trusted to retrieve the souls of the _[[monsters/Fallen|fallen]]_, but they are often _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ to the Material Plane to help contain outbreaks of undead—in such situations, their joy at the taste of undead flesh generally prevents them from attacking living targets, despite their lust for battle.

Some psychopomps (particularly vanths; Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 221) have developed methods of _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ esoboks to realize greater potentials, allowing the creatures to tap into newfound reservoirs of magical ability. These trained esoboks have the advanced creature simple template and gain access to the following _spell-like abilities_, each usable once per day: _[[spells/Ear-Piercing Scream|ear-piercing scream]]_, _[[spells/Haunting Mists|haunting mists]]_, and teleport. The typical esobok stands 3 feet tall at the shoulder, is nearly as wide, and weighs upward of 300 pounds.
