desc_long: The word “havero” has its roots in ancient Thassilonian, roughly translating
  into “smothering arms.” The creature itself was first described in notes and theories
  postulated by ancient students of the stars and delvers into dark lore. Horrifically,
  haveros are not the mere imaginings of those sages who chronicle the heavens. They
  are entities of deepest blackness, and on terrible occasions a lone havero has been
  drawn to Golarion, putting all the races of the world into reach of its endless,
  ruinous arms.
