  Gale (Su): A tempest behemoth can generate winds of up to hurricane force as a free
    action, blowing in as many as three different directions at once. The winds blow
    either away from or directly toward the behemoth in a 30-foot-wide path that extends
    for 1,000 feet.
  Scales (Ex): A tempest behemoth can hurl up to six scales from its wings (range
    increment 100 feet) as a standard action.
  Thunderbolt (Su): As a swift action once every 1d4 rounds, a behemoth can shoot
    a bolt of lightning that deals 15d6 points of electricity damage and 15d6 points
    of sonic damage, and that causes permanent deafness in a 200-foot line (DC 34
    Reflex save halves damage and negates deafness). The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
  Riding the winds on a triple set of wings, tempest behemoths fly above all, death riding in their shadows. In battle, they snatch up foes only to cast them away from great heights, smash enemies with their wings, or hurl razor-edged scales at distant targets. A tempest behemoth's divine heritage wards its body, mind, and soul against harm. Only the most powerful magic or attack can pierce its defenses. Serene in their immortality, tempest behemoths fear no other being.

  As living forces of divine retribution, tempest behemoths are sent forth into the world to raze far-flung cities, ravage towns with mighty storms, level remote mountain temples, and tear apart siege fortresses impregnable from the ground.

  The advent of a tempest behemoth is generally presaged by foul weather and terrific storms that drive flocks of birds before their headwinds. The day before the behemoth arrives, the storms suddenly abate-ironically encouraging victims to emerge into the open just as the behemoth strikes.

##### Description

Riding the winds on a triple set of wings, tempest behemoths fly above all, death riding in their shadows. In battle, they _snatch_ up foes only to cast them away from great heights, _[[feats/Smash|smash]]_ enemies with their wings, or hurl razor-edged scales at distant targets. A tempest behemoth’s divine heritage wards its body, mind, and soul against _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_. Only the most powerful magic or attack can pierce its defenses. Serene in their immortality, tempest behemoths _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ no other being.

As living forces of divine _[[spells/Retribution|retribution]]_, tempest behemoths are sent forth into the world to raze far-flung cities, ravage towns with mighty storms, level remote mountain temples, and tear apart siege fortresses impregnable from the ground.

The advent of a tempest behemoth is generally presaged by foul weather and terrific storms that drive flocks of birds before their headwinds. The day before the behemoth arrives, the storms suddenly abate—ironically encouraging victims to emerge into the open just as the behemoth strikes.
