desc_short: A skeleton clad in tarnished armor clatters in its grim march. A polished
  bronze breastplate, greaves, and helmet dutifully remain to protect this felled
  warrior, while its naked, skeletal hands still clutch a short spear and a round
  bronze shield. Yet, beneath its decrepit armor and moldering bones, a deftness and
  deadly intent linger on, embodied in a hellish light smoldering in its shadowed
  eye sockets.

    tarnished weaponry. While in this state, the undead gains a +8 racial bonus to
    its Stealth check and its DR rises to 10/bludgeoning. As a move action, a spartolos
    can reform itself, jolting into its armored skeletal form even if its pieces have
    been scattered.
  United Resistance (Su): A spartolos ignores 5 points of damage caused by channel
    energy. This resistance rises by 5 for every other spartolos within 10 feet to
    a minimum of 0 damage.

Yet what sets them apart from lesser undead are their retained caginess and knowledge of tactics, allowing them to function with deadly efficiency in troops of their brethren. Sometimes called the “sown men,” spartoi hold a fundamental connection to the near-mythical magical items known as a spartoi seeds, teeth that when planted in the earth summon forth these undead, fully armed and ready for command. Although ancient versions of these items prove especially rare, the well-known nature of their myth has led to dozens of modern versions being created and, with them, a rise in the appearance of spartoi.

  A typical spartolos stands about 5-1/2 to 6-1/2 feet tall, weighing approximately 70 pounds with its full compliment of equipment.

##### Description

Raised from the corpses of famed warriors and legendary legionaries, spartoi (singular “_spartolos_”) walk again, dragged from death to do battle once more. Greater than mere unthinking corpses, like skeletal champions spartoi carry with them some vestige of their past lives and experiences. Yet what sets them apart from lesser undead are their retained caginess and knowledge of tactics, allowing them to function with _deadly_ efficiency in troops of their brethren. Sometimes _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ the “sown men,” spartoi hold a fundamental connection to the near-mythical magical items known as a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Spartoi Seeds|spartoi seeds]]_, teeth that when planted in the earth _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ forth these undead, fully armed and ready for _[[spells/Command|command]]_. Although ancient versions of these items prove especially rare, the well-known nature of their myth has led to dozens of modern versions being created and, with them, a rise in the appearance of spartoi.

A typical _spartolos_ stands about 5-1/2 to 6-1/2 feet tall, weighing approximately 70 pounds with its full compliment of equipment.
