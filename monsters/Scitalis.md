pattern, causing all creatures within 60 feet of it that can

reduces the duration to 1 round. This is a poison effect. The

save DC is Constitution based.

##### Description

Scitalises are horned dragons with long, ophidian

bodies; beautiful, many-colored frills; and thin,

tapered horns. Their heavy scales have an elliptical

shape, and grow ragged and thicker as the scitalises age.

A _scitalis_ glows from within, its scales and frill lighting up

like a stained-glass window and projecting mesmerizing

patterns that the dragon uses while hunting.

Scitalises covet territory and food more than the gold

and gems that true dragons prize. They live in caves, forest

grottoes, and rocky crags, and mark their territories with a

combination of musk and their sour, bile-scented sedative.

Scitalises often range up to 5 miles from their nests every

few days to hunt large herd animals and livestock. Lacking

forelegs with which to tear apart a meal, scitalises allow their

kills to ripen for a day or so in their lairs before eating them.

They keep some treasure and can be bribed, burying what

they do attain in the walls and f loors of their nests.

Scitalises lay clutches of one to three eggs, and males and

females share duties _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Guarding|guarding]]_ the nest. The pair remains

together until the juveniles reach maturity after 2 years.

These eggs sell for 5,000 gp in large cities, and juveniles

can _[[spells/Command|command]]_ prices of 8,000 gp. Scitalises coexist with

wyverns, but detest basilisks and griffons, which regularly

devour the scitalises’ eggs when they run across them.

An average _scitalis_ is between 14 and 18 feet long and

weighs approximately 2,500 pounds.
