### Special Abilities

**Mold Symbiosis (Ex)** A _[[monsters/Moldwretch|moldwretch]]_ forms bonds with mold hazards by spending time within their areas of effect. A _moldwretch_ can bond with only one mold at a time, and the symbiotic bond forms only after the _moldwretch_ spends 8 hours in contact with the hazard. A _moldwretch_ is immune to fungal hazards. Three example mold symbiosis effects are detailed below.

Brown Mold: The _moldwretch_ is immune to fire, and fire-based attacks restore a number of hit points to it equal to half the damage the attacks would normally deal. Its spores deal 2d6 points of cold damage.

Russet Mold: The _moldwretch_’s spores expose targets to the effects of russet mold (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 273).

Yellow Mold: The _moldwretch_’s spores expose targets to the effects of yellow mold (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 416).
**Spores (Ex)** A _moldwretch_’s tentacle and spore launch attacks expose their targets to the creature’s spores, which have an effect linked to the _moldwretch_’s mold symbiosis. A successful DC 19 Fortitude save negates the additional effect of a _moldwretch_’s spores. The save DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

While they are usually reclusive and aren’t actively _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Malevolent|malevolent]]_, moldwretches often come into conflict with adventurers who clear away patches of mold during dungeon exploration. They get along well with vegepygmies, but loathe and _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ fungus queens (see page 130). A _moldwretch_ is only 3 feet tall but is very dense and weighs 120 pounds.
