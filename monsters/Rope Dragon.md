### Special Abilities

**Corded Breath (Su)** A _[[monsters/Rope Dragon|rope dragon]]_’s _breath weapon_ is a cone

of abrasive filaments. Any target that fails its Reflex save

against the dragon’s breath suffers whiplike cuts and is

_[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_. The filaments _[[universal monster rules/Attach|attach]]_ to nearby

surfaces, causing the _entangled_ creature to

be stuck in place. An _entangled_ creature

can free itself with a successful

Strength check against the breath

weapon’s DC as a full-round

action or by dealing 10 points of

slashing damage to the clinging

strands. The strands become

brittle and fall away from their

target in 1d4 rounds.

**Discorporating Coils (Su)** As a standard

action, a _rope dragon_ can change its shape into what

appears to be a coil of rope. In this form, it loses its fly

speed and its base land speed drops to 5 feet. It can use its

bite and tail slap attacks—both with a reach of 10 feet—but

has no claws. A successful Perception check against the

_rope dragon_’s Stealth check reveals the coiled rope to be

alive, with the dragon’s shape visible within, but while

staying still in this form, the _rope dragon_ receives a +20

bonus on Stealth checks to hide among or appear to be

ordinary rope. A _rope dragon_ can resume its dragon form as

a free action.

##### Description

The _rope dragon_ is a strange and capricious shapeshifting

trickster that sneaks about, disguising itself as and hiding

among ordinary rope. Rope dragons most commonly use

their abilities to sneak into bakeries, confectionaries, and

the food stores of the wealthy in order to steal sweet and

expensive foods and escape undetected. A _rope dragon_

reserves its other main use of its shapeshifting talents—

setting up pranks and traps—for those who attempt to

seek out or capture it, usually after the dragon has had its

way with their pantries. Those who offer food willingly

to a _rope dragon_, or at least don’t mind the dragon’s

pilfering ways, are rarely the victims of the dragon’s

whimsy, and may find that when their lives or livelihoods

are truly threatened, their small _[[spells/Draconic Ally|draconic ally]]_ uses its

tricks and traps to protect them.

Rope dragons rarely interact with their own kind

except to mate, but they sometimes grow curious about

other places and sneak along with travelers, wanderers,

or adventurers by pretending to be part of that most

iconic piece of adventuring gear: the 50-foot rope. While

this may cause the _rope dragon_’s unwitting transporter

to experience an inexplicably dwindling food supply, in

the end, a _rope dragon_ doesn’t want to be left in some

monster’s lair. The carrier of a _rope dragon_ is in for a

real surprise when she gets into a f ight that she can’t

win on her own and her rope comes to life to assist

in fending off the monster. Rope dragons dislike it

when other creatures become aware of their existence,

however, so a _rope dragon_ abandons such an adventurer

at the first opportunity.
