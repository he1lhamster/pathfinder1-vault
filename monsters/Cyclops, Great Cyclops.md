special_abilities:
  Contemptuous Toss (Ex): When a mythic great cyclops uses Awesome Blow and expends
    a use of mythic power, its target flies up to 60 additional feet and takes 1d6
    points of damage for every additional 20 feet traveled. If the cyclops uses its
    gore attack for this ability, it can hurl the target up to 60 feet upward instead
    of sideways.
  Earthquake (Su): A mythic great cyclops can punch the ground and expend two uses
    of mythic power to cause an earthquake (as the spell). Add the cyclops's rank
    to the save DCs for the earthquake's effects. Other mythic great cyclopes are
    not affected by the earthquake.
  Flash of Brutality (Su): Once per day as a swift action, a great cyclops can gain
    a burst of savage inspiration. When it does, it doubles the threat range of all
    weapons, natural attacks, and rocks it attacks with until the start of its next
    turn. Once per day, when the cyclops reaches 0 or fewer hit points and is conscious
    because of its Diehard feat, this ability recharges, allowing it to use the ability
    a second time that same day.
desc_long: Mythic great cyclopes are the first and oldest of their kind to succumb
  to visions of rage and destruction. Said to be the lost offspring of gods of lightning
  and the forge, they wield power over earth and energy, using it to blast open humanoid
  defenses so they can pluck out the tasty morsels within.

### Special Abilities

**Flash of Brutality (Su)** Once per day as a swift action, a great _cyclops_ can gain a burst of savage of inspiration. When it does, it doubles the threat range of all weapons, _[[universal monster rules/Natural Attacks|natural attacks]]_, and rock attacks it makes until the start of its next turn. Furthermore, once per day, when the great _cyclops_ reaches 0 or fewer hit points and is conscious because of its _Diehard_ feat, this ability recharges, allowing it to use the ability a second time that same day.

##### Description

Degenerate giants of cyclops-kind, the legendary great cyclopes embody the _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ and dark _[[spells/Doom|doom]]_ of this race of uncanny seers. In their eyes blaze endless possibilities for bloodshed and terror, their myopic gazes _[[spells/Seeming|seeming]]_ to _[[spells/Witness|witness]]_ the potential for infinite deaths and devastations hidden within each moment. Gigantic but dull-witted, these massive savages are usually loners, but occasionally either need or fate drives them to rampages from which few are safe. Such undeniable force brings with it a dread that, in many instances, grows to reverence, giving rise to strange cults that cloak these cyclopes with veils of menace and dark legends.

Denizens of remote and primeval parts of the world, great cyclopes typically dwell in lands where none might intrude upon them—deserted islands, high craggy mountains, and _[[feats/Stoic|stoic]]_ hill countries often provide the great caves they favor as lairs. While most avoid well-traveled or populated lands, spending much of their time hunting megafauna and even monstrous prey in the wilds, some, driven by hunger or a desperation to wander, seek out the paths and settlements of humanoids, finding that their fragile buildings are easily shattered and that the mewling creatures make savory meals.

The average great _cyclops_ stands approximately 30 feet tall and weighs upward of 4 tons, though individuals of significantly greater size are known.
