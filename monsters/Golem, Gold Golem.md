  Death Throes (Ex): A gold golem melts into worthless slag when destroyed, releasing
    a 10-foot-radius cloud of fumes that deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage to
    all creatures within a 10-foot radius. A successful DC 21 Fortitude save negates
    this effect. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Immunity to Magic (Ex): A gold golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability
    that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
    differently against the creature, as noted below. • A magical attack that deals
    fire damage reduces the golem's DR to 5/adamantine but also hastens it for 1d6
    rounds as per the spell haste, with no saving throw. • A magical attack that deals
    cold damage slows a gold golem for 1d6 rounds as per the spell slow, with no saving
    throw.
  Prismatic Surge (Su): |-
    As a swift action when it hits a foe with its slam attack, a gold golem unleashes a ray of prismatic energy from its bejeweled scepter. It can choose to automatically hit the foe it hit with its slam attack with this ray, or it can target another creature within 30 feet as a +26 ranged touch attack. Roll 1d6 for any creature struck by a ray, and consult the following table to determine the effects. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

  Gold golems are extravagant constructs, crafted at great expense at the command of the rich and powerful. They're most often used to guard palaces and family vaults, but are rarely placed in areas that are hidden away from casual observation. 

  Many of those who expend the funds to create a gold golem aren't the type to hide the conspicuous display of their wealth from their visitors. A gold golem is humanoid in appearance, standing 10 feet tall and weighing 4,500 pounds.
