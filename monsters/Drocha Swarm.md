  Ghost Touch Jaws (Su): A drocha swarm's many biting jaws are considered to have
    the ghost touch special ability. This allows it to deal its swarm damage to corporeal
    foes, and to deal normal damage to incorporeal creatures such as ghosts, shadow
    demons, and even other drocha swarms.
  Project Death (Su): As a standard action, a drocha swarm can target a creature within
    30 feet and cry mournful wails that fill the listener with images of its own death.
    The targeted creature must succeed at a DC 18 Will save to steel itself against
    this morbid onslaught. If that save fails, the victim must succeed at a Fortitude
    save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save succeeds, the victim takes 4d6
    points of damage. A creature that successfully saves against the initial Will
    save is not subject to the same drocha swarm's project death ability for 24 hours.
    This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

  The opening of the Worldwound brought many horrors to the world, and one of the more tragic and horrible results was the elimination of the Sarkorian people. The mass deaths of these people spawned roiling clouds of unquiet spirits called drocha swarms.

Their lives were cut short either by the ripping open of the terrain itself or by the demons that subsequently poured forth from the Abyss. Now, these tortured swarms of spirits roam the Worldwound, alone or in packs. Drocha swarms are devoid of the goodliness and respect for nature they had in life. All these tortured souls can do is scream and torment others, and though incorporeal, their razor-sharp teeth materialize just long enough to tear at any creatures they happen across.

  Mostly translucent, drocha swarms contain only the faintest traces of black and green delineating the writhing mouths and rolling eyes of the faces within. The faces moan independently, creating a cacophony of voices, each shouting rage at its death or screaming for others to listen to the story of its plight. It would be maddening to pick out individual voices and follow their terrible cries. The swarm can expand and contract as necessary, pouring over enemies and draining them of the life drocha swarms were so violently denied, an action that does not seem to bring the pitiful creatures any relief from their hideous afterlife.

### Special Abilities

**_Ghost Touch_ Jaws (Su)** A _[[monsters/Drocha Swarm|drocha swarm]]_’s many biting jaws are considered to have the _ghost touch_ special ability. This allows it to deal its swarm damage to corporeal foes, and to deal normal damage to _incorporeal_ creatures such as ghosts, _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Shadow|shadow]]_ demons, and even other drocha swarms.

**Project Death (Su)** As a standard action, a _drocha swarm_ can target a creature within 30 feet and cry mournful wails that fill the listener with images of its own death. The targeted creature must succeed at a DC 18 Will save to steel itself against this morbid _[[feats/Onslaught|onslaught]]_. If that save fails, the victim must succeed at a Fortitude save or die from _fear_. Even if the Fortitude save succeeds, the victim takes 4d6 points of damage. A creature that successfully saves against the initial Will save is not subject to the same _drocha swarm_’s project death ability for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting _fear_ effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

##### Description

The opening of the Worldwound brought many horrors to the world, and one of the more tragic and horrible results was the elimination of the Sarkorian people. The mass deaths of these people spawned roiling clouds of unquiet spirits _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ drocha swarms. Each made of the spirits of hundreds of Sarkorians who died at once, these ghostly swarms reveal the screaming faces of those who once lived and thrived in this verdant land. Their lives were cut short either by the ripping open of the terrain itself or by the demons that subsequently poured forth from the Abyss. Now, these tortured swarms of spirits roam the Worldwound, alone or in packs. Drocha swarms are devoid of the goodliness and respect for nature they had in life. All these tortured souls can do is scream and torment others, and though _incorporeal_, their razor-sharp teeth materialize just long enough to tear at any creatures they happen across.

Mostly translucent, drocha swarms contain only the faintest traces of black and green delineating the writhing mouths and rolling eyes of the faces within. The faces moan independently, creating a cacophony of voices, each shouting _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ at its death or screaming for others to listen to the story of its plight. It would be maddening to pick out individual voices and follow their terrible cries. The swarm can expand and contract as necessary, pouring over enemies and draining them of the life drocha swarms were so violently denied, an action that does not seem to bring the pitiful creatures any relief from their hideous afterlife.
