  Level Adjustment +4 (cohort)Special AbilitiesDrink the Wind (Su) Once per day, a buraq may fill its lungs with air and release an explosive gust of wind in a line 150 feet long. Any creature caught by the wind takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage and is affected by windstorm-strength winds, possibly suffering other effects (see page 95 of the DMG). A DC 18 Reflex save negates both the damage and the effects of the wind. The save DC is Constitution-based.

  Shimmering Wings (Su) A buraq can flutter its iridescent wings to create a pattern of subtle, shifting colors around its body. Any creature within 60 feet who can see the buraq must make a DC 17 Will save or be fascinated for 2d4 rounds. A creature that makes the save is immune to the shimmering wings of that buraq for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting pattern and affects up to 24 HD of creatures. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

  Static Field (Su) Three times per day, a buraq can surround itself (and its rider, if any) with a coruscating aura of static electricity that deflects Medium or smaller ranged attacks. This ability functions like an entropic shield and lasts for 1 minute.

  Fold the Earth (Su) Once per day, a buraq can transport itself over great distances. This functions as a teleport spell (caster level 6th) with the usual chances of success or mishap. However, a buraq can teleport itself to any location that it can see (usually as far as the horizon, or approximately 200 miles) as if that location were “studied carefully.”DescriptionBuraqs are a race of good and noble creatures that sometimes serve as steeds to devout servants of the celestial realms. Related to lammasus, buraqs are also known for their great wisdom. Those seeking divine insight often climb high mountains to petition buraqs to impart their great knowledge, while pious warriors in search of a companion as pure in heart as themselves might endeavor to claim a buraq as a mount.

  A buraq has an equine body with a pure white coat, but instead of a horse's head and neck it has a human head with bronzed skin and thick black hair. Male buraqs have a man's face and favor full beards, while female buraqs have a woman's face and often wear silken veils. Buraqs of both sexes have the brightly colored tail and wings of a peacock, with a 20-foot wingspan. A typical adult buraq is the size of a mule or light horse, about 5 feet high at the shoulder and 8 feet long, and weighs between 1,000 and 1,200 pounds. Females are slightly smaller and slimmer than males. The average lifespan of a buraq is about 200 years, although some particularly wise specimens have lived over 500 years.

##### Description

Buraqs are a race of good and noble creatures that sometimes serve as steeds to devout servants of the celestial realms. Related to lammasus, buraqs are also known for their great wisdom. Those seeking divine insight often _[[universal monster rules/Climb|climb]]_ high mountains to petition buraqs to impart their great knowledge, while pious warriors in search of a companion as pure in heart as themselves might endeavor to claim a _buraq_ as a _mount_.

A _buraq_ has an equine body with a pure white coat, but instead of a _[[monsters/Horse|horse]]_’s head and neck it has a human head with bronzed skin and thick black hair. Male buraqs have a man’s face and favor full beards, while female buraqs have a woman’s face and often wear silken veils. Buraqs of both sexes have the brightly colored tail and wings of a peacock, with a 20-foot wingspan. A typical adult _buraq_ is the size of a mule or light _horse_, about 5 feet high at the shoulder and 8 feet long, and weighs between 1,000 and 1,200 pounds. Females are slightly smaller and slimmer than males. The average lifespan of a _buraq_ is about 200 years, although some particularly wise specimens have lived over 500 years.
