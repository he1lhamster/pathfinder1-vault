  Bury Alive (Su): As a standard action, Gravedragger can telekinetically pull a target
    within 100 feet into a grave (or a similar physical hole in the ground that is
    an appropriate size for burying the target) and bury it. Gravedragger must be
    adjacent to the grave he intends to drag his target into. Treat this as a special
    drag combat maneuver. The target takes 4d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 22 half)
    and is buried alive (see Cave-Ins and Collapses on page 415 of the Pathfinder
    RPG Core Rulebook). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Long Arm of the Reaper (Ex): Gravedragger can throw his heavy pick up to 100 feet
    away as a ranged attack with no range increment. The weapon automatically returns
    just before the herald's next turn, as if it had the returning weapon quality.
  Unearthly Luck (Su): Gravedragger adds his Charisma bonus as a luck bonus on all
    his saving throws and to his Armor Class.
  Unluck Aura (Su): Gravedragger radiates an aura of unluck to a radius of 30 feet.
    Any creature in this area must roll two d20s whenever a situation calls for a
    d20 roll (such as an attack roll, a skill check, or a saving throw) and must use
    the lower of the two results. This is a mind-affecting effect that doesn't work
    on worshipers of Zyphus. Any creature that gains any sort of luck bonus (such
    as that granted by a luckstone or divine favor) is immune to Gravedragger's unluck
    aura.
desc_long: |-
  Gravedragger is a cruel prankster who enjoys murdering innocents in unexpected, horrid, ironic, and tragic ways. In the same way that children fear the mysterious bogeymen, adults cower at the thought of Gravedragger bringing them to a painful end. Unlike Pharasma, who enforces fated and inevitable death, the herald of Zyphus is a break from destiny's plan-a sudden deviation that leads to danger and ruin. Gravedragger appears as a vaguely humanoid mass of grave dirt and bones, and wields a heavy pick made of a rib bone punched through a giant's skull. He also takes the form of an old, thin human man with shifty eyes and a sickening, toothy smile. In this form he is known as “Grinning Jack,” often shortened to “Grinjack.” Gravedragger speaks in a high, mad voice, and is prone to outbursts of cackling even when cloaked by invisibility.

  Divinations by the faithful show that Gravedragger was once a mortal farmer. When his wife and family fell ill with a sickness, he traveled to the nearest village to get aid from the healer. When he returned with a curative potion, he found that his home had been struck by lightning and burned to the ground; his family, too sick to crawl out, had perished in the fire. The man's mind snapped, broken by the idea that he could have prevented his loved ones' random and pointless deaths if he hadn't been away from home. He embraced the cult of Zyphus and began studying magic, using his abilities to stalk and kill clerics of rival faiths as well as to ambush adventurers to slay them in their sleep or after difficult battles. After a long, successful life at this morbid career, he died in his sleep, and in Zyphus's realm he was infused with divine power and became the god's herald. Remorseless and vindictive, Gravedigger now enjoys his role as the bringer of bad luck and the foil of fate, and every death he causes buries a little bit deeper the guilt he feels for his family's deaths.

  Although Gravedragger enjoys lurking in graveyards, where he can easily use his bury alive ability, he isn't a harbinger of deserved deaths and is bored by the idea of dispatching wounded soldiers-something he feels is the job of psychopomps. Instead, Gravedragger revels in unexpected methods of murder, such as causing a fallen armored knight to drown in a couple inches of mud after being pulled from his horse.

  The herald uses invisibility and greater invisibility to sneak up on his targets and afflict them with curses or blindness, blow them off cliffs (with gust of wind or telekinesis), call sudden bolts of lightning, or create symptomless deaths (using slay living). He might attack from invisibility for 1 or 2 rounds, then leave if he fails to kill anyone quickly-his interest is in spontaneity and sudden death, not extended battle. He usually employs these tactics even if tasked with slaying a specific person, as it's more entertaining to him to set up an elaborate ambush than to confront his opponent directly. Sometimes he's content to just follow his prey unobserved, creepily breaking the silence with his tittering laugh and unnerving the victim so much that it stumbles into a natural trap or flees in terror toward a wild creature's lair.
