  Daemonic Pact (Su): Urdefhans are infused with daemonic energy; as an immediate
    action, an urdefhan can attempt to allow this energy to consume its soul (50%
    chance of success per attempt). If it succeeds, the urdefhan dies and releases
    a 5-foot-radius burst of negative energy that deals 2d6 points of damage (DC 14
    Reflex half). The save DC is Con-based.
  Strength Damage (Su): An urdefhan's bite drains vitality, turning the skin and muscle
    around the wound transparent and causing 2 points of Strength damage unless the
    target succeeds on a DC 14 Fortitude save. The flesh remains transparent until
    the Strength damage is healed, but this does not have any other effects. The save
    DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: Infused with fell energies from Abaddon, urdefhans are an unsightly race
  dedicated to war. They have developed many strange weapons, but none are more iconic
  than the two-bladed rhoka sword. Rhoka swords are exotic one-handed melee weapons-all
  urdefhans are proficient in their use. With such weapons, an urdefhan seeks to inflict
  as much death as possible upon the world before it perishes, so that its daemonic
  lords are pleased. Most male urdefhans are sterile-as a result, the women often
  turn to conjured daemons for mates. The products of such unions are usually typical
  urdefhans, but sometimes result in half-fiend urdefhans-these monsters usually rise
  to positions of great power in their violent society.

##### Description

Infused with fell energies from Abaddon, urdefhans are an unsightly race dedicated to war. They have developed many strange weapons, but none are more iconic than the two-bladed _rhoka sword_. Rhoka swords are exotic one-handed melee weapons—all urdefhans are proficient in their use. With such weapons, an _urdefhan_ seeks to inflict as much death as possible upon the world before it perishes, so that its daemonic lords are pleased. Most male urdefhans are sterile—as a result, the women often turn to conjured daemons for mates. The products of such unions are usually typical urdefhans, but sometimes result in half-fiend urdefhans—these monsters usually rise to positions of great power in their violent society.
