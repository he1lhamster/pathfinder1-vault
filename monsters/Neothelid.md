# Neothelid
Its slime-drenched length coiled upon itself in a shuddering mountain, this huge worm’s tentacled head rises like a snake’s.

### Special Abilities

**Mind Thrust (Su)** As a standard action up to three times a day, a _[[monsters/Neothelid|neothelid]]_ can deliver a massive blast of mental energy at any one target within 60 feet, inflicting 15d10 points of damage. A successful DC 25 Will save negates the effect. This effect can only _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ creatures with Intelligence scores. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**_Psychic_ Crush (Su)** As a standard action up to three times a day, a _neothelid_ can attempt to crush the mind of a single creature within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 25 Will save or collapse, becoming _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_ and _[[conditions/Dying|dying]]_ at –1 hit points. If the target succeeds on the save, it takes 6d6 points of damage and is _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**_Trace Teleport_ (Ex)** A _neothelid_ telepathically and reflexively learns the mental coordinates of the destination, of all creatures that teleport within 60 feet of it, gaining an awareness of the location equivalent to “seen casually.” This knowledge fades and is lost after 1 minute. This power does not grant any environmental information about the conditions of the destination.

##### Description

Dwelling only in the deepest reaches of the underworld, the immense neothelids once ruled empires in the depths, yet their numbers have been vastly reduced as other races have proven swifter to breed and adapt. Today, the _neothelid_ is a legend, the subject of tales of horror among those few to have experienced the creature’s wrath in person and lived to tell about it.

Neothelids are served by all manner of strange worm-like creatures, minions they use to observe and wage war against their enemies. The neothelids themselves were spawned by even more horrific entities, ageless horrors from strange dimensions beyond the edge of known reality—the neothelids see themselves as the chosen agents of these _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Malevolent|malevolent]]_ forces, working to ready the world for their return.
