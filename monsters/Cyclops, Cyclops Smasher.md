  The cyclopes' decline from greatness is not a finished fact of history but an ongoing process, and some among them creep closer to animalistic fury. The smashers epitomize this descent, clothing themselves in rough hides and living as nomadic predators. Filled with rage and a total rejection of everything their people once achieved, these massive brutes experience incredible joy in destroying the works of civilization. They tear down homes and buildings, rip out orchards, slaughter livestock, and crush forges. The ruins of their own peoples' grandeur drive them into a frenzy, and smashers may spend weeks or months ripping down the remains of cyclopean temples or cities, crushing even the bricks themselves into gravel. Their disdain for manufactured goods doesn't stop them from using weapons, armor, or other useful items, however.

  These one-eyed barbarians engage strangers with some degree of tactics and insight born of their prophetic talent. They tame mastodons and other massive beasts as mounts, and are skilled at leaving false trails that lead pursuers into an ambush. The smashers' favorite tactic is to battle indoors or among ruins and destroy supports until the structure collapses around them, trusting their phenomenal strength to save them from destruction.

##### Description

The cyclopes’ decline from greatness is not a finished fact of history but an ongoing process, and some among them creep closer to animalistic fury. The smashers epitomize this descent, clothing themselves in rough hides and living as nomadic predators. Filled with _rage_ and a total rejection of everything their people once achieved, these massive brutes experience incredible joy in destroying the works of civilization. They tear down homes and buildings, rip out orchards, slaughter livestock, and crush forges. The ruins of their own peoples’ grandeur drive them into a frenzy, and smashers may spend weeks or months ripping down the remains of cyclopean temples or cities, crushing even the bricks themselves into gravel. Their disdain for manufactured goods doesn’t stop them from using weapons, armor, or other useful items, however.

These one-eyed barbarians engage strangers with some degree of tactics and insight born of their prophetic talent. They tame mastodons and other massive beasts as mounts, and are skilled at leaving false trails that lead pursuers into an ambush. The smashers’ favorite tactic is to battle indoors or among ruins and destroy supports until the structure collapses around them, trusting their phenomenal strength to save them from _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_.
