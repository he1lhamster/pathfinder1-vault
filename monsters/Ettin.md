  Two Brains (Ex): Anytime a mythic ettin attempts a Will saving throw, it rolls twice

desc_long: A mythic ettin is descended from a sordid lineage of mythic hill giants,
  mythic stone giants, and at least one mythic orc. Angrier, filthier, and stronger
  than other ettins, it is a leader of its kind, and is better at keeping a band or
  colony together for months or years.

### Special Abilities
**Superior _Two-Weapon Fighting_ (Ex) **An _[[monsters/Ettin|ettin]]_ fights with a flail or _[[items/Weapon/Javelin|javelin]]_ in each hand. Because each of its two heads controls an arm, the _ettin_ does not take a penalty on attack or damage rolls for attacking with two weapons.

##### Description

Ettins, or two-headed giants, are _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_ and unpredictable hunters that stalk the night. Their two heads provide them with unparalleled powers of perception, making them excellent guards.

Ettins superficially resemble hill or stone giants, although their tusked facial features betray _orc_ blood in their lineage. They have pinkish-brown skin, but ettins never bathe if they can help it, which usually leaves them so grimy and dirty their skin resembles thick, _[[monsters/Gray|gray]]_ hide. Adult ettins are about 13 feet tall and weigh 5,200 pounds. They live about 75 years.

Ettins have no language of their own but speak a pidgin of Giant, _Goblin_, and _Orc_. Creatures that can speak any of these languages must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence check to communicate with an _ettin_. Check once for each bit of information: if the other creature speaks two of these languages, the DC is 10, and for someone who speaks all three, the DC is 5.

Though ettins aren’t very intelligent, they are _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cunning|cunning]]_ fighters. They prefer to ambush their victims rather than charge into a fight, but once the battle has started, an _ettin_ fights furiously until all enemies are dead.

Ettins lead solitary lives, establishing lairs in secluded rocky caves and hollows, often surrounded by pits and trenches. Ettins sometimes keep cave bears as pets and guardians for their lairs.

A particularly powerful _ettin_ may attract a gang of a few followers, possibly with several _goblin_ or _orc_ allies. Such gatherings are the exception rather than the rule, however, and seldom last long, with individual ettins going their separate ways when opportunities for pillage and plunder decrease or if the leader is killed.

Mated couples usually come together to breed for only a short time before going off on their own again. Young ettins mature quickly, reaching adult size within a year, when they are kicked out to fend for themselves.
