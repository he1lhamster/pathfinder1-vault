  Change Size (Sp): Twice per day, a janni can magically change a creature's size.
    This works just like an enlarge person or reduce person spell (the janni chooses
    when using the ability), except that the ability can work on the janni. A DC 13
    Fortitude save negates the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is the
    equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.
  Elemental Endurance (Ex): Jann can remain on the Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or
    Water for up to 48 hours at a time. Failure to return to the Material Plane before
    that time expires causes a janni to take 1 point of damage per additional hour
    spent on the elemental plane, until it dies or returns to the Material Plane.
desc_long: |-
  The jann (singular janni) are the weakest of the genies. Jann are formed out of all four elements and must therefore spend most of their time on the Material Plane. Some lore even casts the janni as the most “human” of the genie races, although most jann are quick to correct this insult, usually with the edge of a sword. A janni is human-sized, standing about 6 feet tall and weighing about 180 pounds.

  Jann are physically strong and courageous, and do not take kindly to insult or injury. Most are quite prone to seeing insult even when none is intended by the speaker. If overwhelmed in battle, they escape using flight and invisibility, returning later with reinforcements.

  Jann enjoy their privacy, preferring the solitude of the deep desert and isolated oases. They are usually suspicious of humans, but are often willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Jann have a strong cultural tradition of hospitality, and will never turn away someone in need of food, water, or shelter, though they might expect payment in the form of a favor at some later date.

  Among the other genie races, jann generally have good relations with both djinn and shaitans. While not actively enemies, jann dislike the proud and aloof marids. Jann have a distinct aversion to the efreet, who often try to enslave them or conscript them into their armies.

  A small percentage of jann are noble. Noble jann, often called sheikhs or amirs, have 9 Hit Dice, Strength 19, and Intelligence 18, and gain the following spell-like abilities: 3/day-augury, detect magic, and divination. A noble janni's caster level for its spell-like abilities is 12th. Noble jann are CR 7.

##### Description

The jann (singular janni) are the weakest of the genies. Jann are formed out of all four elements and must therefore spend most of their time on the Material Plane. Some lore even casts the janni as the most “human” of the genie races, although most jann are quick to correct this insult, usually with the edge of a sword. A janni is human-sized, standing about 6 feet tall and weighing about 180 pounds.

Jann are physically strong and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Courageous|courageous]]_, and do not take kindly to insult or injury. Most are quite _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ to seeing insult even when none is intended by the speaker. If overwhelmed in battle, they escape using _[[universal monster rules/Flight|flight]]_ and _invisibility_, returning later with reinforcements.

Jann enjoy their privacy, preferring the solitude of the deep desert and isolated oases. They are usually suspicious of humans, but are often willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Jann have a strong cultural tradition of hospitality, and will never turn away someone in need of food, water, or shelter, though they might expect payment in the form of a favor at some later date.

Among the other genie races, jann generally have good relations with both djinn and shaitans. While not actively enemies, jann dislike the proud and aloof marids. Jann have a distinct _[[spells/Aversion|aversion]]_ to the efreet, who often try to enslave them or conscript them into their armies.

A small percentage of jann are noble. Noble jann, often _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ sheikhs or amirs, have 9 Hit Dice, Strength 19, and Intelligence 18, and gain the following _spell-like abilities_: 3/day—_[[spells/Augury|augury]]_, _[[spells/Detect Magic|detect magic]]_, and _[[spells/Divination|divination]]_. A noble janni’s caster level for its _spell-like abilities_ is 12th. Noble jann are CR 7.
