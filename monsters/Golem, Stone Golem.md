  Immunity to Magic (Ex): A stone golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability
    that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
    differently against the creature, as noted below. A transmute rock to mud spell
    slows a stone golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw,
    while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit points.A stone to flesh
    spell does not actually change the golem's structure but negates its damage reduction
    and immunity to magic for 1 full round.
  Slow (Su): A stone golem can use a slow effect, as the spell, as a free action once
    every 2 rounds. The effect has a range of 10 feet in a burst centered on the golem
    and a duration of 7 rounds, requiring a DC 17 Will save to negate. The save DC
    is Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
  A stone golem has a humanoid body made from stone, frequently stylized to suit its creator. For example, it might look like it is wearing armor, with a particular symbol carved on the breastplate, or have designs worked into the stone of its limbs. Its head is often carved to resemble a helmet or the head of some beast. While it may be sculpted to carry a stone shield or stone weapon such as a sword, these aesthetic choices do not affect its combat abilities.

  Like most golems, a stone golem cannot speak and makes no sound other than the grinding of stone against stone when it moves. A stone golem is 9 feet tall and weighs around 2,000 pounds.

##### Description

A stone golem has a humanoid body made from stone, frequently stylized to suit its creator. For example, it might look like it is wearing armor, with a particular symbol carved on the _[[items/Armor/Breastplate|breastplate]]_, or have designs worked into the stone of its limbs. Its head is often carved to resemble a helmet or the head of some beast. While it may be sculpted to carry a _[[spells/Stone Shield|stone shield]]_ or stone weapon such as a sword, these aesthetic choices do not affect its combat abilities.

Like most golems, a stone golem cannot speak and makes no sound other than the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Grinding|grinding]]_ of stone against stone when it moves. A stone golem is 9 feet tall and weighs around 2,000 pounds.
