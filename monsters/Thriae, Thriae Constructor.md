### Special Abilities

**Encase (Ex)** A thriae constructor

produces vast amounts of fastdrying,

_[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Adhesive|adhesive]]_ wax. A creature

hit by a thriae constructor’s

_sticky_ wax must succeed at

a DC 25 Reflex save or be

encased in a ball of wax. A

creature that succeeds at

its saving throw gains the

_[[conditions/Entangled|entangled]]_ condition,

but can otherwise act

normally. An encased

creature is _[[conditions/Pinned|pinned]]_ and

can’t use spells with

verbal components.

On the first round, an encased

creature can attempt to break

out by succeeding at a DC 25

Strength check. If it fails to escape, on all future rounds

the encased creature is _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ and can’t attempt to

escape. A creature that hits a ball of _sticky_ wax with a

natural attack must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save or

become stuck. A stuck creature can’t move away from the

ball of wax or use the stuck limb until it escapes, but can

otherwise act normally. If a creature strikes the ball of wax

with a manufactured weapon, it must succeed at a DC 25

Reflex save or the weapon becomes stuck. _Sticky_ wax has

hardness 5, has 100 hit points, and is vulnerable to fire. The

save DCs are Constitution-based.

**Merope _Consumption_ (Su)** Three times per day as a standard

action, a thriae constructor can consume a dose of merope to gain the ability to launch

its wax with crushing force for 1d4 rounds. Starting on the

round after the constructor consumes the merope, its _sticky_

wax attack deals 6d6+8 points damage on a successful hit, in

addition to the encase effect.

**Poison (Ex)** Sting—injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round

for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Str plus _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_; cure 2 consecutive

saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

Thriae _[[spells/Blend|blend]]_ the physical features of graceful

humanoid women with those of giant bees. For

the most part, they are a wise, knowledgeable,

and spiritual race. But unlike others of their

kind, thriae constructors are not philosophers

or seers; they are mindless laborers that

react by pure instinct. Despite their lack

of intelligence, however, these enormous

creatures possess an even more complex

sense of architecture and structure

than bees, and in some ways, their

architectural instincts surpass even the

greatest designs a human mind could

imagine. Other thriae, particularly

those of high rank, are adept at

directing thriae constructors to focus

on those jobs that will most benefit

the community and herding

them to their work. In times

of peace, thriae constructors

labor to build, expand, and

renovate hives and enhance

its fortifications. When a

thriae hive is threatened,

the constructors quickly

descend upon their foes,

encasing these enemies

in the same secretion of

_adhesive_ wax they normally use as

a material to build the hive, and

assailing resilient enemies with

numerous attacks and a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_ poison.

A typical thriae constructor is 18 feet tall with a

wingspan of 30 feet, and weighs about 5,500 pounds.
