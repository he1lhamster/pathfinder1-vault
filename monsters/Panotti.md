By flapping their ears, adult panotti can lift off, hover, and even fly. While in combat, a panotti can slam opponents with its ears to propel them away. Panotti's hearing is sharp enough to detect the presence of even an unseen adversary. Finally, panotti can wrap themselves up in their ears like a cocoon, staying warm on the coolest of nights. Some sages speculate the panotti originated in a kingdom that fell beneath a curse-though the panotti themselves deny it. The rare couplings between a human and a panotti usually result in panotti children. 

  Culturally, the panotti are a reclusive people, preferring the company of their own kind- mostly due to the reaction they receive from other humanoids. Nevertheless, panotti are not a cruel or unkind race, and their culture is rich with music and storytelling traditions. They adapt to most classes with ease, but favor bard, fighter, and ranger. Treated with respect and dignity, panotti can be generous and steadfast allies. When treated as laughingstocks, however, panotti can become fierce, and they're naturally hearty and capable warriors. 

  On Golarion, panotti live primarily in Casmaron and central Tian Xia, with a much smaller number residing in Avistan.

**Elephantine Ears (Ex)** A _[[monsters/Panotti|panotti]]_ can flap its huge ears to fly awkwardly. A _panotti_ can also wrap its ears around the length of its body for warmth and protection from the elements (similar to using a _[[items/Mundane/Bedroll|bedroll]]_ or heavy blankets), or use them as secondary _[[universal monster rules/Natural Attacks|natural attacks]]_ (as per wing attacks).

##### Description

The _panotti_ are a race of humanoids that strongly resemble humans except for one startling difference: their enormous ears. A _panotti_’s ears are attached to the side of their heads, like those of a human, but they remain connected to the body down to the neck. When at ease, the folds of their ears hang loosely, like an _[[monsters/Elephant|elephant]]_’s, but extend almost the length of their bodies. These sheets of hanging flesh and skin appear limp and superfluous, but appearances are _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Deceiving|deceiving]]_. _Panotti_ possess remarkably smooth muscle control along the upper ridges of their ears, allowing them to extend and control their ears at will.

Even though _panotti_ look ridiculous by most humanoid standards, the source of this ridicule offers them several distinct advantages. By flapping their ears, adult _panotti_ can lift off, _hover_, and even fly. While in combat, a _panotti_ can slam opponents with its ears to propel them away. _Panotti_’s hearing is sharp enough to detect the presence of even an _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Unseen|unseen]]_ adversary. Finally, _panotti_ can wrap themselves up in their ears like a cocoon, staying warm on the coolest of nights. Some sages speculate the _panotti_ originated in a kingdom that fell beneath a curse-though the _panotti_ themselves deny it. The rare couplings between a human and a _panotti_ usually result in _panotti_ children.

Culturally, the _panotti_ are a reclusive people, preferring the company of their own kind- mostly due to the reaction they receive from other humanoids. Nevertheless, _panotti_ are not a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_ or unkind race, and their culture is rich with music and storytelling traditions. They adapt to most classes with ease, but favor _[[classes/Bard|bard]]_, _[[classes/Fighter|fighter]]_, and _[[classes/Ranger|ranger]]_. Treated with respect and dignity, _panotti_ can be generous and steadfast allies. When treated as laughingstocks, however, _panotti_ can become fierce, and they’re naturally hearty and capable warriors.

On Golarion, _panotti_ live primarily in Casmaron and central Tian Xia, with a much smaller number residing in Avistan.
