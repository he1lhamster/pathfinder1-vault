  Implant (Ex): As a full-round action, an alpluachra can crawl into the mouth of
    a helpless creature (no more than three size categories larger than itself) and
    implant itself into the creature's throat. Once implanted, anything that the creature
    ingests is instead consumed by the alpluachra, including such substances as elixirs
    and potions or ingested alchemical items, diseases, drugs, or poisons. Once the
    alpluachra is implanted, the host creature begins suffering the effects of starvation
    and thirst (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444). Due in part to its numbing slime,
    an implanted alpluachra is difficult to detect. Each time the host creature ingests
    anything, it gains an automatic Perception check against the alpluachra's Stealth.
    After the newtlike fey is detected, it can be removed either by consuming at least
    half a pound of salt or a gallon of salt water, by a remove disease spell cast
    on the host creature, or by treating the host with a successful DC 15 Heal check.
    When a Heal check made for this purpose fails by 5 or more, the host creature
    takes 1d6 points of damage. If the host attempts to remove the alpluachra by eating
    salt or drinking salt water, it must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or become
    sickened for 1d8 hours from the reaction with the alpluachra. If the alpluachra
    dies or becomes unconscious, it is immediately detected by the host creature,
    and can be removed safely as a full-round action. While implanted, an alpluachra
    is considered helpless.
  Numbing Slime (Ex): Any creature that deals damage to an alpluachra with a natural
    attack or an unarmed strike, comes into contact with an alpluachra, or is host
    to an alpluachra must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or take a -4 penalty on
    all tactile Perception checks, as well as other skill checks requiring tactile
    senses (such as Disable Device and Sleight of Hand) for 24 hours. A host creature
    that fails this saving throw takes the penalty to detect the alpluachra implanted
    inside it. If the host creature succeeds at the saving throw, it can't be affected
    by the same alpluachra's numbing slime for another 24 hours.
  Vulnerable to Salt (Ex): Half a pound of salt or a gallon of salt water poured over
    an alpluachra or consumed by a creature an alpluachra has implanted itself in
    deals 1d3 points of damage to the alpluachra.
desc_long: |-
  These strange and insatiable fey prowl bubbling brooks, sauntering streams, and slow-moving rivers in a constant pursuit of food, but the extremely lazy creatures often tire of hunting. Alpluachras find it much easier to slip down a sleeping creature's throat, fall asleep, and dream of fantastic feasts and warm bubbling pools while its host does the eating for it. Because of this, alpluachras always keep an eye on riverbanks, looking for creatures napping near waterways. Once they find potential hosts, alpluachras stealthily slither up and slide down their snoring gullets.

  Once inside, an alpluachra rests along the walls of the esophagus and devours all the food that comes down the host's throat. The host often starves to death in the process, as the parasite becomes more ravenous over time.

  Despite their propensity to slowly kill their hosts, alpluachras are slothful rather than cruel. They have no concept of the harm they are doing, lazily enjoying the benefits while the host is still alive.

##### Description

These strange and insatiable fey prowl bubbling brooks, sauntering streams, and slow-moving rivers in a constant pursuit of food, but the extremely lazy creatures often tire of hunting. Alpluachras find it much easier to slip down a sleeping creature’s throat, fall asleep, and _[[spells/Dream|dream]]_ of fantastic feasts and warm bubbling pools while its host does the eating for it. Because of this, alpluachras always keep an eye on riverbanks, looking for creatures napping near waterways. Once they find potential hosts, alpluachras stealthily slither up and slide down their snoring gullets.

Once inside, an _alpluachra_ rests along the walls of the esophagus and devours all the food that comes down the host’s throat. The host often starves to death in the process, as the parasite becomes more _[[curses/Ravenous|ravenous]]_ over time.

Despite their propensity to slowly kill their hosts, alpluachras are slothful rather than _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_. They have no concept of the _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ they are doing, lazily enjoying the benefits while the host is still alive.
