  Enhance Weapon (Su): When initially created, a clockwork angel is granted the ability
    to infuse a single wielded masterwork melee weapon with magical power. The creator
    determines what sort of effects each clockwork angel can grant to its weapon,
    as long as the enhancements are equivalent to a +3 enhancement bonus. Most clockwork
    angels are granted the ability to transform a wielded weapon into a +1 flaming
    keen weapon. A clockwork angel can infuse a melee weapon it wields in this manner
    at will as a free action; it can have only one such weapon at a time, and the
    weapon loses its magical infusion and reverts to a masterwork weapon as soon as
    the clockwork angel drops it or is destroyed.
  Infused Heart (Su): A clockwork angel's mechanical heart is infused with a tiny
    mote of power siphoned from the Positive Energy Plane. This heart provides the
    clockwork angel a tiny spark of life, allowing it to apply its Charisma modifier
    as a bonus to its hit points per Hit Die (+80 hp total for the typical clockwork
    angel). A clockwork angel is healed by positive energy and harmed by negative
    energy as if it were a living creature.
  Programmed Sentinel (Ex): Although unintelligent, a clockwork angel is programmed
    upon creation with a wide range of weaponry skills. The clockwork angel gains
    proficiency with all martial weapons as a result.
desc_long: |-
  Clockwork angels are usually built in accord with divine agencies to serve as defenders of holy sites, but are themselves not intrinsically agents of goodness. Indeed, certain evil sects enjoy the irony of constructing beatific “fauxangels” to guard their profane temples. In such cases, a clockwork angel's appearance is often augmented with grisly additions meant to blaspheme against enemy faiths, yet such changes are largely cosmetic and have no effect on the creature's statistics. 

  Clockwork angels are constructed around a spark of life harnessed from the Positive Energy Plane, which imbues them with a sort of artificial life and further bolsters their potency. A clockwork angel stands 7 feet tall and weighs 450 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**Enhance Weapon (Su)** When initially created, a clockwork angel is granted the ability to infuse a single wielded masterwork melee weapon with magical power. The creator determines what sort of effects each clockwork angel can grant to its weapon, as long as the enhancements are equivalent to a +3 enhancement bonus. Most clockwork angels are granted the ability to transform a wielded weapon into a +1 _flaming_ _keen_ weapon. A clockwork angel can infuse a melee weapon it wields in this manner at will as a free action; it can have only one such weapon at a time, and the weapon loses its magical infusion and reverts to a masterwork weapon as soon as the clockwork angel drops it or is destroyed.

**Infused Heart (Su)** A clockwork angel’s mechanical heart is infused with a tiny mote of power siphoned from the Positive Energy Plane. This heart provides the clockwork angel a tiny _[[spells/Spark|spark]]_ of life, allowing it to apply its Charisma modifier as a bonus to its hit points per Hit Die (+80 hp total for the typical clockwork angel). A clockwork angel is healed by positive energy and harmed by negative energy as if it were a living creature.

**Programmed Sentinel (Ex)** Although unintelligent, a clockwork angel is programmed upon creation with a wide range of weaponry skills. The clockwork angel gains proficiency with all martial weapons as a result.

##### Description

Clockwork angels are usually built in accord with divine agencies to serve as defenders of holy sites, but are themselves not intrinsically agents of goodness. Indeed, certain evil sects enjoy the irony of constructing beatific “fauxangels” to _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_ their profane temples. In such cases, a clockwork angel’s appearance is often augmented with grisly additions meant to blaspheme against enemy faiths, yet such changes are largely cosmetic and have no effect on the creature’s statistics.

Clockwork angels are constructed around a _spark_ of life harnessed from the Positive Energy Plane, which imbues them with a sort of artificial life and further bolsters their potency. A clockwork angel stands 7 feet tall and weighs 450 pounds.
