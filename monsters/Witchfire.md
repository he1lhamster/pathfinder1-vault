  Witchflame (Su): Any creature damaged by the incorporeal touch or ranged bolt attacks
    of a witchfire must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or become engulfed in sickly
    green flames. While these eerie flames deal no additional damage, the affected
    creature glows as per faerie fire and becomes sickened. While under the effects
    of the witchflame, the victim gains vulnerability to fire and takes half again
    as much damage (+50%) from fire attacks of any sort. This effect persists for
    10 minutes. The supernatural flames can only be extinguished before this duration
    expires by a break enchantment, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell-the effective
    caster level of the witchflame is equal to the witchfire's HD (CL 10th for most
    witchfires). Any creature entering the same square as a witchfire or striking
    it with a melee attack must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or begin burning with
    witchflame, even if the attack would not otherwise harm the witchfire because
    of its incorporeal nature. A bolt of witchflame has a range of 60 feet with no
    range increment. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  When an exceptionally vile hag or witch dies with some malicious plot left incomplete, or proves too horridly tenacious to succumb to the call of death, the foul energies of these wicked old crones sometimes spawn incorporeal undead known as witchfires. These ghostly creatures appear much as they did in life, although the grotesque undead energy that births them makes them appear young and attractive and wreathes their insubstantial bodies in a powerful aura of sickly green flame, a ghostly fire referred to as “witchflame” in local legends.

  Strings of will-o'-wisps are often found in the immediate vicinity of witchfires and are typically led by the undead, leading scholars to speculate that the creatures feed off of a witchfire's flames 

  and fury.

##### Description

When an exceptionally vile hag or _[[classes/Witch|witch]]_ dies with some malicious plot left incomplete, or proves too horridly tenacious to succumb to the call of death, the foul energies of these wicked old crones sometimes spawn _incorporeal_ undead known as witchfires. These ghostly creatures appear much as they did in life, although the grotesque undead energy that births them makes them appear young and attractive and wreathes their insubstantial bodies in a powerful aura of sickly green flame, a ghostly fire referred to as “witchflame” in local legends.

Strings of will-o’-wisps are often found in the immediate vicinity of witchfires and are typically led by the undead, leading scholars to speculate that the creatures feed off of a _witchfire_’s flames

and fury.
