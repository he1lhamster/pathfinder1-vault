cssclass: [monsters]
title1: Tuyewera
desc_short: The figure that crawls up from the grave may have once been a living man,
  but it is now wholly a monster. Its flesh crawls with worms and seeps with decay,
  allowing bones and internal organs to slip through hideous tears here and there.
  Its jaw distends and a long tongue whips out, almost like a tentacle. Its legs have
  been severed at the knee, forcing it to scrabble forward on all fours like some
  deranged beast.

special_abilities:
  Daytime Invisibility (Su): During the day, a tuyewera is invisible as long as it
    doesn't attack. This effect functions as the invisibility spell, but lasts for
    the entire day. If a tuyewera takes any action that would negate its invisibility
    (such as attacking), it remains visible until it takes a full-round action to
    reactivate its invisibility.
  Lure (Su): If a tuyewera possesses a stolen tongue (see steal tongue ability), it
    can lure creatures into a trancelike state and compel them to approach as a standard
    action. When a tuyewera uses its lure, it must target an intelligent creature
    within 120 feet to which it has line of effect (but not necessarily line of sight).
    The tuyewera must concentrate to maintain the lure's effects. It then calls out
    to the creature, beckoning it to approach. The target can resist this lure by
    making a successful DC 15 Will save, after which that target is immune to that
    tuyewera's lure ability until the tuyewera gains a different tongue. If the tuyewera
    uses the target's name during the lure, the target suffers a -2 penalty on the
    Will save. If the target fails, she becomes fascinated and attempts to approach
    the tuyewera by the shortest, safest route possible. Once the target is adjacent
    to the tuyewera, she remains motionless and offers no resistance to the undead's
    attacks (although once the tuyewera attacks, it ceases concentration and the victim
    is free to act, assuming she survives the monster's attack). This is a sonic mindaffecting
    charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Suffocation (Su): A tuyewera does not breathe itself, but it can attempt to steal
    the breath of a helpless, fascinated, or stunned adjacent creature as a standard
    action. When the tuyewera attempts this, it moves its mouth next to the victim's
    mouth and inhales, drawing the victim's breath out of her body. The victim can
    attempt to resist this attack by making a DC 15 Fortitude save. If she fails,
    the victim is stunned for 1 round and begins to suffocate. The victim falls unconscious
    on the second round, drops to -1 hit points on the third, and dies of suffocation
    on the fourth. Each round, the victim may attempt a new DC 15 Fortitude save to
    end the suffocation effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Steal Tongue (Su): A tuyewera does not possess a tongue of its own when it is created-it
    must steal a tongue from a recently slain (no more than 1 day ago) creature before
    it can speak, attack with its tongue, or use its lure or constriction attacks.
    Stealing a tongue is a full-round action, after which the stolen tongue merges
    with the tuyewera's jaw. The tuyewera gains the ability to speak and understand
    all of the languages known by the dead body from which the tongue was harvested,
    and its voice sounds exactly like that of the dead creature while it still lived.
    The monster's new tongue is a dangerous weapon as well, and can extend to a length
    of nearly 5 feet to attack and constrict foes. A stolen tongue only lasts until
    the next sunrise, after which it rots away to corruption in a single round, forcing
    the tuyewera to seek out a replacement before it regains its speech and attacks.
desc_long: The tuyewera is a hideous creation designed to serve not only as a stealthy
  minion but also as a monstrous assassin. Invisible during the day, a tuyewera can
  be sent into an enemy's lair to perform any number of missions desired by its creator
  or master. A tuyewera that lacks a master is a free-willed undead-in wilderness
  regions, it wanders aimlessly, constantly searching for signs of civilization. If
  it finds such signs, it invariably seeks out a graveyard and lurks in hiding, waiting
  for a new body to be buried so that it can burrow into the grave and steal the corpse's
  tongue at the first opportunity. The tuyewera then stalks the region, looking for
  mourners of the dead person to lure into a secluded area and suffocate, before stealing
  their tongues to repeat the process.

### Special Abilities

**Daytime _Invisibility_ (Su)** During the day, a _[[monsters/Tuyewera|tuyewera]]_ is _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ as long as it doesn’t attack. This effect functions as the _invisibility_ spell, but lasts for the entire day. If a _tuyewera_ takes any action that would negate its _invisibility_ (such as attacking), it remains visible until it takes a full-round action to reactivate its _invisibility_.

**Lure (Su)** If a _tuyewera_ possesses a stolen tongue (see steal tongue ability), it can lure creatures into a trancelike state and compel them to approach as a standard action. When a _tuyewera_ uses its lure, it must target an intelligent creature within 120 feet to which it has line of effect (but not necessarily line of sight). The _tuyewera_ must concentrate to maintain the lure’s effects. It then calls out to the creature, beckoning it to approach. The target can resist this lure by making a successful DC 15 Will save, after which that target is immune to that _tuyewera_’s lure ability until the _tuyewera_ gains a different tongue. If the _tuyewera_ uses the target’s name during the lure, the target suffers a –2 penalty on the Will save. If the target fails, she becomes _[[conditions/Fascinated|fascinated]]_ and attempts to approach the _tuyewera_ by the shortest, safest route possible. Once the target is adjacent to the _tuyewera_, she remains motionless and offers no _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ to the undead’s attacks (although once the _tuyewera_ attacks, it ceases concentration and the victim is free to act, assuming she survives the monster’s attack). This is a sonic mindaffecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
**_Suffocation_ (Su)** A _tuyewera_ does not breathe itself, but it can attempt to steal the breath of a _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_, _fascinated_, or _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_ adjacent creature as a standard action. When the _tuyewera_ attempts this, it moves its mouth next to the victim’s mouth and inhales, drawing the victim’s breath out of her body. The victim can attempt to resist this attack by making a DC 15 Fortitude save. If she fails, the victim is _stunned_ for 1 round and begins to suffocate. The victim falls _[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_ on the second round, drops to –1 hit points on the third, and dies of _suffocation_ on the fourth. Each round, the victim may attempt a new DC 15 Fortitude save to end the _suffocation_ effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
**Steal Tongue (Su)** A _tuyewera_ does not possess a tongue of its own when it is created—it must steal a tongue from a recently slain (no more than 1 day ago) creature before it can speak, attack with its tongue, or use its lure or constriction attacks. Stealing a tongue is a full-round action, after which the stolen tongue merges with the _tuyewera_’s jaw.

A stolen tongue only lasts until the next sunrise, after which it rots away to corruption in a single round, forcing the _tuyewera_ to seek out a replacement before it regains its speech and attacks.

##### Description

The _tuyewera_ is a hideous creation designed to serve not only as a _[[feats/Stealthy|stealthy]]_ minion but also as a monstrous assassin. _Invisible_ during the day, a _tuyewera_ can be sent into an enemy’s lair to perform any number of missions desired by its creator or master. A _tuyewera_ that lacks a master is a free-willed undead—in wilderness regions, it wanders aimlessly, constantly searching for signs of civilization. If it finds such signs, it invariably seeks out a graveyard and lurks in hiding, waiting for a new body to be buried so that it can _[[universal monster rules/Burrow|burrow]]_ into the grave and steal the corpse’s tongue at the first opportunity. The _tuyewera_ then stalks the region, looking for mourners of the dead person to lure into a secluded area and suffocate, before stealing their _[[spells/Tongues|tongues]]_ to repeat the process.
