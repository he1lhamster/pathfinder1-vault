  Capitulating Gaze (Su): Creatures within 30 feet that meet the occulari's gaze are
    lulled into a complacent stupor and cannot move, as if affected by hold monster
    (Will DC 18 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Eye Possession (Su): An occulari that begins its turn in a space occupied by a creature
    paralyzed by its capitulating gaze attack may spend a full-round action to burrow
    tendrils into the victim's eyes, plucking them out and blinding the creature;
    a successful DC 18 Fortitude saving throw resists this attempt. As a standard
    action, an occulari can insert two of its own eyes into a blinded victim that
    shares its space (Fortitude DC 18 negates). On a failed save, the victim is cured
    of its blindness and gains darkvision 60 feet, but the occulari can see through
    its victim's new eyes at will. An occulari may also cloud the sight of any eye
    possession victims at will, granting it total concealment against any creature
    whose eyes it has replaced. A remove disease spell removes the parasitic eyes,
    rendering the creature blind, while a regenerate spell removes the occulari implants
    and restores a creature's vision. If the occulari is killed, any victims of its
    eye possession are blinded. The saving throw DCs are Constitution-based.
  Multigaze (Su): As a standard action, an occulari can actively gaze at up to 3 creatures
    within 30 feet.
  Unavoidable Gaze (Su): Sighted creatures in an occulari's space cannot avert their
    eyes to avoid the occulari's gaze attack, and take a -4 penalty on saving throws
    against the gaze attack.
desc_long: Occularis are amalgams of grotesquely mutated eyes. Motivated by their
  desire to see all things, they hunt down hosts for their component parts and use
  them to experience the wider world. Many covet the sights that the aboveground world
  offers, while others work as spies for intellect devourers, who provide these hideous
  swarms with a sense of purpose and ample prey.

**Eye _Possession_ (Su)** An _occulari_ that begins its turn in a space occupied by a creature _[[conditions/Paralyzed|paralyzed]]_ by its capitulating _gaze_ attack may spend a full-round action to _[[universal monster rules/Burrow|burrow]]_ tendrils into the victim’s eyes, plucking them out and _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Blinding|blinding]]_ the creature; a successful DC 18 Fortitude saving throw resists this attempt.

On a failed save, the victim is cured of its blindness and gains _darkvision_ 60 feet, but the _occulari_ can see through its victim’s new eyes at will. An _occulari_ may also cloud the sight of any eye _possession_ victims at will, granting it total concealment against any creature whose eyes it has replaced. A _[[spells/Remove Disease|remove disease]]_ spell removes the parasitic eyes, rendering the creature blind, while a _[[spells/Regenerate|regenerate]]_ spell removes the _occulari_ implants and restores a creature’s _[[spells/Vision|vision]]_.

##### Description

Occularis are amalgams of grotesquely mutated eyes. Motivated by their desire to see all things, they hunt down hosts for their component parts and use them to experience the wider world. Many covet the sights that the aboveground world offers, while others work as spies for intellect devourers, who provide these hideous swarms with a sense of purpose and ample prey.
