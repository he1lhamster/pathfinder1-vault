  Captive Time (Ex): Once per hour, a clockwork gunslinger can rotate its built-in
    hourglass as a swift action to instantly reload its pistol and gain the effects
    of haste for 1 round. Additionally, the first time a clockwork gunslinger confirms
    a critical hit against an opponent, its hourglass shatters and each creature within
    a 30-foot radius of the clockwork gunslinger must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude
    save or be slowed as per the slow spell for 3 rounds. Once the hourglass is shattered,
    the clockwork gunslinger is unable to use this ability until a new hourglass is
    installed. This save DC is Constitution-based.
  Integrated Clockwork Pistol (Ex): One of a clockwork gunslinger's arms ends in an
    integrated clockwork pistol. This weapon cannot be disarmed, sundered, or removed.
    It is fed bullets automatically from an internal cache inside the clockwork's
    body. Its programming grants Deadly Aim, Point-Blank Shot, and Precise Shot as
    bonus feats.
desc_long: |-
  While clockwork gunslingers are found mostly in Alkenstar, prominent figureheads of foreign cities sometimes purchase custom-built models for their own protection. Clockwork gunslingers are efficient sharpshooters, eliminating foes before they can draw close enough to prove a threat. Their primary design is to serve as guards, either for a specific location, for a particular person, or patrolling bustling streets of a city, but their creators often use them for assistance on missions that involve extracting high-value targets from dangerous locations. The constructs' standard operating procedure is to evaluate a situation and engage in combat only if their own safety or that of whatever they are guarding is threatened.

   Inside a clockwork gunslinger's hardened chassis, a large cache of bullets and powder is automatically fed into its pistol. Custom clockwork gunslingers sometimes have specialty ammunition in place of bullets as well as other decorations, though this change carries with it a corresponding upcharge.

   A clockwork gunslinger stands 6 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.

##### Description

While clockwork gunslingers are found mostly in Alkenstar, prominent figureheads of foreign cities sometimes purchase custom-built models for their own protection. Clockwork gunslingers are efficient sharpshooters, eliminating foes before they can draw close enough to prove a threat. Their primary design is to serve as guards, either for a specific location, for a particular person, or patrolling bustling streets of a city, but their creators often use them for assistance on missions that involve extracting high-value targets from dangerous locations. The constructs’ standard operating procedure is to evaluate a situation and engage in combat only if their own safety or that of whatever they are _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Guarding|guarding]]_ is threatened.

Inside a clockwork _gunslinger_’s hardened chassis, a large cache of bullets and _[[items/Mundane/Powder|powder]]_ is automatically fed into its _pistol_. Custom clockwork gunslingers sometimes have specialty ammunition in place of bullets as well as other decorations, though this change carries with it a corresponding upcharge.

A clockwork _gunslinger_ stands 6 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.
