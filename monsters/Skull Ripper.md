  Behead (Ex): A skull ripper is an expert at collecting its favorite trophies-skulls.
    Once it has pinned a foe, it can attempt to behead the victim with a single gut-wrenching
    rip of its claws. This attempt is made as part of the grapple check to maintain
    an existing pin, and if successful, deals 4d6+18 points of damage to the victim.
    If this damage is enough to bring the target below 0 hit points, the victim must
    succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save to resist having its head torn from its body,
    which results in instant death for most creatures. The save DC is Strength-based.
  Dread Visage (Su): All creatures within 30 feet that can see a skull ripper must
    make a DC 18 Will save at the start of their turn in order to avoid becoming frightened
    for 1 round. If the victim recognizes any of the heads affixed to the skull ripper's
    body as having once belonged to friends or allies, that victim takes a -4 penalty
    on the save. A creature that succeeds at the save is immune to the dread visage
    of that particular skull ripper for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
    The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Poison (Su): Sting-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect
    1d4 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

  emerges and ventures forth into the world above, harvesting skulls and causing widespread
  panic as it searches for a new tomb to guard.

##### Description

Skull rippers were once guardians of the dead, the grim
custodians of the great ossuaries of Thassilon. Although
most skull rippers are discovered in ancient tombs
and sepulchers, occasionally a geological upheaval or
massive flood destroys a given catacomb or leaves a skull
ripper stranded. In these cases, the construct emerges
and ventures forth into the world above, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Harvesting|harvesting]]_
skulls and causing widespread panic as it searches for a
new tomb to _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_.
