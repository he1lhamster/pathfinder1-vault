  A combination of hare and grouse, skvaders boast features and mannerisms of both animals. At first glance, a skvader appears to be a common hare, though its shorter ears distinguish it from the longer-eared rabbits. Its wings, hindquarters, and tail usually have a coloration similar to its fur, and its birdlike features are only easily distinguishable up close. Skvaders are twitchy and nervous, constantly on the lookout for predators. They switch between standing stock still upon sensing danger and quickly bolting to escape. While generally docile, skvaders become dangerous if cornered.

  A skvader is about 1-1/2 feet long and weighs around 10 pounds.

##### Description

A combination of hare and grouse, skvaders boast features and mannerisms of both animals. At first glance, a _skvader_ appears to be a common hare, though its shorter ears distinguish it from the longer-eared rabbits. Its wings, hindquarters, and tail usually have a coloration similar to its fur, and its birdlike features are only easily distinguishable up close. Skvaders are twitchy and nervous, constantly on the _[[feats/Lookout|lookout]]_ for predators. They switch between standing stock still upon _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Sensing|sensing]]_ danger and quickly bolting to escape. While generally docile, skvaders become dangerous if cornered.

A _skvader_ is about 1-1/2 feet long and weighs around 10 pounds.
