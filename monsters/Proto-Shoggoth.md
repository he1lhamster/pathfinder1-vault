special_abilities:
  Create Spawn (Ex): A creature that dies while suffering from a proto-shoggoth's
    infect flesh ability, either from the effects of the infection itself or from
    any other source, becomes a potential host for a new proto-shoggoth. Only 2d6
    hours after death, as long as the majority of the creature's body remains relatively
    intact, a new protoshoggoth tears itself out of the corpse. This destroys the
    old body, preventing spells like speak with dead or raise dead from functioning
    on the remains. A creature slain by an effect such as disintegrate that leaves
    no body behind can't spawn a proto-shoggoth. Likewise, if an infected body is
    completely destroyed by fire, acid, or any similar effect, it can't spawn a proto-shoggoth.
    A body infected with proto-shoggoth material is not contagious-it can't infect
    other creatures through contact.
  Infect Flesh (Ex): When a living creature takes damage from a proto-shoggoth's constrict
    ability, the monster infects the creature's flesh with its alien enzymes. The
    victim can resist this infection with a successful DC 23 Fortitude save. Otherwise,
    the creature becomes sickened as microscopic fragments of proto-shoggoth tissue
    infest the victim, slowly transforming it from the inside into proto-shoggoth
    material. In addition to being sickened as long as the creature remains infected,
    it must succeed at an additional DC 23 Fortitude save once every 24 hours or it
    takes 1d4 points of Constitution drain as its body begins to consume itself. This
    is an infestation effect. An infestation is similar to a disease, but it can be
    cured only through specific means; no matter how many saving throws a target succeeds
    at, the infestation continues to affect the target. While remove disease or similar
    spells can halt the progress of this infected flesh as if it were a disease, immunity
    to disease offers no protection. Application of negative energy can halt this
    infestation as well; each time an infected creature is reduced to negative hit
    points by such an effect, the victim can attempt a new DC 23 Fortitude save. On
    a success, the infection immediately ends as the negative energy scours the proto-shoggoth
    material out of the victim's body. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Merge (Ex): As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, two proto-shoggoths
    can merge together in an attempt to fuse. In order to do so, each proto-shoggoth
    must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save-if either fails, both proto-shoggoths become
    staggered for 1d6 rounds. Those two proto-shoggoths are then incompatible, and
    can never again attempt to merge with each other, although the individual proto-shoggoths
    can attempt to do so with other proto-shoggoths in the future. If both proto-shoggoths
    succeed at the Fortitude save, they immediately merge together and form a Large
    proto-shoggoth syncytium (see the stat block below).
desc_long: |-
  Early attempts by the elder things (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 85) to craft life resulted in strange, heaving masses of protoplasm that displayed a disturbing hunger for living flesh. Emboldened by this discovery, the alien scientists soon stabilized this matter, resulting in the creation of the first proto-shoggoths.

  A proto-shoggoth appears as a tangled mass of roiling flesh and organs weighing approximately 160 pounds, and is capable of forming all manner of hideous and nauseating shapes.

### Special Abilities

**Create Spawn (Ex)** A creature that dies while suffering from a _[[monsters/Proto-Shoggoth|proto-shoggoth]]_’s infect flesh ability, either from the effects of the infection itself or from any other source, becomes a potential host for a new _proto-shoggoth_. Only 2d6 hours after death, as long as the majority of the creature’s body remains relatively intact, a new protoshoggoth tears itself out of the corpse. This destroys the old body, preventing spells like _[[spells/Speak with Dead|speak with dead]]_ or _[[spells/Raise Dead|raise dead]]_ from functioning on the remains. A creature slain by an effect such as _[[spells/Disintegrate|disintegrate]]_ that leaves no body behind can’t spawn a _proto-shoggoth_. Likewise, if an infected body is completely destroyed by fire, acid, or any similar effect, it can’t spawn a _proto-shoggoth_. A body infected with _proto-shoggoth_ material is not contagious—it can’t infect other creatures through contact.

**Infect Flesh (Ex)** When a living creature takes damage from a _proto-shoggoth_’s _constrict_ ability, the monster infects the creature’s flesh with its alien enzymes. The victim can resist this infection with a successful DC 23 Fortitude save. Otherwise, the creature becomes _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ as microscopic fragments of _proto-shoggoth_ tissue infest the victim, slowly transforming it from the inside into _proto-shoggoth_ material. In addition to being _sickened_ as long as the creature remains infected, it must succeed at an additional DC 23 Fortitude save once every 24 hours or it takes 1d4 points of Constitution drain as its body begins to consume itself. This is an infestation effect. An infestation is similar to a disease, but it can be cured only through specific means; no matter how many saving throws a target succeeds at, the infestation continues to affect the target. While _[[spells/Remove Disease|remove disease]]_ or similar spells can halt the progress of this infected flesh as if it were a disease, _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to disease offers no protection. Application of negative energy can halt this infestation as well; each time an infected creature is reduced to negative hit points by such an effect, the victim can attempt a new DC 23 Fortitude save. On a success, the infection immediately ends as the negative energy scours the _proto-shoggoth_ material out of the victim’s body. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Merge (Ex)** As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, two proto-shoggoths can merge together in an attempt to fuse. In order to do so, each _proto-shoggoth_ must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save—if either fails, both proto-shoggoths become _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1d6 rounds. Those two proto-shoggoths are then incompatible, and can never again attempt to merge with each other, although the individual proto-shoggoths can attempt to do so with other proto-shoggoths in the future. If both proto-shoggoths succeed at the Fortitude save, they immediately merge together and form a Large _proto-shoggoth_ syncytium (see the stat block below).

##### Description

Early attempts by the elder things (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 85) to craft life resulted in strange, heaving masses of protoplasm that displayed a disturbing hunger for living flesh. Emboldened by this discovery, the alien scientists soon stabilized this matter, resulting in the creation of the first proto-shoggoths.

A _proto-shoggoth_ appears as a tangled mass of roiling flesh and organs weighing approximately 160 pounds, and is capable of forming all manner of hideous and nauseating shapes.
