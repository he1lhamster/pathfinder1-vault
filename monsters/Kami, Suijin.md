special_abilities:
  Breath Weapon (Su): When a suijin uses its breath weapon, it unleashes a pressurized
    blast of water that knocks over and soaks everything in its line of effect. Any
    creature that is struck by the blast and fails its saving throw is pushed back
    10 feet as though bull rushed. For every 5 by which a creature fails its saving
    throw, it is pushed back an additional 5 feet. This effect also extinguishes any
    normal fires within the line of effect, as well as magical fires, which are dispelled
    as though by greater dispel magic. A suijin can choose to have its breath weapon
    deal nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage before using this ability.
  Whitewater Barrier (Su): Three times per day as a standard action, a suijin can
    create a wall of turbulent water. A suijin can make this barrier however long
    it wishes, up to a maximum length of 180 feet, and the wall is 20 feet tall. A
    whitewater barrier acts as a sheet of stormy water, and any Large or smaller creature
    that attempts to pass through the barrier must succeed at a DC 26 Swim check or
    be rushed to the top of the wave and pushed back to the side it started on, taking
    fall damage as appropriate. It is possible to create cylindrical or square whitewater
    barriers to enclose specific points. This effect acts like wind wall in regard
    to how ranged missiles, breath weapons, gases, and creatures in gaseous form interact
    with it. The Swim DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
  Suijins are the kami of lakes, ponds, springs, and wells. When they are not merged with their wards, these spirits of nature resemble giant carp or sea serpents, usually beautiful specimens with rainbow scales. While they are as benevolent and well meaning as all other kami, suijins are often mistaken for beasts of the waters they inhabit, and are thus feared by superstitious or simple-minded creatures. Those who encounter suijins know better than to believe such unfounded fears, however, as the kami often only emerge from their wards in order to protect innocent creatures in trouble near its waters. Considered reclusive even by other kami, a suijin usually tries to protect creatures within its wards by covert means if at all possible, slowing the f low of its waters' currents or pushing struggling creatures to shore via magic. Suijins are infinitely patient, and though most enjoy helping creatures, those in more remote regions are just as content to simply exist among their waters, protecting their wards from those who would seek to defile them. The general attitude among most suijins is often one of simple acceptance of things as they are, based on the belief that all things are f luid and subject to change; even the largest lakes are bound to recede or expand, and even the most eternal kami are not entirely permanent, a point proven by the vicious oni.

  In its true form, a typical suijin is 15 feet long and weighs about 1,200 pounds, though numerous rumors suggest that lesser and greater suijins do exist in some parts of the world, typically residing in bodies of water that are proportionate to the kami's size and power.

##### Description

Suijins are the kami of lakes, ponds, springs, and wells. When they are not merged with their wards, these spirits of nature resemble giant carp or sea serpents, usually beautiful specimens with rainbow scales. While they are as _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Benevolent|benevolent]]_ and well meaning as all other kami, suijins are often mistaken for beasts of the waters they inhabit, and are thus feared by superstitious or simple-minded creatures. Those who encounter suijins know better than to believe such unfounded fears, however, as the kami often only emerge from their wards in order to protect innocent creatures in trouble near its waters. Considered reclusive even by other kami, a suijin usually tries to protect creatures within its wards by covert means if at all possible, slowing the f low of its waters’ currents or pushing struggling creatures to shore via magic. Suijins are infinitely patient, and though most enjoy helping creatures, those in more remote regions are just as content to simply exist among their waters, protecting their wards from those who would seek to defile them. The general attitude among most suijins is often one of simple acceptance of things as they are, based on the belief that all things are f luid and subject to change; even the largest lakes are bound to recede or expand, and even the most eternal kami are not entirely permanent, a point proven by the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_ oni.

In its _[[spells/True Form|true form]]_, a typical suijin is 15 feet long and weighs about 1,200 pounds, though numerous rumors suggest that lesser and greater suijins do exist in some parts of the world, typically residing in bodies of water that are proportionate to the kami’s size and power.
