special_abilities:
  Cataclysmic Roar (Ex): Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, an abysogh can
    emit a terrible roar in a 60-foot cone. Creatures caught in this cone take 10d6
    points of sonic damage and are deafened and staggered for 1d6 rounds. A successful
    DC 25 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates both conditions. This is a
    sonic effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Freedom of Movement (Ex): An abysogh is under the constant effect of freedom of
    movement, as the spell. This effect cannot be dispelled.
  Living Ammunition (Ex): |-
    When an abysogh succeeds at a combat maneuver check to initiate or maintain a grapple against a creature two or more size categories smaller than itself, it can hurl the creature anywhere within 60 feet as a free action, though if it does so after maintaining a grapple, it can't perform any of the actions that can normally be taken as part of maintaining a grapple. Regardless of the trajectory, the hurled creature takes 6d6 points of damage from the collision and falls prone. The creature can attempt a DC 25 Reflex save to halve the damage and avoid falling prone. The save DC is Constitution-based.

     If the targeted square contains another creature, the abysogh makes a ranged attack against the target. A hurled Large creature deals 4d6 points of damage, a Medium creature deals 3d6 points of damage, and a Small creature deals 2d6 points of damage. The abysogh adds 1-1/2 its Strength bonus to this damage. Tiny or smaller creatures don't deal damage to the target. Whether the attack hits or not, the hurled creature lands in an empty space of the abysogh's choice adjacent to the target.
  Trembling Earth (Ex): When an abysogh moves more than 5 feet in a round, its footsteps
    send seismic waves rippling across the ground. All creatures at least two size
    categories smaller than the abysogh that are standing on the ground within 20
    feet of the giant at any point during its movement must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex
    save or fall prone. The save DC is Constitution-based. The vibrations also suppress
    tremorsense within the area for 1 round (no save).
  Whirlwind Strike (Ex): An abysogh can send multiple opponents flying through the
    air with its sweeping slams. When an abysogh uses the full-attack action, instead
    of making its normal attacks, it can perform one awesome blow combat maneuver
    at its highest base attack bonus against each opponent within its reach. It must
    attempt a separate combat maneuver check against each opponent. When using this
    ability, the abysogh forfeits any bonuses and extra attacks granted by feats,
    spells, or abilities.
desc_long: |-
  Rather than collecting rocks like ordinary giants, abysoghs enjoy collecting living creatures, and love nothing more than flinging a screaming human or horse at enemies.

  Legends tell of a small cult of foolish storm giants who dug around the Pit of Gormuz in a misguided attempt to free lost Ranginori, and struck a flow of horrific blood from Rovagug or one of his spawn. Contaminated by the blood, the cultists emerged as horribly mutated creatures of hate and destruction. Nearly unstoppable in their mindless rage, they now live only to slaughter and destroy.

  An abysogh stands at least 40 feet tall and weighs approximately 70 tons.

### Special Abilities

**Cataclysmic Roar (Ex)** Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, an _[[monsters/Abysogh|abysogh]]_ can emit a terrible roar in a 60-foot cone. Creatures caught in this cone take 10d6 points of sonic damage and are _[[conditions/Deafened|deafened]]_ and _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ for 1d6 rounds. A successful DC 25 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates both conditions. This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**_Freedom of Movement_ (Ex)** An _abysogh_ is under the constant effect of _freedom of movement_, as the spell. This effect cannot be dispelled.

**Living Ammunition (Ex)** When an _abysogh_ succeeds at a combat maneuver check to _[[npcs/Initiate|initiate]]_ or maintain a grapple against a creature two or more size categories smaller than itself, it can hurl the creature anywhere within 60 feet as a free action, though if it does so after maintaining a grapple, it can’t perform any of the actions that can normally be taken as part of maintaining a grapple. Regardless of the trajectory, the hurled creature takes 6d6 points of damage from the collision and falls _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_. The creature can attempt a DC 25 Reflex save to halve the damage and avoid falling _prone_. The save DC is Constitution-based.

If the targeted square contains another creature, the _abysogh_ makes a ranged attack against the target. A hurled Large creature deals 4d6 points of damage, a Medium creature deals 3d6 points of damage, and a Small creature deals 2d6 points of damage. The _abysogh_ adds 1-1/2 its Strength bonus to this damage. Tiny or smaller creatures don’t deal damage to the target. Whether the attack hits or not, the hurled creature lands in an empty space of the _abysogh_’s choice adjacent to the target.

**Trembling Earth (Ex)** When an _abysogh_ moves more than 5 feet in a round, its footsteps send seismic waves rippling across the ground. All creatures at least two size categories smaller than the _abysogh_ that are standing on the ground within 20 feet of the giant at any point during its movement must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save or fall _prone_. The save DC is Constitution-based. The vibrations also suppress _[[universal monster rules/Tremorsense|tremorsense]]_ within the area for 1 round (no save).

**_Whirlwind_ Strike (Ex)** An _abysogh_ can send multiple opponents flying through the air with its sweeping slams. When an _abysogh_ uses the full-attack action, instead of making its normal attacks, it can perform one _awesome blow_ combat maneuver at its highest base attack bonus against each opponent within its reach. It must attempt a separate combat maneuver check against each opponent. When using this ability, the _abysogh_ forfeits any bonuses and extra attacks granted by feats, spells, or abilities.

##### Description

Rather than collecting rocks like ordinary giants, abysoghs enjoy collecting living creatures, and love nothing more than flinging a screaming human or _[[monsters/Horse|horse]]_ at enemies.

Legends tell of a small cult of foolish storm giants who dug around the Pit of Gormuz in a misguided attempt to free lost Ranginori, and struck a flow of horrific blood from Rovagug or one of his spawn. Contaminated by the blood, the cultists emerged as horribly mutated creatures of hate and _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_. Nearly unstoppable in their mindless _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_, they now live only to slaughter and destroy.

An _abysogh_ stands at least 40 feet tall and weighs approximately 70 tons.
