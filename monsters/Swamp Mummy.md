Fort DC 15; onset 1 minute; frequency

1/day; effect 1d6 Con and 1d6 Dex;

cure —. Bog rot is both a curse and

disease, and can be cured only if

##### Description

Strangled into unlife in the filth and muck of the deep

mire, swamp mummies haunt the festering depths of

isolated, desolate fenlands.

Some swamp mummies are cursed by dark powers to

return to unlife, while others are the victims of sacrifices

or criminal executions in which the bodies were thrown

into a peat bog. The nature of the death and the emotional

power of the victim are both contributing factors as to

whether or not the victim crawls from its swampy grave as

a _swamp mummy_.

Swamp mummies—also often _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ bog or peat

mummies—rarely, if ever, leave their marshy

realms. Those that do most often venture forth

from the swamp to take revenge on their slayers.

While most swamp mummies are motivated by

_[[feats/Vengeance|vengeance]]_, many fulfill these dark yearnings

in a more general sense. Filled with wrath and

hatred for the living, they mercilessly attack any

living creatures that dare to venture into their

dismal domains. Their agonized moans _[[spells/Echo|echo]]_

over their _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Putrid|putrid]]_ homes, driving away the natural

animals dwelling therein and often alerting

travelers to the relentless danger.

Swamp mummies delight in infecting

living foes with bog rot, believing that

adding their victims’ essence to their

gloomy domains expands their power.

After battle, they carry away the bodies of

their _[[monsters/Fallen|fallen]]_ victims to sink them in deep,

isolated pools. Thus, even enemies that

escape the bog rot become one

with the _swamp mummy_’s home.

Most swamp mummies

are _Medium_ humanoids,

typically arising from

the submerged corpses

of human, _[[monsters/Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]]_, or

elven victims—though

instances of swamp

mummies arising from the

corpses of other races is

not _[[monsters/Unknown|unknown]]_.
