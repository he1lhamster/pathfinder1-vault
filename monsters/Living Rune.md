special_abilities:
  Camouflage (Ex): A living rune is able to shift its coloration and form to blend
    into its surroundings. The creature automatically hits with its touch attack against
    any creature that fails to notice it and enters its square.
  Glyph Touch (Su): A living rune deals 3d8 points of electricity damage with a successful
    touch attack, and it uses its Dexterity modifier (instead of its Strength modifier)
    to resolve all touch attacks.
  Immunity to Magic (Ex): A living rune is immune to spells and spell-like abilities
    that allow spell resistance. In addition, certain other spells and effects function
    differently against the creature as noted below. An erase spell deals 6d6 points
    of damage to a living rune.A living rune caught in the radius of any symbol spell
    is immune to its effects and heals 1d8 points of damage per spell level. Hit points
    beyond its total maximum are gained as temporary hit points that fade in 1 hour.A
    living rune is affected normally by magic missile, maze, and spells that deal
    sonic damage.
  Symbols of Power (Su): |-
    As a standard action, a living rune can shift its form into a number of powerful symbols whose effects can damage or incapacitate opponents. Each round the living rune can choose a new effect, but a particular symbol form can only be used once every 4 rounds. This attack is resolved with a touch attack and the save DC is Charisma-based.

    Fear: The target becomes panicked for 2d6 rounds (Will DC 24).

    Pain: The target suffers wracking pains that impose a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 hour (Fort DC 24).

    Persuasion: The target is charmed by the living rune (as charm monster) for 2d6 hours (Will DC 24).

    Slow: The target is slowed (as the slow spell) for 12 rounds (Will DC 24).

    Stunning: The target is stunned for 1d6 rounds (Fort DC 24).

    Weakness: The target suffers crippling weakness that deals 2d6 points of Strength damage (Fort DC 24).
  Truescript (Su): A living rune can sculpt its form into complicated scripts and
    pictographs that can be understood by any creature with the ability to read written
    language. A living rune can also understand any written or spoken language.
  Two-Dimensional (Ex): A living rune only exists in two dimensions, and has some
    qualities in common with incorporeal creatures. A living rune has no Strength
    score. It cannot move in three dimensions (such as jumping or flying), and can
    only navigate along solid surfaces such as floors, ceilings, and walls. It can
    only attack creatures by entering their squares and touching them directly. A
    living rune can crawl onto solid surfaces that can then themselves be moved (such
    as onto a tome via its telekinesis spell-like ability). It cannot fall or take
    falling damage, cannot make trip or grapple attacks, and cannot be tripped or
    grappled. It cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an
    opponent or the opponent's equipment, has no weight, and does not set off traps
    that are triggered by weight. A living rune takes no damage from nonmagical attacks
    and only takes half damage from magical weapons.
desc_long: Whether first scribed by some forgotten deity or birthed by magic glyphs
  long soured, living runes are among the most stubborn and arrogant of dungeon denizens.
  Though two-dimensional and lacking any sort of real body, the creatures are sentient,
  but with a venomous hostility toward the so-called “lesser races” they feel are
  corrupted forms of the universe's first words of creation. Appearing as magical
  glyphs, animated pulsating runes, etched hieroglyphics, or even ancient cave art,
  these creatures live to prey on lesser beings for no other reason than to prove
  their superiority over flesh-and-blood creatures.

##### Description

Whether first scribed by some forgotten deity or birthed by magic glyphs long soured, living runes are among the most stubborn and arrogant of dungeon denizens. Though two-dimensional and lacking any sort of real body, the creatures are sentient, but with a venomous hostility toward the so-called “lesser races” they feel are corrupted forms of the universe’s first words of creation. Appearing as magical glyphs, _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Animated|animated]]_ pulsating runes, etched hieroglyphics, or even ancient cave art, these creatures live to prey on lesser beings for no other reason than to prove their superiority over flesh-and-blood creatures.
