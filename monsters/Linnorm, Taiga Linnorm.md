  Breath Weapon (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a taiga linnorm
    can expel a 60-foot cone of electrified vapor, dealing 21d8 points of electricity
    damage to all creatures struck (Reflex DC 30 for half). The vapor itself persists
    for 1d4 rounds, filling its cone-shaped area with electrified mist that deals
    4d6 points of electricity damage (no save) to any creature that ends its turn
    in the mist. The mist does not hinder vision. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Death Curse (Su): 'Curse of Electrocution: save Will DC 29; effect the creature
    gains vulnerability to electricity.'
  Poison (Ex): Bite-injury; save Fort DC 30; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect
    4d6 electricity damage and 1d8 Dex drain; cure 3 consecutive saves.
  Spines (Ex): Any creature that makes a melee attack against a taiga linnorm takes
    1d6 points of piercing damage per attack from the linnorm's spines. A melee weapon
    with reach provides protection from these spines.
desc_long: |-
  A beast covered with hundreds of spines, the taiga linnorm is a terror to all those who venture through the arctic forests of the north. Taiga linnorms take down foes and prey first with their electrifying breath and finish their victims off with their devastating bite.

  In winter, when light is sparse and the nights are long, it is easy for a taiga linnorm to blend in with the coniferous forests it dwells in, hiding among the trees and ambushing imprudent travelers or unwary adventurers setting up camp. A taiga linnorm often lies in wait for days-sometimes weeks-just for the opportunity to maim and devour unsuspecting victims. When this subtler tactic does not work, a taiga linnorm simply rampages through the woods in order to find nearby settlements to pillage, taking twisted delight in shocking the inhabitants before shredding them with its massive jaws or destructive forelimbs. In any event, taiga linnorms rarely venture far from their woodland territories save for short flights to attack outlying villages.

  A taiga linnorm is 50 feet long and weighs just over 13,000 pounds.

##### Description

A beast covered with hundreds of spines, the taiga linnorm is a terror to all those who venture through the arctic forests of the north. Taiga linnorms take down foes and prey first with their electrifying breath and finish their victims off with their devastating bite.

In winter, when light is sparse and the nights are long, it is easy for a taiga linnorm to _[[spells/Blend|blend]]_ in with the coniferous forests it dwells in, hiding among the trees and ambushing imprudent travelers or unwary adventurers setting up camp. A taiga linnorm often lies in wait for days—sometimes weeks—just for the opportunity to maim and devour unsuspecting victims. When this subtler tactic does not work, a taiga linnorm simply rampages through the woods in order to find nearby settlements to pillage, taking twisted delight in shocking the inhabitants before shredding them with its massive jaws or destructive forelimbs. In any event, taiga linnorms rarely venture far from their woodland territories save for short flights to attack outlying villages.
