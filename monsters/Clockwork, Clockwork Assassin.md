### Special Abilities

**Integrated _Rapier_ (Ex)** One of a clockwork assassin’s arms ends in an integrated +1 _rapier_. This weapon cannot be disarmed, sundered, or removed, and becomes nonmagical if the clockwork is destroyed. A clockwork assassin’s programming allows it to wield its +1 _rapier_ as if it were proficient in its use.

**Projectile Launcher (Ex)** A clockwork can fire up to four projectiles from its hand mechanism. For each projectile, it chooses between a dagger-like metal blade or a _[[items/Mundane/Smoke Bomb|smoke bomb]]_, in any combination it wishes. Each attack resolves separately. Blades resolve as thrown daggers. Smoke bombs function as smokesticks centered on the area targeted. When created, a clockwork assassin’s projectile launcher contains 40 blades and 10 smoke bombs.

**_Rapid Repair_ (Su)** A clockwork assassin repairs damage dealt to itself swiftly, gaining _fast healing_ 10. Once per day, as a full round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a clockwork assassin can bolster its _rapid repair_ to _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ 40 hp and refill its projectile launcher with eight blades and two smoke bombs.
**Standby (Ex)** A clockwork assassin can place itself on standby as a standard action. While on standby, it cannot move or take any actions. It remains aware of its surroundings but takes a –4 penalty on Perception checks. Time spent on standby does not count against its wind-down duration. A clockwork assassin can exit standby as a swift action—if it does so to _[[npcs/Initiate|initiate]]_ combat, it gains a +4 racial bonus on its Initiative check.

##### Description

Clockwork assassins are efficient killers, ready to leap into murderous action as soon as intruders are detected. A clockwork assassin stands 6 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.
