  Note that while the runeslave template does make a giant more powerful (and thus increases its CR), few, if any giants would seek to gain a runeslave's powers.

##### Description

The ageless monuments and awesome cities of
Thassilon rose upon the backs of countless slaves, but
none bore the sin-poisoned civilization’s burden more
than the giants. Able to perform the work of dozens
of human slaves, Thassilon’s _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Titanic|titanic]]_ servants—hill
giants, stone giants, taiga giants, and others—crafted
marvels nigh unparalleled in any era before or since,
and shaped the face of what is now modern Varisia. Yet
as viciously as the runelords worked their slaves and
for all they demanded, the giant-crafted marvels were
not enough. And thus, working the corrupt rune magic
that was theirs alone, the runelords manufactured a
damning curse and laid it over their most tireless and
effective workers, and in so doing created a new breed
of servant: the runeslave.

Numerous severe-looking runes _[[spells/Spark|spark]]_ and flicker
upon a runeslave’s body, seemingly seared into the
creature’s flesh. One of the runes is larger and more
prominent than the others—this is always one of the
runes of Thassilonian magic. Although a runeslave’s
mind is dulled, its muscles bulge grotesquely, as if
barely contained beneath a thin layer of skin, and such
behemoths move with unnatural agility for creatures of
their ponderous size.

Note that while the runeslave template does make a
giant more powerful (and thus increases its CR), few,
if any giants would seek to gain a runeslave’s powers.
Despite the advantages the runeslave gains, what it
loses in free will and longevity typically vastly outweigh
the benefits. In combat, a runeslave is _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ and
terrifying, but in life, the condition is rightly feared
among giants as a devastating and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Debilitating|debilitating]]_ curse.
