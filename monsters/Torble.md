  Ooze-Vermin Hybrid (Ex): Torbles react to ooze-affecting effects as if they were
    oozes and vermin-affecting effects as if they were vermin, whichever is least
    advantageous for the torble or more advantageous for the originator of the effect.
  Primitive Sight (Ex): Though it has blindsight and can operate without vision, a
    torble's simple eyes give it poor sight (mainly light and color) with an effective
    range of 30 feet. Because they can see, they are subject to attacks that affect
    sighted creatures (such as gaze attacks), but as they can still rely on their
    blindsight, they cannot be dazzled or blinded by sight-based attacks.
  Telepathic Sensitivity (Ex): Torbles are receptive to the thoughtenergy of telepathic
    minds. A creature with the telepathy special ability can use a swift action to
    mentally command one torble per point of Charisma bonus for one round, twice that
    many by using a move action, or four times that many by using a standard action.
    The creature's control of the vermin is limited to simple commands (“attack,”
    “defend,” “stop,” and so forth); orders to attack a certain creature when it appears
    or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand.
    Torbles that leave the range of the creature's telepathy immediately revert to
    their standard behavior.
desc_long: |-
  Torbles (called “chordoplasms” by scholars of strange fauna and “ooze bugs” by many others) are strange and fascinating creatures, curious in ways beyond what their simple forms might suggest. These strangely colored creatures resemble a cross between a tiny ooze and an insect. They typically have a bulbous, beetle-like translucent body, six legs, and long eyestalks with primitive sensory knobs on the end. Usually they take on green, gray, or pink shades, though they may be any color. Older torbles often tend toward the colors of large ooze predators such as ochre jellies, black puddings, or the colorless gelatinous cubes, though any relationship between them is unclear. The creature's interior may be clear or cloudy, and has the same consistency and properties of the fluid that surrounds the brains of lower animals. After the creature feeds, however, its color temporarily changes to match the color of its meal-which sometimes remains visible for hours. Although a torble has no true organs, it has a stiff bundle of fibrous nerve tissue running the length of its body that helps hold its shape. When it rests, it retracts its antennae and legs into its body, similar to how a snail or slug withdraws its eyestalks when threatened.

  A typical ooze bug is about 7 inches long and 5 inches wide, and weighs about 1 pound.

**Primitive Sight (Ex)** Though it has _blindsight_ and can operate without _[[spells/Vision|vision]]_, a _torble_’s simple eyes give it poor sight (mainly light and color) with an effective range of 30 feet. Because they can see, they are subject to attacks that affect sighted creatures (such as _[[universal monster rules/Gaze|gaze]]_ attacks), but as they can still rely on their _blindsight_, they cannot be _[[conditions/Dazzled|dazzled]]_ or _[[conditions/Blinded|blinded]]_ by sight-based attacks.

**Telepathic Sensitivity (Ex)** Torbles are receptive to the thoughtenergy of telepathic minds. A creature with the _[[universal monster rules/Telepathy|telepathy]]_ special ability can use a swift action to mentally _[[spells/Command|command]]_ one _torble_ per point of Charisma bonus for one round, twice that many by using a move action, or four times that many by using a standard action. The creature’s control of the vermin is limited to simple commands (“attack,” “defend,” “stop,” and so forth); orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or _[[npcs/Guard|guard]]_ against a particular occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand. Torbles that leave the range of the creature’s _telepathy_ immediately revert to their standard behavior.

##### Description

Torbles (_[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ “chordoplasms” by scholars of strange fauna and “ooze bugs” by many others) are strange and fascinating creatures, curious in ways beyond what their simple forms might suggest. These strangely colored creatures resemble a cross between a tiny ooze and an insect. They typically have a bulbous, beetle-like translucent body, six legs, and long eyestalks with primitive sensory knobs on the end. Usually they take on green, _[[monsters/Gray|gray]]_, or pink _[[spells/Shades|shades]]_, though they may be any color. Older torbles often tend toward the colors of large ooze predators such as ochre jellies, black puddings, or the colorless gelatinous cubes, though any relationship between them is unclear. The creature’s interior may be clear or cloudy, and has the same consistency and properties of the fluid that surrounds the brains of lower animals. After the creature feeds, however, its color temporarily changes to match the color of its meal—which sometimes remains visible for hours. Although a _torble_ has no true organs, it has a stiff bundle of fibrous nerve tissue running the length of its body that helps hold its shape. When it rests, it retracts its antennae and legs into its body, similar to how a snail or slug withdraws its eyestalks when threatened.

A typical ooze bug is about 7 inches long and 5 inches wide, and weighs about 1 pound.
