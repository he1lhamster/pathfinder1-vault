Shadows drip from the hands of this small, humanoid figure.

Massive ears and elaborate eyebrows frame her youthful features.

### Special Abilities

**No _Shadow_ (Ex)** A _[[monsters/Shadow Collector|shadow collector]]_ casts no

_shadow_ of its own, but instead casts any one of

the stolen shadows it possesses.
**Steal _Shadow_ (Su)** A _shadow collector_

automatically steals the _shadow_ of any

_[[universal monster rules/Incorporeal|incorporeal]]_ or living creature destroyed, incapacitated,

or killed by its claw attack. A _shadow collector_ can also steal

a living corporeal creature’s _shadow_ with the steal combat

maneuver; the _shadow_ doesn’t count as fastened to its owner. Until the

_shadow_ is returned, the victim has no _shadow_ or reflection

and gains 2 permanent negative levels. These negative levels

can’t be removed otherwise, even with magic that usually

removes negative levels. When a _shadow collector_ steals a

_shadow_, it gains 2 _shadow_ points. A _shadow collector_ must

_[[spells/Expend|expend]]_ 1 _shadow_ point to use any of its _spell-like abilities_. A

_shadow collector_ generally begins an encounter with 1d3+1

_shadow_ points. A _shadow collector_ can release a stolen

_shadow_ as a standard action. A creature can touch the _shadow_

collector to regain its stolen _shadow_, as long as the _shadow_

collector is _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ or dead. A successful _[[spells/Break Enchantment|break enchantment]]_

(DC 23) can also restore a target’s _shadow_.

**Tear _Shadow_ (Su)** A _shadow collector_’s claws strike as _[[monsters/Ghost|ghost]]_

touch weapons and, in addition to their normal damage,

deal 1d6 points of Charisma damage to _incorporeal_ creatures.

This damage destroys a creature if it equals or exceeds the

creature’s actual Charisma score.

##### Description

_Shadow_ collectors feed on memories and regrets sifted

from shadows. They often weave mortal shadows into

certain magic items such as cloaks and gloves. Some

_shadow_ collectors con mortals into selling their shadows

or resort to blatant theft; others prowl the Plane of _Shadow_

and the Ethereal Plane for shadows that are already lost.

_Shadow_ collectors favor spaces like the edges

of forests and foothills for the varied

lighting and for the numerous places

where they can f lank marks from

hiding or surprise them with pits

created by _shadow conjuration_.

A typical _shadow collector_

stands over 3 feet tall and weighs

40 pounds.
