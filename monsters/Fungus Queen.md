### Special Abilities

**Compel Plants (Su)** A _fungus queen_’s mind-affecting powers and _spell-like abilities_ (and spells, should the _fungus queen_ gain the ability to cast them) affect plant creatures (but not mindless plant creatures) as if they weren’t immune to mind-affecting effects.

**Create Spawn (Su)** A creature that would normally be slain by a _fungus queen_’s _energy drain_ attack is not killed—instead, it immediately loses all negative levels imparted by the _fungus queen_ and transforms into a fungus-infested minion in her service. Most creatures gain the fungoid simple template (see page 131), but vermin slain by a _fungus queen_ instead rise as spore zombies (see page 287). Fungoid creatures and spore zombies are under the control of the _fungus queen_ that created them, and remain enslaved until that _fungus queen_ is destroyed or until they are cured of the infestation. A _fungus queen_ can communicate telepathically with her fungoid spawn at any range as long as they are on the same plane. She can control a number of Hit Dice worth of enslaved spawn totaling no more than double her own Hit Dice. Any spawn she creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed fungoid creatures or spore zombies. A _fungus queen_ can free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a creature cannot be enslaved again (although fungoid creatures can still be influenced by the _fungus queen_’s compel plants and plant _empathy_ abilities).

**_Energy Drain_ (Su)** A _fungus queen_ drains energy from a mortal she lures into an act of passion, such as a kiss. An unwilling victim must be _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ before she can use this ability. The _fungus queen_’s embrace bestows one negative level and has the effect of a _suggestion_ spell, asking the victim to accept another act of passion from the _fungus queen_. The victim must succeed on a DC 23 Will save to negate the _suggestion_. The DC is 23 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. Creatures killed by this attack do not die—they instead become infested with the _fungus queen_’s spores (see Create Spawn above). The save DCs are Charisma-based.

**Plant _Empathy_ (Ex)** This ability functions as the _[[classes/Druid|druid]]_’s wild _empathy_ ability, save that a _fungus queen_ can use this ability only on plant creatures. A _fungus queen_ gains a +4 racial bonus on this check. Mindless plant creatures are imparted with a modicum of implanted intelligence when a _fungus queen_ uses this ability, allowing her to train them as guardians.
**Sporepod (Su)** As a standard action, a _fungus queen_ can cause a _Medium_ pod of fungal material to burst out of the ground at any point within 60 feet of her current location. Once created, a sporepod cannot move. If the _fungus queen_ travels more than 120 feet from a sporepod, it is destroyed. A _fungus queen_ can maintain a number of sporepods equal to her Charisma modifier (7 for the typical _fungus queen_). As a move action, she can instantaneously travel to one of her sporepods as if using _[[spells/Transport via Plants|transport via plants]]_. She can also choose to spread out her tentacle attacks among her sporepods, attacking a creature within 5 feet of any sporepod with a tentacle, though she is still limited to making only four tentacle attacks as part of a full attack, and only one as a standard action. A sporepod is an object with an AC of 15 and 20 hit points; damage dealt to a sporepod does not _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ the _fungus queen_.

##### Description

Hundreds of years ago, a cabal of powerful succubus assassins attempted to invade the Abyssal realm of the demon lord of disease and fungus. These succubi sought to slay a powerful _[[classes/Witch|witch]]_ who had befouled a profane temple the assassins served. The succubi failed at their mission, and from their corpses grew the first fungus queens. Pleased with this development, the _witch_ seeded numerous Material Plane worlds with _fungus queen_ spores, and these new fungus queens have taken to these new environments like rot to a carcass; today, hundreds of the subversive creatures dwell in the fouler reaches of the Material Plane. They are particularly fond of large cave systems and the slums of ruined cities. Fungus queens also often dwell in areas of corrupted woodlands where blighted fey rule, or in the sewers of active cities with an unusually large amount of magical pollution.

An encounter with a normally unintelligent plant monster acting in a sinister and organized way can be evidence of the manipulation of a _fungus queen_, but fungus queens are equally fond of commanding and keeping other creatures as pets and slaves—particularly attractive humanoids. Especially favored minions are given the gift of the _fungus queen_’s embrace and are transformed into fungoid minions forever loyal to their pallid mistress. Yet a _fungus queen_ knows that a diverse array of guardians is best, and is certain to keep some non-plant minions on hand to protect her lair.

Fungus queens are violently jealous and possessive. Those who attempt to lure away their charmed and dominated pets or cure those who have been infested elicit their eternal ire, but it is succubi that most enrage fungus queens. Whether this is due to a simple territorial conflict or some deeper hatred born of their unique genesis, a _fungus queen_ faced with someone whom she even suspects might be a succubus is a terror indeed, for in such battles the plants abandon their normal approach of subtle mental control and trickery, instead bringing all of their power to bear in an attempt to rip the offending creature apart. Fungus queens also take great and specific delight in transforming succubi into fungoid creatures under their control.

While their jealousy doesn’t compel them to do battle with other fungus queens, they are always careful to maintain their own territories apart from any nearby queens, and they take great pains not to “poach” from their sisters’ harems of charmed and infested pets.

Many fungus queens grow quite powerful over time, typically gaining class levels in _[[classes/Bard|bard]]_, _[[classes/Ranger|ranger]]_, or _[[classes/Sorcerer|sorcerer]]_— they generally do not become more powerful by merely gaining racial Hit Dice or increasing in size. _Fungus queen_ druids are remarkably rare.

A _fungus queen_ is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.
