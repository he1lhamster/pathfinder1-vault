    for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to that calpina's

  Calpinas are strange fey whose bodies have a combination of insectile and humanoid features. They view their victims as little more than sources of nutrition, but remain intensely curious creatures and may sometimes, albeit rarely, interact with other creatures without harmful intentions. 

  Calpinas make simple nests in hollow, rotting trees or shallow caves in cliff sides at the lower altitudes of mountains. Their social and territorial tendencies change with the seasons. In early spring, calpinas become largely solitary and nomadic, wandering in search of appetizing prey. A few months later, when they lay their eggs, calpinas band together into colonies of their own kind for mutual protection of their young. Once the eggs have hatched, though, calpinas welcome visitors, as their larvae require substantial quantities of food to grow. Small groups of calpinas called eclipses often work together to lure victims into ambushes, draining their egos to the last drop before leaving the comatose victims for the fey's mindless offspring to eat. 

  Calpinas are usually just over 3 feet tall, and most weigh only 25 pounds.

##### Description

Calpinas are strange fey whose bodies have a combination of insectile and humanoid features. They view their victims as little more than sources of nutrition, but remain intensely curious creatures and may sometimes, albeit rarely, interact with other creatures without harmful intentions.

Calpinas make simple nests in hollow, rotting trees or shallow caves in cliff sides at the lower altitudes of mountains. Their social and territorial tendencies change with the seasons. In early spring, calpinas become largely solitary and nomadic, wandering in search of appetizing prey. A few months later, when they lay their eggs, calpinas band together into colonies of their own kind for mutual protection of their young. Once the eggs have hatched, though, calpinas welcome visitors, as their larvae require substantial quantities of food to grow. Small groups of calpinas _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ eclipses often work together to lure victims into ambushes, draining their egos _[[feats/To The Last|to the last]]_ drop before leaving the comatose victims for the fey’s mindless offspring to eat.

Calpinas are usually just over 3 feet tall, and most weigh only 25 pounds.
