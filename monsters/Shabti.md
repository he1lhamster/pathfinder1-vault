### Special Abilities

**Immortal (Ex)** _Shabti_ do not age naturally

and can’t die of old age. While some might

come into being at age categories other than

adulthood, they never leave their original age categories.

Spells and effects that cause aging affect a _shabti_ as normal.

**Immune to Undeath (Ex)** _Shabti_ can’t become undead. Spells

and abilities that would transform a _shabti_ into an undead

creature have no effect.

**Past-Life Knowledge (Ex)** _Shabti_ remember bits of their past

lives. As a result, they treat all Knowledge skills as class skills.

**Resist Level Drain (Ex)** A _shabti_ takes no penalties from

_[[universal monster rules/Energy Drain|energy drain]]_ effects, though it can still be killed if it accrues

more negative levels than it has Hit Dice. After 24 hours, any

negative levels a _shabti_ takes are automatically removed

without the need for additional saving throws.
**Shattered Soul (Ex)** _Shabti_ who are killed are exceptionally

difficult to return to life. Anyone who attempts to return a

_shabti_ to life using _[[spells/Raise Dead|raise dead]]_, _[[spells/Resurrection|resurrection]]_, or a similar spell

must succeed at a caster level check whose DC is equal to

10 + the _shabti_’s Hit Dice. If it fails, the spell fails and the

caster can’t return the _shabti_ to life for the next 24 hours

(though the caster can try again after this period).

##### Description

_Shabti_ are facsimiles of wealthy or powerful mortals seeking

to escape judgement for their sins upon death. Grown from

_[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ bits of mortal souls, _shabti_ endure whatever cosmic

punishments or labor might await their creators in the

afterlife unless they’re discovered and freed by psychopomps.

_Shabti_ typically look like idealized humans with perfect

physiques and f lawless features. They

usually stand 6 feet tall and weigh

around 175 pounds.
