  Prostration (Ex): As a standard action, an ebon acolytus can attempt to force any
    creature it is currently grappling into a sacrificial position. The construct
    must make an additional combat maneuver check against its target to reposition
    it into an advantageous position. If it succeeds, and the victim remains grappled
    at the beginning of the construct's next round, the ebon acolytus may make use
    of its sacrifice ability. An ebon acolytus gains a +2 bonus on its CMB for the
    purposes of making this check if it is adjacent to an altar or similar site of
    ceremonial bloodletting.
  Sacrifice (Su): As a full-round action, an ebon acolytus may make a coup de grace
    attack with its dagger against any target currently grappled into place using
    its prostration ability. The target is affected by the coup de grace attack and
    must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die as normal. If
    the target is killed by this attack, his soul is sent straight to the plane of
    the being to which the altar is dedicated, regardless of alignment, and cannot
    be raised from the dead except by a cleric sworn to the same deity or by a miracle
    or wish spell. A creature under the effects of a protection from evil spell-or
    similar spell that opposes the alignment of the god the ebon acolytus is cra!ed
    to serve-may be resurrected as normal.
desc_long: |-
  Dedicated to dark gods, fiends hungry for the souls of innocents, and even more monstrous beings, ebon acolyti- sometimes called altar golems-are terrifying constructs, for they are not designed merely to kill, but to aid in the often bloody work required in the service of foul divinities. Carved from a single block of stone or other sturdy material, these constructs resemble towering statues, crafted to appear as servants of specific deities and often etched with icons sacred to their worship. In addition to its fearful body, an ebon acolytus is typically crafted with a companion altar, upon which it might aid its master or an unholy congregation in dark rites and ritual bloodletting.

  The exact height and weight of an ebon acolytus varies, largely depending on the shape of its body and the quality of the stone used in its creation, though most rise to around 14 feet tall and weigh around 2,500 pounds. Some carry Large sacrificial weapons other than daggers, but these prove rare and vary between faiths.

### Special Abilities

**Prostration (Ex)** As a standard action, an _[[monsters/Ebon Acolytus|ebon acolytus]]_ can attempt to force any creature it is currently grappling into a sacrificial position. The construct must make an additional combat maneuver check against its target to reposition it into an advantageous position. If it succeeds, and the victim remains _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ at the beginning of the construct’s next round, the _ebon acolytus_ may make use of its _sacrifice_ ability. An _ebon acolytus_ gains a +2 bonus on its CMB for the purposes of making this check if it is adjacent to an altar or similar site of ceremonial _[[feats/Bloodletting|bloodletting]]_.
**_Sacrifice_ (Su)** As a full-round action, an _ebon acolytus_ may make a coup de _[[spells/Grace|grace]]_ attack with its _dagger_ against any target currently _grappled_ into place using its prostration ability. The target is affected by the coup de _grace_ attack and must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die as normal. If the target is killed by this attack, his soul is sent straight to the plane of the being to which the altar is dedicated, regardless of alignment, and cannot be raised from the dead except by a _[[classes/Cleric|cleric]]_ sworn to the same deity or by a _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_ or _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ spell. A creature under the effects of a _[[spells/Protection From Evil|protection from evil]]_ spell—or similar spell that opposes the alignment of the god the _ebon acolytus_ is cra!ed to serve—may be resurrected as normal.

##### Description

Dedicated to dark gods, fiends hungry for the souls of innocents, and even more monstrous beings, ebon acolyti— sometimes _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ altar golems—are terrifying constructs, for they are not designed merely to kill, but to aid in the often bloody work required in the service of foul divinities. Carved from a single block of stone or other sturdy material, these constructs resemble towering statues, crafted to appear as servants of specific deities and often etched with icons _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sacred|sacred]]_ to their worship. In addition to its fearful body, an _ebon acolytus_ is typically crafted with a companion altar, upon which it might aid its master or an _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Unholy|unholy]]_ congregation in dark rites and ritual _bloodletting_.

The exact height and weight of an _ebon acolytus_ varies, largely depending on the shape of its body and the quality of the stone used in its creation, though most rise to around 14 feet tall and weigh around 2,500 pounds. Some carry Large sacrificial weapons other than daggers, but these prove rare and vary between faiths.
