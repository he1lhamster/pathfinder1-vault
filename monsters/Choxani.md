special_abilities:
  Discoloring Touch (Su): By making a successful touch attack, a choxani can feed
    on the color of living things. A creature touched in this manner takes 1d6 points
    of damage and must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or gain a negative level. Attempting
    to drain a target fascinated by the choxani's hypnotic colors ability does not
    end the fascination effect, though successfully draining the target's color does.
    The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Hypnotic Colors (Sp): As a standard action, a choxani can swirl its colors in a
    way that captures the attention of onlookers. This functions as hypnotic pattern
    (Will DC 14 negates), and the choxani's caster level is equal to its Hit Dice
    for the purpose of determining the total Hit Dice of creatures affected. A creature
    that successfully saves against this ability is immune to uses of it by the same
    choxani for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Pattern Reading (Su): As a full-round action, a choxani can let its subconscious
    thoughts form patterns on its skin, then interpret the results. This acts as augury,
    save that the chance of a meaningful reply is 10% times the choxani's number of
    Hit Dice, up to a maximum of 90%. Additionally, if a result would be ”nothing”-including
    as a result of failure- it is instead interpreted as one of the other three results,
    chosen randomly. The choxani has no way of knowing whether this ability has succeeded
    or failed.
desc_long: Also called “picture people,” choxani embody those aspects of nature that
  resemble other things, from a chameleon changing color to a cloud blown into the
  shape of a dog. Choxani see these moments of representation as proof of the plan
  underlying all reality, and honor them with religious fervor. They communicate primarily
  through hand gestures and their constantly changing markings, which can form text
  or images. When eating, the colors on their fingers or faces stretch out into funnels,
  sucking in the colors of other organisms and leaving them lifeless gray husks. A
  typical choxani is 7 feet tall and 150 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**Discoloring Touch (Su)** By making a successful touch attack, a _[[monsters/Choxani|choxani]]_ can feed on the color of living things. A creature touched in this manner takes 1d6 points of damage and must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or gain a negative level. Attempting to drain a target _[[conditions/Fascinated|fascinated]]_ by the _choxani_’s hypnotic colors ability does not end the fascination effect, though successfully draining the target’s color does. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Hypnotic Colors (Sp)** As a standard action, a _choxani_ can swirl its colors in a way that captures the attention of onlookers. This functions as _[[spells/Hypnotic Pattern|hypnotic pattern]]_ (Will DC 14 negates), and the _choxani_’s caster level is equal to its Hit Dice for the purpose of determining the total Hit Dice of creatures affected. A creature that successfully saves against this ability is immune to uses of it by the same _choxani_ for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Pattern Reading (Su)** As a full-round action, a _choxani_ can let its subconscious thoughts form patterns on its skin, then interpret the results. This acts as _[[spells/Augury|augury]]_, save that the chance of a meaningful reply is 10% times the _choxani_’s number of Hit Dice, up to a maximum of 90%. Additionally, if a result would be ”nothing”—including as a result of failure— it is instead interpreted as one of the other three results, chosen randomly. The _choxani_ has no way of knowing whether this ability has succeeded or failed.

##### Description

They communicate primarily through hand gestures and their constantly changing markings, which can form text or images. When eating, the colors on their fingers or faces stretch out into funnels, sucking in the colors of other organisms and leaving them lifeless _[[monsters/Gray|gray]]_ husks.
