  Adhesive (Ex): A mimic exudes a thick slime that acts as a powerful adhesive, holding
    fast any creatures or items that touch it. An adhesive-covered mimic automatically
    grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack. Opponents so grappled cannot
    get free while the mimic is alive without removing the adhesive first. A weapon
    that strikes an adhesive-coated mimic is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds
    on a DC 17 Reflex save. A successful DC 17 Strength check is needed to pry off
    a stuck weapon. Strong alcohol or universal solvent dissolves the adhesive, but
    the mimic can still grapple normally. A mimic can dissolve its adhesive at will,
    and the substance breaks down 5 rounds after the creature dies. The save DC is
    Strength-based.
  Mimic Object (Ex): A mimic can assume the general shape of any Medium object, such
    as a massive chest, a stout bed, or a door. The creature cannot substantially
    alter its size, though. A mimic's body is hard and has a rough texture, no matter
    what appearance it might present. A mimic gains a +20 racial bonus on Disguise
    checks when imitating an object in this manner. Disguise is always a class skill
    for a mimic.

  Mimics are thought to be the result of an alchemist's attempt to grant life to an inanimate object through the application of an eldritch reagent, the recipe for which is long lost.

### Special Abilities

**_Adhesive_ (Ex)** A _mimic_ exudes a thick slime that acts as a powerful _adhesive_, holding fast any creatures or items that touch it. An adhesive-covered _mimic_ automatically grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack. Opponents so _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ cannot get free while the _mimic_ is alive without removing the _adhesive_ first. A weapon that strikes an adhesive-coated _mimic_ is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 17 Reflex save. A successful DC 17 Strength check is needed to pry off a stuck weapon. Strong alcohol or _[[items/Wondrous Item/Universal Solvent|universal solvent]]_ dissolves the _adhesive_, but the _mimic_ can still grapple normally. A _mimic_ can dissolve its _adhesive_ at will, and the substance breaks down 5 rounds after the creature dies. The save DC is Strength-based.

**_Mimic_ Object (Ex)** A _mimic_ can assume the general shape of any _Medium_ object, such as a massive chest, a stout bed, or a door. The creature cannot substantially alter its size, though. A _mimic_’s body is hard and has a rough texture, no matter what appearance it might present. A _mimic_ gains a +20 racial bonus on Disguise checks when imitating an object in this manner. Disguise is always a class skill for a _mimic_.

##### Description

Mimics are thought to be the result of an _[[classes/Alchemist|alchemist]]_’s attempt to grant life to an inanimate object through the application of an eldritch reagent, the recipe for which is long lost. Over time, these strange but clever creatures have learned the ability to transform themselves into simulacra of man-made objects, particularly in locations that have infrequent traffic by small numbers of creatures, thus increasing their odds of successfully attacking their victims.

Though mimics are not inherently evil, some sages believe that mimics attack humans and other intelligent creatures for sport rather than merely for sustenance. The desire to completely fool others is thought to be a part of their being, and their surprise attacks against others are a culmination of those desires.

A typical _mimic_ has a volume of 150 cubic feet (5 feet by 5 feet by 6 feet) and weighs about 900 pounds. Legends and tales speak of mimics of much greater sizes, with the ability to assume the form of houses, ships, or entire dungeon complexes that they festoon with treasure (both real and false) to lure unsuspecting food within.
