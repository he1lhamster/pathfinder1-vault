    hallucinations. All creatures within 300 feet of a sargassum fiend must make a
    DC 18 Will save or become enraptured by the scent. An enraptured creature sees
    the monster as whatever would most compel it to approach. This might be a lost
    loved one, a child in need of help, an enchanting mermaid, the promise of dry
    land, and so on. The extent of this illusion functions as mirage arcana (CL equals
    the sargassum's CR), but is a mind-affecting phantasm, not a glamer. This effect
    ends immediately if the plant makes an attack against any target. The save DC
    is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  A sargassum fiend is a free-floating mass of intelligent seaweed capable of luring its victims to their deaths via a powerful hallucinogenic pheromone. Once the sargassum fiend lures prey within striking distance, it grabs the entranced creature and attempts to crush it to death. Experienced sailors tell tales of entire crews jumping overboard to swim out to a murderous field of the sea plants.

  The strange pheromone produced by a sargassum fiend can be harvested from the numerous bulbs that grow within the fiend's body, but these bulbs rot quickly once harvested. A fresh bulb lasts for 1 hour before becoming useless; until that point it can be crushed as a standard action to produce a mirage effect as detailed above. A single sargassum fiend generally has 1d6 bulbs of musk when slain-harvesting one requires a DC 29 Survival check. To date, no alchemical or magical process has successfully preserved this musk.

  Sargassum fiends usually reach sizes up to 10 feet in diameter before splitting, their means of asexual reproduction. Mutations have been known to exist, however, and sea-faring scholars have recorded individual sargassum fiends reaching masses of truly enormous size, up to Colossal. Such enormous sargassum fiends can be created by advancing their Hit Dice by a minimum of 5 HD per size increase step.

##### Description

A _sargassum fiend_ is a free-floating mass of intelligent seaweed capable of luring its victims to their deaths via a powerful hallucinogenic pheromone. Once the _sargassum fiend_ lures prey within striking distance, it grabs the entranced creature and attempts to crush it to death. Experienced sailors tell tales of entire crews jumping overboard to swim out to a murderous field of the sea plants.

The strange pheromone produced by a _sargassum fiend_ can be harvested from the numerous bulbs that grow within the fiend’s body, but these bulbs rot quickly once harvested. A fresh bulb lasts for 1 hour before becoming useless; until that point it can be crushed as a standard action to produce a _mirage_ effect as detailed above. A single _sargassum fiend_ generally has 1d6 bulbs of musk when slain—_[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Harvesting|harvesting]]_ one requires a DC 29 Survival check. To date, no alchemical or magical process has successfully preserved this musk.

Sargassum fiends usually reach sizes up to 10 feet in diameter before splitting, their means of asexual reproduction. Mutations have been known to exist, however, and sea-faring scholars have recorded individual sargassum fiends reaching masses of truly enormous size, up to Colossal. Such enormous sargassum fiends can be created by _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Advancing|advancing]]_ their Hit Dice by a minimum of 5 HD per size increase step.
