special_abilities:
  Blindsight (Ex): An argorth can ascertain the location of all creatures within 120
    feet. Beyond that range it is considered blinded. Argorths are invulnerable to
    gaze attacks, visual effects of spells such as illusions, and other attack forms
    that rely on sight.
  Constrict (Ex): An argorth deals 2d6+16 points of damage with a successful grapple
    check.
  Death Throes (Ex): When an argorth is reduced to -10 hit points, it collapses to
    the ground and thrashes wildly. It gets one final tail slam attack on every creature
    within 10 feet, after which it dies. It cannot grapple or constrict with this
    final attack.
  Fearful Shriek (Su): An argorth can emit a wholly unnatural shriek, a howl not of
    the mortal world. When an argorth uses this ability, all creatures within 100
    feet must succeed on a DC 21 Will save or be shaken for as long as the monster
    remains in sight. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. This ability does
    not affect creatures with more Hit Dice than the argorth. Whether or not the save
    is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same argorth's fearful shriek
    for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Ground Slam (Ex): As a full-round action, an argorth can lift its entire body into
    the air and slam it against the ground in a single, reckless attack. This attack
    deals 1d10 points of damage to the argorth, but all creatures within 5 feet of
    the monster are targeted by this +13 melee attack which deals 2d8+16 points of
    damage. Any creature standing within 10 feet of an argorth when it makes this
    attack (including those who might be damaged) must make a DC 23 Reflex save or
    be knocked prone by the sheer force of the blow. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Improved Grab (Su): To use this ability, an argorth must hit a creature at least
    one size category smaller than itself with its tail. It can then attempt to start
    a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins
    the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
  Swallow Whole (Ex): |-
    An argorth can try to swallow a grabbed Medium or smaller opponent by making a successful grapple check. An argorth that swallows an opponent can use its Cleave feat to bite and grab another opponent.

    A swallowed creature takes 2d8+8 points of bludgeoning damage and 8 points of acid damage per round from the argorth's gizzard. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 15). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out.

    An argorth's gizzard can hold 2 Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, or 128 Diminutive or smaller opponents.
desc_long: The horrifying, incomprehensible spawn of the Mothers of Oblivion, these
  titans of destruction are weaned on bloodshed and the dark dreams of Lamashtu herself.
  Nearly 30 feet tall, these marauding tentacles know only rage and slaughter, laying
  waste to whole regions, paving the way for their dark mistresses' hordes of ravening
  monsters. Unnatural disasters, argorths have more in common with hurricanes and
  volcanos than the beasts of the natural world.

### Special Abilities

**_Blindsight_ (Ex)** An _[[monsters/Argorth|argorth]]_ can ascertain the location of all creatures within 120 feet. Beyond that range it is considered _[[conditions/Blinded|blinded]]_. Argorths are invulnerable to _gaze_ attacks, visual effects of spells such as illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight.

**_Constrict_ (Ex)** An _argorth_ deals 2d6+16 points of damage with a successful grapple check.

**Death Throes (Ex)** When an _argorth_ is reduced to –10 hit points, it collapses to the ground and thrashes wildly. It gets one final tail slam attack on every creature within 10 feet, after which it dies. It cannot grapple or _constrict_ with this final attack.

**Fearful Shriek (Su)** An _argorth_ can emit a wholly unnatural shriek, a howl not of the mortal world. When an _argorth_ uses this ability, all creatures within 100 feet must succeed on a DC 21 Will save or be _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for as long as the monster remains in sight. This is a sonic mind-affecting _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effect. This ability does not affect creatures with more Hit Dice than the _argorth_. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same _argorth_’s fearful shriek for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Ground Slam (Ex)** As a full-round action, an _argorth_ can lift its entire body into the air and slam it against the ground in a single, reckless attack. This attack deals 1d10 points of damage to the _argorth_, but all creatures within 5 feet of the monster are targeted by this +13 melee attack which deals 2d8+16 points of damage. Any creature standing within 10 feet of an _argorth_ when it makes this attack (including those who might be damaged) must make a DC 23 Reflex save or be knocked _[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ by the sheer force of the blow. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Improved _Grab_ (Su)** To use this ability, an _argorth_ must hit a creature at least one size category smaller than itself with its tail. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can _constrict_.
**_Swallow Whole_ (Ex)** An _argorth_ can try to swallow a grabbed Medium or smaller opponent by making a successful grapple check. An _argorth_ that swallows an opponent can use its _Cleave_ feat to bite and _grab_ another opponent.

A swallowed creature takes 2d8+8 points of bludgeoning damage and 8 points of acid damage per round from the _argorth_’s gizzard. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 15). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out.

An _argorth_’s gizzard can hold 2 _Medium_, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, or 128 Diminutive or smaller opponents.

##### Description

The horrifying, incomprehensible spawn of the Mothers of _[[monsters/Oblivion|Oblivion]]_, these titans of _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ are weaned on bloodshed and the dark dreams of Lamashtu herself. Nearly 30 feet tall, these marauding tentacles know only _[[spells/Rage|rage]]_ and slaughter, laying waste to whole regions, paving the way for their dark mistresses’ hordes of ravening monsters. Unnatural disasters, argorths have more in common with hurricanes and volcanos than the beasts of the natural world.
