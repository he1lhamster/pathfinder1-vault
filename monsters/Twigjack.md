  Splinterspray (Ex): A twigjack can eject a barrage of splinters and brambles from
    its body three times per day as a standard action. This effect creates a 15-foot
    conical burst of jagged splinters, dealing 4d6 points of piercing damage to all
    creatures in the area. A DC 14 Reflex saving throw halves this damage. The save
    DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

Deep in old-growth forests, twigjacks spend their time tormenting intruders and wreaking havoc on settlers. Maladjusted protectors of the wood, these malicious fey constantly threaten any attempts to civilize the wild. Twigjacks delight in _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Breaking|breaking]]_ wagon wheels from expansionists’ caravans, snapping hunters’ bows, and sabotaging isolated cabins and villages. Although they possess a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Keen|keen]]_ intellect, few creatures, even other fey, can tolerate these twig-born creatures for long. Treants especially find twigjacks bothersome, and resent any _[[spells/Suggestion|suggestion]]_ that they are related. Equally,

twigjacks resent being considered plants, and are proud

of their fey heritage. Twigjacks sometimes go out of their way to impress dryads, an effort that is rebuffed almost every time. But some spriggans, quicklings, and other evil fey _[[feats/Associate|associate]]_ with twigjacks, and while goblins _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ and distrust the creatures, bugbears often bully them

into service.

Gnarled sticks bundled by vines and brambles form a _twigjack_’s entire body. Atop its head, a mossy growth not unlike hair sprouts. The creature’s eyes appear as vacant dark knotholes, and its mouth is just a canyon of splintered and _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ sticks bisecting its face. Leaves and sprigs of new growth randomly sprout from the creature’s body.
