  Critical Implantation (Ex): If a bonethorn scores a critical hit with any of its
    natural weapons, the victim takes a -4 penalty on its Fortitude save to resist

  Positive Energy Absorption (Sp): Those attempting to affect a bonethorn with positive
    energy quickly discover their mistake. Not only does positive energy heal the
    bonethorn (as it is a living creature, not undead), but it also absorbs the positive
    energy, boosting its metabolism. Whenever a bonethorn is affected by positive
    energy, it gains the benefits of haste and fast healing 5 for 1 round. This duration
    increases to 2 rounds if the bonethorn is not wounded at the time it is affected
    by positive energy. The durations from multiple exposures to positive energy effects
    stack.
  Spores (Su): Each time a bonethorn deals damage with its sporeladen natural attacks,
    its victim must attempt a DC 23 Fortitude save to avoid becoming infested by the
    fungus. If the victim fails, the fungus swiftly propagates through its body, erupting
    from wounds and ripping through undamaged flesh, dealing 2d6 points of slashing
    damage per round at the start of the infected creature's turn. A creature that
    has a skeleton and that dies while infested with bonethorn spores is consumed
    over the course of 2d6 rounds, after which a new bonethorn rises from the remains.
    A new bonethorn created in this manner from a Large or larger body can animate
    only a Medium-sized portion of the skeleton, resulting in strange, partially skeletal
    hosts that have similar statistics to a bonethorn grown from a humanoid host.
    Burning or otherwise completely destroying the victim's body before the spores
    complete their consumption prevents it from becoming a new bonethorn. This is
    a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
  Bonethorns form from bodies devoured and reanimated by a hideous, flesh-eating fungus. After consuming a creature's flesh, the fungus binds to the bones and takes the place of the body's muscular system. As the fungus spreads across the skeleton, it solidifies into numerous raised spikes used to implant fungal spores into other living creatures. Once permanently affixed, it uses the host skeleton to move around so as to spread spores and create more bonethorns. 

  A bonethorn has a rudimentary intellect, but spends most of its time seeking new hosts. When flesh isn't available, the fungus goes dormant and can remain so for hundreds of years. While dormant, the bonethorn is inanimate. As soon as the fungus senses life, it reanimates the skeleton-an action easily confused for a corpse rising from the dead. This can fool clerics into trying to turn the creatures, which absorb the positive energy to their benefit. 

  A typical bonethorn is 6 feet tall and weighs 60 pounds

##### Description

Bonethorns form from bodies devoured and reanimated by a hideous, flesh-eating fungus. After consuming a creature’s flesh, the fungus binds to the bones and takes the place of the body’s muscular system. As the fungus spreads across the skeleton, it solidifies into numerous raised spikes used to implant fungal spores into other living creatures. Once permanently affixed, it uses the host skeleton to move around so as to spread spores and create more bonethorns.

A _bonethorn_ has a rudimentary intellect, but spends most of its time seeking new hosts. When flesh isn’t available, the fungus goes dormant and can remain so for hundreds of years. While dormant, the _bonethorn_ is inanimate. As soon as the fungus senses life, it reanimates the skeleton—an action easily _[[conditions/Confused|confused]]_ for a corpse rising from the dead. This can fool clerics into trying to turn the creatures, which absorb the positive energy to their benefit.

A typical _bonethorn_ is 6 feet tall and weighs 60 pounds
