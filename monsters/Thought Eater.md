### Special Abilities

**Eat Thoughts (Su)** A living and corporeal creature that takes

damage from a _[[monsters/Thought Eater|thought eater]]_’s bite loses some of its

thoughts, as the _thought eater_ drains them to nourish

itself. If the victim is a spellcaster, she loses a single

spell prepared, or a single unused spell slot (if she is a

spontaneous spellcaster) of 1st level or higher. A spellcaster

chooses which spell or spell slot she loses from this ability.

If the victim is not a spellcaster or has no prepared spells or

unused spell slots of 1st-level or higher, on a failed saving

throw this ability instead deals 1 point of Intelligence,

Wisdom, or Charisma damage (victim’s choice). When a

creatures loses a spell slot or takes ability damage from this

ability, the _thought eater_ gains 1 PE (up to a maximum of its

total daily PE; 5 for most thought eaters).

**Ethereal Body (Su)** A _thought eater_’s skin and organs are

composed primarily of ethereal tissue. The _thought eater_

takes half damage from nonmagical weapons, but is

affected normally by magic weapons and spells. For every

minute the _thought eater_ remains on a plane other than

the Ethereal Plane, it must spend 1 PE or take 1d6 points of

damage as its body begins to dissipate.

**Ethereal Passage (Sp)** A _thought eater_ can move from the

Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a move action, and

can move from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane as

a full-round action. Moving from the Material Plane to the

Ethereal Plane costs the _thought eater_ 1 PE, although

moving from the Ethereal Plane to the Material

Plane does not. Both forms of movement

provoke attacks of opportunity.

##### Description

These tiny predators of thought live almost their entire

lives on the Ethereal Plane. They are so tied to that place

that without its energy, a _thought eater_’s _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ power

begins to deplete, until finally the very fabric of its own

personal reality breaks down and it fades out of existence.

But while the Ethereal Plane is necessary for thought

eaters’ continued existence, its vastness and relative lack

of prey force thought eaters to sometimes hunt on the

Material Plane. Such trips are often gluttonous affairs,

as the thought eaters must not only gain sustenance, but

also gain enough nourishment to stave off their rapid

_psychic_ and physical decay in that hostile environment.

Normally, thought eaters are fairly single-minded,

but the inherent danger in their forays to the Material

Plane makes them eager for easy meals. Someone who

takes the time to provide consistent easy meals for a

_thought eater_ can expect the creature to follow her on the

Ethereal Plane, watching for its next feeding time. Given

that every minute on the Material Plane is strenuous

for a _thought eater_, such a person is unlikely to receive

much conversation from the creature trailing her, but

if something threatens the safety of its food source, the

_thought eater_ may be moved to protect its companion. In

this case, the _thought eater_ uses its _daze monster_ ability to

help the person escape and may even be motivated to cast

_resist energy_ on her. If this bizarre and alien friendship

continues for long enough, the _thought eater_ may even

choose to assist in identifying magic items—when

properly compensated, of course.
