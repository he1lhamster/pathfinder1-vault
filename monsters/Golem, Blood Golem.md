  Blood Drain (Su): A blood golem heals 5 hit points each round it drains blood.
  Clotted Skin (Ex): A blood golem can congeal its surface into a hard skin as a full-round
    action, allowing it to assume a vaguely humanoid form. With its skin, it gains
    DR 5/bludgeoning, natural armor +6, and speed 30, but loses its amorphous and
    compression abilities. It can liquefy this skin as a full-round action, losing
    its DR and natural armor, changing its speed to 10 feet, and regaining the amorphous
    and compression abilities. The golem normally maintains its congealed skin, liquefying
    itself only when it has to pass through obstacles that would hinder its solid
    form.
  Immunity to Magic (Ex): A blood golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability
    that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
    differently against the creature. Cure spells affect it as if it were a living
    creature, but only cure the minimum amount of damage.Spells and effects that specifically
    affect blood (such as boiling bloodAPG) affect it normally.
  Vulnerable to Bleed (Ex): Bleed effects, blood drain, and attacks that target a
    creature's blood affect a blood golem normally. The golem can spend a full-round
    action to harden its clotted outer shell to end a bleed effect.
desc_long: A blood golem is an animate mass of living blood. It can creep about in
  liquid form like an ooze, or create a thick skin made up of coagulated blood that
  allows it to walk upright like a person.
