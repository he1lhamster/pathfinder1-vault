  Hypnotic Hood (Su): A psyche serpent can use the hypnotism occult skill unlock (Pathfinder
    RPG Occult Adventures 195) to implant suggestions as a full-round action (instead
    of taking 1 minute) an unlimited number of times per day. While it hypnotizes
    its targets, it sways from side to side with the spiral pattern of its hood fully
    displayed. A successfully hypnotized victim can recall this spiral pattern but
    otherwise has no memory of the act of hypnotism unless the psyche serpent wishes
    it to.
  Painless Bite (Ex): A psyche serpent's venom has a powerful numbing effect, causing
    its bites to inflict no pain and allowing it to inject its poison without alerting
    its victims or awakening them from sleep. Even if the victim succeeded at its
    saving throw, it remains unaware it attempted a save against a psyche serpent's
    venom.
  Poison (Ex): Bite-injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect
    1d3 Wisdom, and a creature that takes Wisdom damage from this poison is considered
    a willing creature for the purposes of the psyche serpent's hypnotism occult skill
    unlock until the Wisdom damage is healed; cure 2 consecutive saves. The DC includes
    a +2 racial bonus.
desc_long: |-
  The unique spiral pattern on psyche serpent's hoods mark them as something more than ordinary cobras. They are clever creatures with enough wit and magic to be dangerous. Though psyche serpents are solitary, they can not resist the lure of large cities, especially those rife with politics and scheming, which irresistibly call to them. Psyche serpents are cunning, patient, and manipulative, and enjoy seeing subtle, long-awaited plans come to fruition. They prefer to stay out of sight, waiting for the right moment to emerge and hypnotize the perfect subject. By drawing out secrets and forcing victims to act against their own will, psyche serpents enact their plots without ever being discovered as the true masterminds. Though their venom makes them dangerous, they are not hardy creatures and prefer to avoid physical combat.

  Some psyche serpents take on more official roles, acting as advisors and counselors to great leaders. Psyche serpents are fiercely competitive, especially with others of their kind, and rarely work together. They often take opposite sides of political conflicts simply for the sake of decent competition, finding almost as much pleasure in being outsmarted as they do from thwarting their rivals. A worthy rival is the greatest gift a psyche serpent can ever find, and they find the idea of eliminating their nemeses completely alien.

  Psyche serpents sometimes form strong bonds with those few individuals whom they see as mental equals, partnering with them as constantly competitive but loyal familiars. A spellcaster with an alignment within one step of true neutral who has the Improved Familiar feat and an arcane caster level of 7th or higher can select a psyche serpent as a familiar.
