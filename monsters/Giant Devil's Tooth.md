  Acid Rupture (Ex): If a creature damages a giant devil's tooth with a bludgeoning
    or slashing weapon, some of its red globules burst, dealing 3d6 points of acid
    damage to creatures adjacent to the giant devil's tooth. An affected creature
    that succeeds at a DC 16 Reflex saving throw takes half damage. The save DC is
    Constitution-based.
  Spine Spray (Ex): Once every 1d3 rounds as a standard action, a giant devil's tooth
    can spray a barrage of spines from its stalk, dealing 6d6 points of piercing damage
    to each creature in a 15-foot-cone burst. A target that succeeds at a DC 16 Reflex
    saving throw takes half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Spore Cloud (Ex): Once per day as a standard action, a giant devil's tooth can release
    a cloud of noxious spores in a 50-foot-radius spread centered on itself. This
    cloud lasts for 1 round before dispersing. Each creature that enters or begins
    its turn in the cloud must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw or become
    nauseated for 1d3 rounds; a creature that succeeds at its Fortitude save is instead
    sickened for 1d3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
  While mundane variations of this fungus exist in nature as small, fist-sized clusters that feed from the roots of host trees, the much larger, mobile giant devil's tooth seems to draw its powers from far darker sources. Some say the trees that give these fungi life contain the souls of ancient evil druids, imprisoned centuries ago for disgracing their circle. Others believe that devils themselves embedded infernal energy into the mushrooms while visiting the Material Plane, bringing these otherwise harmless hydnoids to life.

   A ruthless creature with many ways to incapacitate its prey, a giant devil's tooth often paralyzes its victims before slowly dissolving them for feeding. It crawls along the ground toward its quarry, and then rises up, revealing a large patch of jagged spines that it can eject in a devastating cone. When faced with multiple enemies, it releases a cloud of noxious spores before slowly moving in for the kill. The acidic globules that cover the surface of its cap provide it a self-defense mechanism against any would-be attackers that fight in close quarters.

   A giant devil's tooth can grow as tall as 24 feet and weighs 3,300 pounds.

##### Description

While mundane variations of this fungus exist in nature as small, fist-sized clusters that feed from the roots of host trees, the much larger, mobile giant devil’s tooth seems to draw its powers from far darker sources. Some say the trees that give these fungi life contain the souls of ancient evil druids, imprisoned centuries ago for disgracing their circle. Others believe that devils themselves embedded infernal energy into the mushrooms while visiting the Material Plane, bringing these otherwise harmless hydnoids to life.

A ruthless creature with many ways to incapacitate its prey, a giant devil’s tooth often paralyzes its victims before slowly dissolving them for feeding. It crawls along the ground toward its quarry, and then rises up, revealing a large patch of jagged spines that it can eject in a devastating cone. When faced with multiple enemies, it releases a cloud of noxious spores before slowly moving in for the kill. The acidic globules that cover the surface of its cap provide it a self-defense mechanism against any would-be attackers that fight in close quarters.

A giant devil’s tooth can grow as tall as 24 feet and weighs 3,300 pounds.
