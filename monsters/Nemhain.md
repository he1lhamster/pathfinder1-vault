### Special Abilities

**Bound Spirits (Su)** A _[[monsters/Nemhain|nemhain]]_ is

surrounded by a whirling cloud

of spirits that are bound to her—often the

spirits of close relatives or friends she had in life.

As a swift action, she can direct these bound spirits

to strike at any creature within 30 feet as a ranged touch

attack (with an attack bonus of +21). These spirits may

be used to cause damage as if the _nemhain_ had touched

the target with her _incorporeal_ touch, or they can be used

to deliver a _harm_ or _slay living_ effect. Using these spirits

to deliver one of these _spell-like abilities_ is a swift action;

the _nemhain_ does not need to take a standard action to

cast the spell-like ability, but it still counts against the

number of times per day she can use that spell-like ability.

The _nemhain_ can also send these spirits as a group up to 1

mile away to act as scouts; they have a fly speed of 60 feet

(perfect). She can observe and listen through them, but as

long as they don’t share her space, she can’t use them to

deliver ranged touch attacks. These spirits are _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Impervious|impervious]]_

to almost all attacks and magic, save the following: dispel

evil, _[[spells/Raise Dead|raise dead]]_, or _[[spells/Resurrection|resurrection]]_. Such spells cause the spirits

to _[[spells/Vanish|vanish]]_ and to be useless to the _nemhain_ for 1 hour. True

_resurrection_ makes the spirits useless for 24 hours.

**Profane _Regeneration_ (Su)** This ability functions like

_regeneration_ except the _nemhain_ possesses it despite the fact

that she lacks a Constitution score. A _nemhain_ reduced to 0

hit points is _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_ instead of destroyed while her profane

_regeneration_ is active. As long as her profane _regeneration_

is active, a _nemhain_ ignores all damage that would reduce

her hit points below 0.

**Rejuvenation (Su)** All nemhains are tied to

a ritual object used in their creation.

This object is typically a large _[[spells/Statue|statue]]_,

pillar, or monolith. Until this object

is destroyed, a destroyed _nemhain_

automatically rejuvenates back to

full hit points 1d4 days after she

is destroyed, always appearing

adjacent to her ritual object.

##### Description

A _nemhain_ is formed when a soul

deliberately assumes undead _[[spells/Status|status]]_

as a means of protecting a person,

object, place, or ideal. Often, a devoted

priest or ally volunteers herself

and her (often unwitting)

kin for _[[spells/Transformation|transformation]]_

into a _nemhain_ in order

to continue protecting her

home even beyond her death. The

blasphemous rituals used to create

nemhains are often believed to have

been lost.

While most _nemhain_ aspirants

are evil to begin with—such

individuals are often members of cults

worshiping deities of lost or forbidden secrets—

occasionally a goodly creature considers protecting a

site worthy of a corrupted, tortured existence. Such an

act, however well intentioned, is destined to damn her

for all eternity.
