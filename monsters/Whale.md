  Capsize (Ex): A whale can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge
    attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the
    captain's Profession (sail0r) check, whichever is higher. For each size category
    the ship is larger than the whale's size, the whale takes a cumulative -10 penalty
    on this CMB check.
desc_long: Whales are frequently hunted for their meat and the valuable oil in their
  blubber. Baleen whales have no teeth and attack with a tail slap; toothed whales
  like sperm whales instead attack with a bite. Whale companions are smaller species-rules
  for such companions are the same as those for orcas (see page 88 of the Pathfinder
  RPG Bestiary).
