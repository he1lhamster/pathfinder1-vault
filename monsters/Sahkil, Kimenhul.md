### Special Abilities

**Eternal _Fear_ (Su)** As a standard action, a kimenhul can

present itself in a terrifying manner to all creatures within

300 feet that can perceive it. Other sahkils are immune

to this effect. All creatures within range must succeed

at a DC 32 Will save or forever hold the kimenhul in the

darkest corners of their minds. Once per day as a free

action, a kimenhul can telepathically communicate with

a creature affected by this ability for 1 minute as long as

both creatures are on the same plane. For as long as the

creature remains affected by a kimenhul’s eternal _fear_,

each time the affected creature finds itself in a stressful

situation (such as combat), it has a 50% chance of being

_[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 1 minute as it recalls the horror of its encounter

with the kimenhul. This lingering _fear_ persists even if

the creature defeated or killed the kimenhul. This effect

is instantaneous and can be removed only via a _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ or

_[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_. This is a mind-affecting _fear_ effect. The save DC is

Charisma-based and includes the +2 bonus from the sahkil’s

emotional focus ability.

**Look of _Fear_ (Su)** A creature affected by a kimenhul’s

_[[universal monster rules/Gaze|gaze]]_ is _[[conditions/Paralyzed|paralyzed]]_ with _fear_ for 1d4 rounds as the victim

imagines its body being warped and transformed. Even on

a successful save, a creature is _shaken_ for 1 minute, and

creatures immune to _[[universal monster rules/Paralysis|paralysis]]_ that fail the save gain the

_[[conditions/Cowering|cowering]]_ condition for 1d4 rounds instead. While _paralyzed_,

the victim appears to those viewing it to transform into a

terrifying creature as ghostly appendages of bone and gore

randomly sprout from its body. Any creatures adjacent to

the victim must succeed at a DC 32 Will save or be _shaken_

for 1 minute. The ghostly appendages are an illusion

(glamer) effect. Spells that provide _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to _fear_, such

as greater _[[spells/Heroism|heroism]]_, are automatically dispelled if they

come within range of a kimenhul’s look of _fear_. The save DC

is Charisma-based.
**_Snatch_ Between (Su)** While using skip between, a kimenhul

can bring along any creatures grappling it or _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ by it,

with no saving throw. A kimenhul can use skip between as

either a swift or a move action.

**Unsettled Mind (Su)** Any creature affected by a kimenhul’s

spell, spell-like ability, or other effect with the emotion

or _fear_ descriptor (even those that have a lesser effect on a

successful save) takes a –4 penalty on caster level checks,

concentration checks, Will saves, and skill and ability checks

based on Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for as long as it

is affected by that effect and for 1d4 rounds thereafter.

##### Description

Kimenhuls prey upon the _fear_ of failure, and encourage

self-loathing. While all sahkils delight in spreading _fear_,

few can leave an indelible mark of terror on its victim like

a kimenhul. Among the strongest of sahkils, kimenhuls

rarely leave the Ethereal Plane. Aside from the sahkil

tormentors, kimenhuls are the eldest of all sahkils,

and some particularly powerful kimenhuls carve out

territory in the Ethereal Plane and rule over legions of

other sahkils in much the same manner. Kimenhuls that

achieve long-term control are outliers among their kind,

however, as the hierarchy among sahkils is more mutable

and f luctuating than the rigid order of devils or kytons,

or psychopomps’ strict adherence to the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Planar|planar]]_ order.

A kimenhul appears as three enormous, fused

humanoid skulls with mouths full of jagged fangs,

sitting atop an ever-shifting mass of limbs and faces.

These latter manifestations constantly try to _[[universal monster rules/Pull|pull]]_ free

of the kimenhul’s bulk, shrieking and wailing in _fear_.

Sometimes a creature gazing into this f luctuating horror

sees a face all too familiar—a scolding parent, an old

bully, or a lost lover. This may or may not be real, as the

terrifying forms stretching out from a kimenhul’s body

incorporate both images from the viewer’s mind and

those creatures that have _[[monsters/Fallen|fallen]]_ prey to the kimenhul’s

eternal _fear_ ability. A typical kimenhul stands 25 feet tall

and weighs roughly 10,000 pounds.

When a kimenhul telepathically communicates with

those marked by its eternal _fear_, it constantly reminds

them that they will never be good enough, and that

they are utter failures in everything they do. These

sahkils derive a perverse amount of pleasure from

these brief mental interjections, and those that

have made their horrific impression on large

numbers of beings spend hours of each day

engaged in this long-distance abuse.

This lingering torment often drives

a kimenhul’s victims insane, or forces

them into desperation as they attempt

more and more drastic means

to rid themselves of the sahkil’s

inf luence and predation. Many of

these victims end up in the care

of others, as their _[[spells/Paranoia|paranoia]]_

overtakes any ability

to care for themselves

and they constantly worry over

whether they can actually achieve

anything on their own. Doubt

and distrust seep into every

thought. The victim can’t

get the denigrating voice out

of his head, and self-destruction

seems the only thing that can keep

it at bay.

Kimenhuls don’t bother

with those they consider

“lesser” minds,

unless their

intention is to cause havoc

or rampant violence. They instead focus on instilling

_fear_ in the best and brightest they can f ind. Kimenhuls

appreciate a challenge and even dedicate themselves

to _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Breaking|breaking]]_ down creatures that are immune to _fear_

effects. Kimenhuls delight in tormenting the brave

and confident. These _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_ outsiders track down great

heroes and famed generals—women and men known for

courage and righteousness—and infect their otherwise

strong minds with the static of constant _fear_. Kimenhuls

share stories of their conquests with each other and any

allied sahkils, bragging about the reduction of onceproud

warriors to twitchy, _[[conditions/Frightened|frightened]]_ children who _[[spells/Jump|jump]]_

at the slightest noise.

In combat, kimenhuls combine the use of their spelllike

abilities and their physical might. Enemies out of

reach fall victim to a host of different effects meant to

frighten or weaken, while those nearby are at risk of being

trampled or snatched up by one of the kimenhul’s fanged

mouths. Kimenhuls sometimes _grab_ enemies with their

bite attacks and then use their _snatch_ between ability to

bring their victims to the Ethereal Plane.

Once back on the Ethereal Plane, kimenhuls

bring their kidnapped victims to their lairs,

where they and their sahkil allies subject

them to a host of frightening stimuli in

hopes of driving them mad. Some of

these victims linger in this prison

of terror for decades, while others

die from fright—or take their

own lives to escape the torture

of constant dread. Otherwise,

kimenhuls do their best to

keep their victims alive.

Kimenhuls generally linger

near those places on the Ethereal

Plane where a mortal

peering into that realm

might brief ly glance

upon their horrific

visages. Most

viewers only

catch a terrifying,

half-remembered

glimpse of the sahkil and

go on their ways, _shaken_ but unscathed.

Yet if the viewer looks too long into

that hazy realm, a kimenhul doesn’t

hesitate to expose the creature

to its look of _fear_ or eternal _fear_

abilities, or to attempt

to drag the victim

back to its lair for a

proper dose of terror.
