  Rage (Ex): A dire wolverine that takes damage in combat flies into a rage on its
    next turn, madly clawing and biting until either it or its opponent is dead. It
    gains +4 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, and -2 to AC. The creature cannot end
    its rage voluntarily.
desc_long: Dire wolverines tend to be even more territorial than their smaller wolverine
  cousins, and they defend to the death the areas where they choose to live, often
  selecting humanoid-settled regions as their own and then fearlessly tearing the
  settlements apart. Dire wolverines grow to about 12 feet in length and can weigh
  as much as 2,000 pounds.
