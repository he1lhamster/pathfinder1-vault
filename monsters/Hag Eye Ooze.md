    If the hag that created the hag eye ooze is part of a coven, the following spells
    have a 5% chance per caster level of operating through a hag eye ooze: detect

    and tongues. A non-hag that controls a hag eye ooze can't cast spells through
    the ooze, nor can it see through the creature, but it can target the hag eye ooze
    with a clairaudience/clairvoyance spell and view through it in that manner.'
  Suction (Ex): A hag eye ooze can create a powerful suction against any surface it
    climbs, allowing it to cling to inverted surfaces with ease. It can establish
    or release suction as a swift action, and as long as it is using suction, it moves
    at half speed. Because of the suction, a hag eye ooze gains a +10 bonus to its
    CMD to resist bull rush attacks, awesome blow attacks, and other attacks and effects
    that attempt to physically move it from its location.
  Transparent (Ex): A hag eye ooze is difficult to discern from its surroundings in
    most environments. A successful DC 15 Perception check is required to notice a
    hag eye ooze. Any creature that fails to notice it and walks into it automatically
    suffers damage as if struck by the hag eye ooze's slam attack.

  Some hags create hag eye oozes to serve as scouts and spies, favoring them over humanoid servants due to the ease of control. With their ability to blend in with their surroundings and climb nearly any surface, these creatures patrol the hag's lair and surrounding territory. Hag eye oozes seem to be imbued with a sliver of the cautious side of their creator's personality, watching intruders from a distance and avoiding combat unless directed to attack. Once given a command, these creatures pursue their goal mindlessly until a countermand is given. 

  Hag eye oozes have gelatinous, transparent bodies that can sometimes grow larger than 5 cubic feet, though most are smaller, taking up roughly half that space. To date, no specimens have been found weighing more than 500 pounds.

### Special Abilities
**Spell Channel (Su) **A hag creator of a _[[monsters/Hag Eye Ooze|hag eye ooze]]_ can see
through the embedded hag eye as if she were looking from
the ooze directly. This ability requires that the hag creator
and the _hag eye ooze_ be on the same plane in order to
function. If the hag that created the _hag eye ooze_ is part of
a coven, the following spells have a 5% chance per caster
level of operating through a _hag eye ooze_: _[[spells/Detect Chaos|detect chaos]]_,
_[[spells/Detect Evil|detect evil]]_, _[[spells/Detect Good|detect good]]_, _[[spells/Detect Law|detect law]]_, _[[spells/Detect Magic|detect magic]]_, _[[spells/Message|message]]_,
_[[spells/Read Magic|read magic]]_, and _[[spells/Tongues|tongues]]_. A non-hag that controls a hag
eye ooze can’t cast spells through the ooze, nor can it see
through the creature, but it can target the _hag eye ooze_ with
a clairaudience/clairvoyance spell and view through it in
that manner.
**Suction (Ex)** A _hag eye ooze_ can create a powerful suction
against any surface it climbs, allowing it to cling to inverted
surfaces with ease. It can establish or release suction as a
swift action, and as long as it is using suction, it moves at
half speed. Because of the suction, a _hag eye ooze_ gains a
+10 bonus to its CMD to resist bull rush attacks, awesome
blow attacks, and other attacks and effects that attempt to
physically move it from its location.

**Transparent (Ex)** A _hag eye ooze_ is difficult to discern from
its surroundings in most environments. A successful DC 15
Perception check is required to notice a _hag eye ooze_. Any
creature that fails to notice it and walks into it automatically
suffers damage as if struck by the _hag eye ooze_’s slam attack.

##### Description

Some hags create hag eye oozes to serve as scouts and
spies, favoring them over humanoid servants due to the
ease of control. With their ability to _[[spells/Blend|blend]]_ in with their
surroundings and _climb_ nearly any surface, these creatures
patrol the hag’s lair and surrounding territory. Hag eye
oozes seem to be imbued with a sliver of the cautious side
of their creator’s personality, watching intruders from a
distance and avoiding combat unless directed to attack.
Once given a _[[spells/Command|command]]_, these creatures pursue their goal
mindlessly until a countermand is given.

Hag eye oozes have gelatinous, transparent bodies that
can sometimes grow larger than 5 cubic feet, though most
are smaller, taking up roughly half that space. To date, no
specimens have been found weighing more than 500 pounds.
