### Special Abilities

**Nauseating Film (Su)** When a _[[monsters/Roiling Oil|roiling oil]]_ makes a successful

slam attack, it coats a portion of its target in a clinging,

reeking film. Creatures affected must succeed at a DC 19

Fortitude save or be _[[conditions/Nauseated|nauseated]]_ for 1d4+1 rounds. On a

successful save, they are instead _nauseated_ for 1 round.

This is a poison effect. Another creature can take a fullround

action to scrape off some of the film and reduce the

remaining duration of the _nauseated_ condition by 1 round.

**Rolling Inferno (Su)** _Roiling oil_ is both volatile and

flammable. Although the ooze is immune to fire and

electricity damage, any exposure to either energy

type, mundane or magical, causes it to ignite in an

explosion that deals 5d6 points of fire damage to

all creatures and objects in a 20-foot radius

(Reflex DC 21 half). When lit, a _roiling oil_

loses its nauseating film ability but

its slam attack deals an extra

2d6 points of fire damage on a

successful hit and the ooze gains

the _[[universal monster rules/Burn|burn]]_ special attack (Reflex DC

21 negates). Both DCs are Constitution-based.

While ablaze, the _roiling oil_ gives

off smoke that creates concealment in

the _roiling oil_’s space and 5 feet beyond. This

smoke functions like a _[[spells/Fog Cloud|fog cloud]]_ in the range indicated.

Water does not extinguish the flames, but any cold

damage or a _[[spells/Gust Of Wind|gust of wind]]_ or similar effect smothers the

flames. Otherwise, a _roiling oil_ burns for 1 minute before

returning to its original state. While the ooze is ablaze, any

additional fire or electricity damage extends the duration

but doesn’t cause additional explosions.

##### Description

A magical compound of pitch and _[[classes/Alchemist|alchemist]]_’s fire, roiling

oil is a volatile and dangerous ooze. It hunts in subterranean

tunnels and even city sewer systems and waterways for

animal and vegetable material to consume. Thick, viscous,

and resembling a glistening spread of black wax, _roiling oil_

moves slowly across f lat surfaces and up walls to find prey

it can batter with its greasy pseudopods. When a patch of

_roiling oil_ attacks, the process of stretching and shifting

its form to strike exposes portions of its interior mass to

oxygen. This interaction creates a pungent odor of oil and

rancid fat. A _roiling oil_’s strikes slather its targets in an

equally malodorous film capable of overwhelming victims

with nausea. A _roiling oil_ prefers to fully coat its prey in

this substance before it kills and devours them. Even more

dangerous, however, is the fact that creatures attempting to

_burn_ away a _roiling oil_ only make it more lethal. Even the

smallest _[[spells/Spark|spark]]_ or f lame can turn this voracious ooze into

a moving inferno against which only cold or strong wind

act as any protection. The ooze itself feels no pain from the

f lames and isn’t impeded by them, but such attempts can

result in burns to everyone and everything else in the area.
