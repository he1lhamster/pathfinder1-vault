  Freeze (Ex): A gargoyle can hold itself so still it appears to be a statue. A gargoyle
    that uses freeze can take 20 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as a
    stone statue.
  Opportunistic Movement (Ex): A mythic gargoyle can rapidly move to take advantage
    of an opponent's weakened defenses. When an opponent within 30 feet takes an action
    that provokes an attack of opportunity, as an immediate action the mythic gargoyle
    can expend one use of mythic power to move up to 40 feet, ending its movement
    next to the creature that provoked the attack of opportunity and making an attack
    of opportunity against that creature. The gargoyle's movement from this ability
    doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.
  Possess Statue (Su): A mythic gargoyle can expend one use of mythic power to possess
    and animate a Medium stone statue within 100 feet. The possessed statue functions
    as a non-mythic gargoyle and lasts as long as the statue is in range and the gargoyle
    concentrates. When using this ability, the gargoyle's actual body is immobile
    (as if using its freeze ability) and helpless. It can stop using this ability
    as a move action. If the statue is destroyed, the gargoyle's life force returns
    to its own body.
desc_long: A mythic gargoyle is a king or queen among its kind, usually gaining its
  power from an earth deity, a mythic gem embedded in its chest, or centuries of exposure
  to powerful magic. It has a distinct appearance, and other members of its wing slowly
  shift to match its look.

##### Description

Gargoyles often appear to be winged stone statues, for they can perch indefinitely without moving, allowing them to surprise their foes. Gargoyles tend toward obsessive-compulsive behaviors that are as varied as their kind is plentiful. Books, stolen trinkets, weapons, and grisly trophies harvested from _[[monsters/Fallen|fallen]]_ foes are just a few examples of the types of things a _gargoyle_ might collect to decorate its lair and territory. Gargoyles tend toward a solitary lifestyle, though they sometimes form fearsome groups _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ “wings” for protection and sport. In certain conditions, a tribe of gargoyles might even ally with other creatures, but even the most _[[conditions/Stable|stable]]_ alliances with a _gargoyle_ tribe can collapse for the smallest of reasons—gargoyles are nothing if not treacherous, petty, and vindictive. Gargoyles have been known to dwell in the heart of the largest of cities, crouching amid the decorations of stone cathedrals and buildings where they hide in plain sight by day and swoop down to feed on vagabonds, beggars, and other unfortunates at night.

The longer a tribe of gargoyles abides in a region of ruins or buildings, the more its members come to resemble that region’s architectural styles. The changes a _gargoyle_’s appearance undergoes are _[[spells/Slow|slow]]_ and subtle, but over the course of years, it can shift radically.

One unusual variant of _gargoyle_ dwells not amid buildings and ruins but under the waves of the sea. These creatures are known as kapoacinths—they have the same basic statistics as normal gargoyles, save that they have the aquatic subtype and their wings grant them a swim speed of 60 feet (but are useless for actual _[[universal monster rules/Flight|flight]]_). Kapoacinths dwell in shallow, coastal regions where they can shamble up from the surf to prey on those that reside there. They are more likely to form wings, as kapoacinths prefer group living to a solitary lifestyle.
