desc_short: A small, gaunt humanoid creature possessing an oversized saurian  head
  and a thick, powerful tail hovers in the  air, its tiny wings a blur. The creature's
  smooth reddish skin is covered in a maze of glowing golden runes. Its fingers and
  toes end in razor-sharp claws, and a wide mouth beneath incongruously intelligent
  eyes bristles with rows of tiny needle teeth.

  Spell Turning (Su): Spells that specifically target a crepitus devil that fail to
    get past its spell resistance are turned back on the caster. This effect is identical
