title1: Gigas Clam
desc_short: This monstrous clam's conjoined shells open wide enough to swallow a horse.
  Inside, two tubular siphons flank the thing's innards, which resemble a fleshy,
  vaguely humanoid woman, save that instead of a face, it has a singular massive maw
  filled with rows of ravenous teeth.

special_abilities:
  Devastating Bite (Ex): A gigas clam's bite attack threatens a critical hit on a
    roll of 19 or 20.
  Poison (Ex): Siphon dart-injury; save Fort DC 24; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds;
    effect 1d6 Str damage and paralysis; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  Siphon Dart (Ex): A gigas clam constantly rolls collected sediment and calcifications
    into needle-like darts it can eject through its siphons. A gigas clam can fire
    one of these darts as a standard action at a maximum range of 100 feet with no
    range increment, dealing an amount of damage equal to 2d6 plus its Strength modifier,
    and possibly poisoning the target.
  Siphon Jet (Ex): As a full-round action, a gigas clam can use its powerful siphon
    to move a creature or object at least one size smaller up to 20 feet directly
    away from itself or directly toward itself in a straight line. A creature trapped
    in this stream of water can avoid the push or pull with a DC 22 Reflex save. A
    gigas clam can also use this jet to propel itself up to five times its swim speed
    in a straight line, and can use its trample attack in conjunction with this increased
    movement. If at any point during this movement the gigas clam comes in contact
    with a solid object (such as a ship's hull), it deals 4d8 points of damage as
    it rams the object with its durable shell. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
  Commonly found only in shallow beds of sediment on the ocean f loor, the gigas clam is an unusual foe-one that often catches divers and sailors unaware when they mistake it for merely an oversized mollusk. Shining, misshapen barnacles cover a gigas clam's tough and distinctive shell, glittering nodes that attract curious fish toward the beast's side. Even larger predator fish such as marlins, tuna, and sharks can find themselves in the tightly clasped jaws of a gigas clam.

  Gigas clams are primarily sedentary monsters, content to lie in wait as prey inevitably wanders toward their seemingly harmless forms. Vast fields of the titanic bivalves can be found scattered along the ocean floor of the Inner Sea, feeding on fish and any debris that falls to the bottom, including shipwreck victims and castaways thrown overboard by pirates. If no food presents itself for some time, a bed of gigas clams either relocates or crawls toward land in search of a more dependable source of food.

  Gigas clams depart from their mostly passive hunting style once per year, when the bulging summer moon is at its fullest. Entire beds of the creatures propel themselves upward and burst through the surface of the water, attacking passing ships as well as coastal communities. During these times, gigas clams seek out their most favored prey: air-breathing humanoids. Using their powerful siphons to slam into passing merchant vessels and war galleons, the massive clams are indiscriminate in their search for humanoid f lesh. Though they are normally hasty and seldom use tactics to obtain their prey, occasionally a lone gigas clam uses its feminine figure to trick unsuspecting ships into gigas clam-infested waters. The clam and its kin ruthlessly ram the vessel until its contents spill into the open water.

  Once trapped inside a gigas clam's quivering and contracting musculature, victims are almost certainly doomed, as the clam's acidic innards swiftly melt and destroy anything within. When engaged in melee, a gigas clam can strike with both its fleshy siphons as well as its terrible foot, which terminates in a toothy maw that can deliver devastating wounds.

  Since gigas clams openly attack land-dwellers only during 1 month out of the year, coastal communities and fisherfolk dwelling near gigas clam beds know to prepare their ships and docks for the deadly onslaughts of these creatures. But even the most formidable defenses are not enough to hold back great numbers of the clams, and most find it easier to simply avoid settling near gigas clam fields. Particularly bold monster hunters and sages travel throughout the Inner Sea during the summer in hopes of spotting the slimy beasts, using elaborate charts and maps listing past reports of the creatures to pick which areas to observe. A few whisper tales of immense magical pearls buried within the clams, which they postulate are responsible for the clams' increased size and intelligence. Others propose that the monsters absorb a portion of their victims' intelligence and memories while digesting them.

##### Description

Commonly found only in shallow beds of sediment on the ocean f loor, the _gigas clam_ is an unusual foe—one that often catches divers and sailors unaware when they mistake it for merely an oversized mollusk. Shining, misshapen barnacles cover a _gigas clam_’s tough and distinctive shell, glittering nodes that attract curious fish toward the beast’s side. Even larger predator fish such as marlins, tuna, and sharks can find themselves in the tightly clasped jaws of a _gigas clam_.

Gigas clams are primarily sedentary monsters, content to lie in wait as prey inevitably wanders toward their seemingly harmless forms. Vast fields of the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Titanic|titanic]]_ bivalves can be found scattered along the ocean floor of the Inner Sea, feeding on fish and any debris that falls to the bottom, including shipwreck victims and castaways thrown overboard by pirates. If no food presents itself for some time, a bed of gigas clams either relocates or crawls toward land in search of a more dependable source of food.

Gigas clams depart from their mostly passive hunting style once per year, when the bulging summer moon is at its fullest. Entire beds of the creatures propel themselves upward and burst through the surface of the water, attacking passing ships as well as coastal communities. During these times, gigas clams seek out their most favored prey: air-breathing humanoids. Using their powerful siphons to slam into passing merchant vessels and war galleons, the massive clams are indiscriminate in their search for humanoid f lesh.

Since gigas clams openly attack land-dwellers only during 1 month out of the year, coastal communities and fisherfolk dwelling near _gigas clam_ beds know to prepare their ships and docks for the _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ onslaughts of these creatures. But even the most formidable defenses are not enough to hold back great numbers of the clams, and most find it easier to simply avoid settling near _gigas clam_ fields. Particularly bold monster hunters and sages travel throughout the Inner Sea during the summer in hopes of spotting the slimy beasts, using elaborate charts and maps listing past reports of the creatures to pick which areas to observe.
