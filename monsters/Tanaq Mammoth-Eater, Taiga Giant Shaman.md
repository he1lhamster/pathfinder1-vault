  home in Red Rune Canyon in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords when their preferred mammoth-hunting
  grounds started to reek foully of demonic taint. He wields his father's bloodstone
  impaler, one of the first of its kind crafted by his people, and his hatred for
  the Kellid raiders who years ago slew his family still burns fiercely within him.
