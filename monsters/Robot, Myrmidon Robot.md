### Special Abilities

**Laser _Rifle_ (Ex)** A myrmidon’s eye is an

integrated laser _rifle_ with a range increment of 250 feet.

**Quantum Lash (Ex)** A myrmidon’s two facial tentacles lash out

with surprising force, and are capable of extending up to a

reach of 20 feet. These lashes are primary attacks that deal

force damage on a hit. They resolve as touch attacks, but

the damage dealt is not modified by Strength, nor can it be

improved by _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_. A quantum lash threatens a critical

hit on a natural 19–20. A quantum lash that strikes a force field

or force effect has a chance to disrupt that effect. Against a

magical force effect like a _[[spells/Wall Of Force|wall of force]]_, the myrmidon makes

a special check as if it were casting _[[spells/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]_ against

the effect (CL 11th). Against a robot’s force field, the robot

struck must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or its force

field deactivates for 1d10 rounds, after which time the robot

reactivates at the same hit point total it was at before it was

deactivated. The save DC is Intelligence-based.

**Resilient (Ex)** Myrmidons receive a +3 racial bonus on all

saving throws.

**Rockets (Ex)** As a standard action, a myrmidon can fire a rocket

to a range of 800 feet. A rocket explodes on _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Impact|impact]]_ in a

30-foot-radius burst, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage and

6d6 points of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in the area

(Reflex DC 18 half). A myrmidon carries a maximum of five

rockets. It can replenish fired rockets at the rate of one per

12 hours, crafting new rockets from scrap metal and other

collected components. The save DC is Intelligence-based.
**Superior Optics (Ex)** Myrmidons see _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ creatures and

objects as if they were visible.

##### Description

Myrmidons are highly mobile robots programmed to patrol

the skies above important locations. They react with swift

violence, interpret anomalous sensory input as proof of

hostile intent and rain _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ on the offending

target immediately and

without mercy. Most

have been programmed

to communicate, but

they rarely hesitate

in their carnage to

do so.
