### Special Abilities

**Aura of Madness (Su)** Once per round, any creature within a 60-foot radius of the _[[monsters/Vespergaunt|vespergaunt]]_ must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or be _[[conditions/Confused|confused]]_ for 1d4 rounds. Once a creature successfully saves, it cannot be affected by the same _vespergaunt_’s aura again for 24 hours. As a free action, the _vespergaunt_ can suppress its aura. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**_[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|Damage Reduction]]_ (Su)** Weapons that are chaotic-, evil-, good-, or lawful-aligned overcome a _vespergaunt_’s _damage reduction_.
**Siphon Spirit (Su)** Any creature struck by a _vespergaunt_ must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or gain 1 negative level as the _vespergaunt_ rips away a portion of its soul. A divine spellcaster gains an additional negative level with each failed save. A creature killed by this attack disintegrates except for its eyes and strands of brain matter, which become part of the _vespergaunt_. Only powerful magic such as _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_, _[[spells/True Resurrection|true resurrection]]_, or _wish_ can resurrect a creature slain in this manner. The save DC is Charisma-based.

##### Description

Often _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ “heresy oozes,” vespergaunts are emissaries of the horrible god-things of deep space and are found primarily on befouled, remote planets.

A _vespergaunt_ is 8 feet tall and 6 feet wide, and weighs just 50 pounds.
