  Temperamental and avaricious, the behir spends most of its time slithering through the sandy hills and desert cliffs that make up its territory, preying upon all creatures who dare to enter its hunting grounds.

  While territorial and bestial in its fury, the behir is neither stupid nor necessarily evil, though its self-centeredness and tendency to lay claim to everything visible from its high lairs frequently bring it into conflict with other races. As such, a behir can often be bought off or reasoned with by those brave negotiators willing to get close enough to make their pitch. In these cases, a behir's tendency to attack first and ask questions later (or not at all) means that anyone seeking to strike a deal must bring powerful incentives and impress the behir immediately with his offer.

  It's often been speculated that behirs are somehow related to blue dragons, but the exact nature of this link remains unknown. Most dragons deny any such association and look down on the behir for its relative lack of intelligence-a snubbing that infuriates the already short-tempered behir. Thanks to this casual disparagement, many behirs carry deep grudges against dragons, and attack without pause any who cross into their territories.

### Special Abilities

**_Grab_ (Ex)** A _[[monsters/Behir|behir]]_’s _grab_ attack works against creatures of any size category. It can _constrict_ the same round it establishes a hold. On any round thereafter that it maintains its hold, the _behir_ can choose to _rake_ the _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ target or swallow it whole.

##### Description

Temperamental and avaricious, the _behir_ spends most of its time _slithering_ through the sandy hills and desert cliffs that make up its territory, preying upon all creatures who dare to enter its hunting grounds. The creature’s six pairs of powerful, clawed legs remain folded against its sides most of the time, only extending in combat to grapple foes or carry the _behir_ forward in a terrifying, low-slung gallop, or else when climbing the sheer cliff faces common to _behir_ lairs.

The average _behir_ is 40 feet long and weighs 4,000 pounds. In addition to the two prominent horns on its head, many have additional decorative spines at regular intervals along the central ridges of their backs.

While territorial and bestial in its fury, the _behir_ is neither stupid nor necessarily evil, though its self-centeredness and tendency to lay claim to everything visible from its high lairs frequently bring it into conflict with other races. As such, a _behir_ can often be bought off or reasoned with by those brave negotiators willing to get close enough to make their pitch. In these cases, a _behir_’s tendency to attack first and ask questions later (or not at all) means that anyone seeking to strike a deal must bring powerful incentives and impress the _behir_ immediately with his offer.

It’s often been speculated that behirs are somehow related to blue dragons, but the exact nature of this link remains _[[monsters/Unknown|unknown]]_. Most dragons deny any such association and look down on the _behir_ for its relative lack of intelligence—a snubbing that infuriates the already short-tempered _behir_. Thanks to this casual disparagement, many behirs carry deep grudges against dragons, and attack without pause any who cross into their territories.
