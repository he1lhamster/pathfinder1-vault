### Special Abilities

**_Breath Weapon_ (Su)** Once

every 1d4 rounds, as a

standard action, a _[[monsters/Uraeus|uraeus]]_’s

head can expel a 30-footline

of poison. All creatures

in the area are _[[conditions/Blinded|blinded]]_ for

1 round and must save against

poison (Reflex DC 15 negates both). As

a full-round action, a _uraeus_ can either expel two lines or

bite with one head and breathe poison with the other. Each

head tracks its _breath weapon_’s availability separately.

**Poison (Ex)** Bite or _breath weapon_—contact or injury; save Fort

DC 15; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; initial effect _blinded_

and _[[conditions/Paralyzed|paralyzed]]_ for 1 round; secondary effect _blinded_ for 2d4

rounds; cure 2 consecutive saves.

##### Description

Uraeuses are _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sacred|sacred]]_ river protectors that harry those who

dare threaten their waterways. Far from simply territorial,

these f lying serpents keep their rivers safe for travelers

and local communities as an act of devotion to their

mother goddess. When a group of uraeuses is too small to

handle a threat, they sometimes seek aid from adventurers

whose names are well known along their waters. When not

troubled by dangers near their nests, uraeuses often hunt

dangerous prey such as river beasts grown to monstrous

size. Uraeuses believe in just rule, and become infuriated

by attempts to corrupt local leaders. In times of unusual

danger, uraeuses may actively travel to a ruler’s side to

warn that ruler against those who would lead her into folly.

Uraeuses accept offerings from any who live near or

travel their rivers. In exchange, they teach allies how to use

the river’s bounty and how to best serve society. Patience,

industry, and a willingness to listen to others are among the

qualities they seek to instill in those who ask their help. In

addition, uraeuses are always _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Vigilant|vigilant]]_ in case a supplicant

turns out to be a useful servant for their goddess.

Most uraeuses measure nearly 7 feet in length, have a

wingspan of similar size, and weigh about 150 pounds.

Despite being a two-headed creature, a _uraeus_ speaks with

a single voice that emanates from both heads at once.
