**Mind Drain Aura (Su)** Any

##### Description

The tremendously dangerous _nulmind_ is a fungal creature

believed by many sages to have extraterrestrial origins. It

is drawn to areas of innate magical power or populated

by spellcasters, feasting off the magic in the area while

slowly wearing down the inhabitants’ mental faculties

with mind-numbing thoughts and images. Users of

_psychic magic_ prove to be favored targets, as their mental

energy is especially empowering to the fungi. A creature

that succumbs to a _nulmind_’s mind drain aura might

eventually become enslaved to the fungus’s alien will,

the _nulmind_ using such unfortunate creatures to draw in

further prey. A creature enslaved in this way is incapable

of seeing to even its own basic needs, becoming a simple

extension of the _nulmind_’s need to feed.

Left unchecked, a _nulmind_ rapidly depletes the local

wildlife, as its mindless servants starve to death. Animal

life provides very little sustenance for the creature, and

a _nulmind_ inevitably works to find richer sources of

intelligence and spell power to devour. This sometimes

leads the fungus to communities on the border of its forest

or to gravitate toward woodland-bound druidic circles.

Because of this, _[[classes/Druid|druid]]_ enclaves often actively

hunt and destroy these creatures before they

can wreak havoc on the local ecosystem.

Despite the fungi’s plantlike nature, most

druidic communities view nulminds as

anathema to the natural order.

Nulminds are fortunately rare, with

no documented culture or organization.

These creatures rarely work well in

concert, as each is ultimately selfish

and sees only to its own needs, draining

even its fellows without hesitation. Despite

their insatiability, nulminds seem to

lack a taste for the mental energy of fey

creatures. While the fungi still defend

themselves against fey creatures,

they go out of their way to avoid

areas where such creatures live.

A _nulmind_ moves by

compressing and shifting its

body, _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Creeping|creeping]]_ slowly like a

caterpillar. A _nulmind_ is about

3 feet long and weighs 50 pounds.
