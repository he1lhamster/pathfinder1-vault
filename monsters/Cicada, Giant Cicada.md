  Song (Ex): As a move action, a giant cicada can flex membranes in its abdomen to
    produce a loud and distracting sound. After starting its song, a giant cicada
    can maintain its song in subsequent rounds as a free action. Any creatures within
    30 feet of the giant cicada must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or
    be deafened for the duration of the cicada's song. Being deafened in this way
    doesn't make a creature immune to this effect, but creatures that were naturally
    or magically deafened prior to encountering this effect are unaffected. This is
    a sonic effect and the save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
  These arboreal insects are best known for leaving behind nearly perfect exoskeletons when they molt. Giant cicadas have a signature song that can be heard reverberating through forests in the evening hours. This song can be heard for miles and can be overwhelming up close.

  Giant cicadas live most of their life in nymph form underground, emerging as adults only after around 13 years. Sometimes an enormous brood of these creatures emerges at once, causing trouble for humanoids living in those areas. Some creatures that share territory with giant cicadas collect their molted exoskeletons and make armor and other items from the material.

  Giant cicadas are nearly 3 feet long and weigh up to 20 pounds.

##### Description

These arboreal insects are best known for leaving behind nearly perfect exoskeletons when they molt. Giant cicadas have a signature song that can be heard reverberating through forests in the evening hours. This song can be heard for miles and can be overwhelming up close.

Giant cicadas live most of their life in _[[monsters/Nymph|nymph]]_ form underground, emerging as adults only after around 13 years. Sometimes an enormous brood of these creatures emerges at once, causing trouble for humanoids living in those areas. Some creatures that share territory with giant cicadas collect their molted exoskeletons and make armor and other items from the material.

Giant cicadas are nearly 3 feet long and weigh up to 20 pounds.
