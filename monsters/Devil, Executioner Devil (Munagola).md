special_abilities:
  Enraged Warrior (Ex): A munagola has trained her mind and body to wreak as much
    destruction as possible, and as she causes bloodshed, she flies into a frenzy,
    hitting harder with each subsequent attack. Whenever a munagola hits with all
    of her attacks in a single round, she adds her Charisma modifier (+7 for most
    munagolas) to all weapon damage rolls until the end of her next turn. If a munagola's
    attacks reduce a creature to below 0 hit points, her critical threat range for
    all attacks doubles until the end of her next turn (typically increasing her battleaxe
    threat range to 17-20 and her gore threat range to 19-20). This is an emotion
    effect.
desc_long: Rare but long-existing members of devilkind, munagolas are the result of
  the single-minded ambition of Eiseth, the Erinyes Queen and Hell's Valkyrie. Shortly
  after she established her realm in Dis, Eiseth set about creating an army worthy
  of her rage and might. The result of fleshwarping and infernal tinkering that defies
  even the archdevils' scrutiny, munagolas combine the aerial strength and craftiness
  of erinyes with the sheer brute force of barbed devils, bone devils, and even pit
  fiends. It takes centuries to create one munagola from a progenitor erinyes, but
  once she's transformed, the devil is even stronger, more furious, and more determined
  to conquer Hell on Eiseth's behalf than ever before.
