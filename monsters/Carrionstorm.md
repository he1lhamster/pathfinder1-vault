  Where the dead walk, the carrion birds follow. In most cases, the unfortunate birds that feast on the remains of fallen undead creatures simply grow diseased and die.

  Carrionstorms are typically found near graveyards, haunted structures, or abandoned villages where ghouls have been active.

  Although the individual undead birds that make up a carrionstorm are little more intelligent than they were in life, as a whole, a carrionstorm forms a rudimentary hive mind that grants its members a slight bit more intellect than the typical bird. This not only allows the undead birds to utilize basic tactics, but allows rudimentary speech as well. Most carrionstorms understand a few dozen words in Necril, the language of the dead, and the sound of thousands of these undead carrion birds croaking out strange words can be truly unsettling to those who aren't prepared for the horror. This same hive mind allows necromancers to treat an entire carrionstorm as a single undead creature with regard to the effects of spells like command undead and control undead, or feats like Command Undead. The swarms make excellent scouts, and even better threats against small towns and superstitious communities.

##### Description

Where the dead walk, the carrion birds follow. In most
cases, the unfortunate birds that feast on the remains
of _[[monsters/Fallen|fallen]]_ undead creatures simply grow diseased and
die. Yet the flesh of some ghouls has an altogether
different effect upon such scavengers, and when they
die of the poisoned repast, they do not stay dead for
long. Alone, an undead crow or _[[monsters/Vulture|vulture]]_ is little more
than a hideous mockery, but in rare cases where
ghoulish activity is thick, entire colonies of carrion
birds can succumb to undeath, retaining their flock
mentality yet no longer seeking the flesh of the freshly
dead to sate their hunger. Carrionstorms, as these
flocks of undead birds are _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_, find brief respite
from their morbid hunger only when their meals are
warm and screaming.

Carrionstorms are typically found near graveyards,
haunted structures, or abandoned villages where ghouls
have been active. Many necromancers and cultists of
Urgathoa have a particular fondness for carrionstorms,
and since the birds have a strange respect for the
symbol of the Pallid _[[npcs/Princess|Princess]]_, rookeries of them are
often found roosting in the nooks of the goddess of
undeath’s macabre cathedrals.

Although the individual undead birds that make
up a _carrionstorm_ are little more intelligent than
they were in life, as a whole, a _carrionstorm_ forms a
rudimentary hive mind that grants its members a
slight bit more intellect than the typical bird. This not
only allows the undead birds to utilize basic tactics, but
allows rudimentary speech as well. Most carrionstorms
understand a few dozen words in Necril, the language
of the dead, and the sound of thousands of these undead
carrion birds croaking out strange words can be truly
unsettling to those who aren’t prepared for the horror.
This same hive mind allows necromancers to treat an
entire _carrionstorm_ as a single undead creature with
regard to the effects of spells like _[[spells/Command Undead|command undead]]_ and
_[[spells/Control Undead|control undead]]_, or feats like _Command Undead_. The
swarms make excellent scouts, and even better threats
against small towns and superstitious communities.
