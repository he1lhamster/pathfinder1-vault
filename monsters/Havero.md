desc_short: This massive mound of tentacles rises and falls, hinting at the breathing
  of a great slumbering beast below. Every so often, the tip of one of the glistening
  filaments twitches to life, spontaneously growing a razor-like feeler, horrible
  eye, or other alien appendage. The creature's body is a looming clot of these appendages,
  a twitching knot of wriggling matter.

special_abilities:
  Alien Mind (Ex): Anyone who attempts to link minds with a havero (such as via detect
    thoughts or telepathy) risks the trauma associated with tapping into its raw alien
    thoughts. Such an act forces the character to make a DC 36 Will save. Those who
    fail are permanently affected by a feeblemind spell (CL 20th). The save DC is
    Wisdom-based.
  Light Sensitivity (Ex): Haveros despise sunlight. Even when it lacks an ocular appendage,
    a havero is dazzled in the presence of natural sunlight or when within the radius
    of a daylight spell.
  Appendages (Ex): |-
    A havero can alter the shape of any of its hundreds of squirming appendages, specializing them into a variety of tentacular tools. A havero has 20 appendage points, which it can spend as a full-round action to create a number of specialized appendages not exceeding this point total. As another full-round action, it can withdraw its tentacles back into itself, dissolving them and regaining the points spent to create them. If one of a havero's tentacles is destroyed in combat, it immediately regains the points used to create it. For example, a havero could use its 20 points to create 6 slashing tentacles, a grasping tentacle, and an incorporeal tentacle; 4 brilliant energy tentacles; 20 reaching tentacles; or any other number of tentacles whose sum total is 20 points. Haveros typically manifest the following tentacles, although some might have the ability to create more more. The point cost of each tentacle is listed after each name.

    Tentacle (1): Grants the following attack-tentacle +23 (2d6+14).
    Ocular Tentacle (2): Grants +8 bonus on Spot checks per ocular tentacle.
    Slashing Tentacle (2): Grants the following attack-claw +23 (2d6+14/18-20).
    Armored Tentacle (3): Increases the havero's total natural armor bonus by +2 per armored tentacle.
    Grasping Tentacle (3): Grants the following attack-tentacle +23 (2d6+14); constrict (2d6+14), improved grab.
    Reaving Tentacle (3): Grants the following attack-tentacle +23 (2d6+14), rend 4d6+21; requires two reaving tentacles, both of which must hit the same target in the same round in order to rend.
    Acid-Spewer (4): 30-ft. cone, damage 6d6 acid, Reflex DC 36 half; each additional 4 points spent adds +6d6 acid damage and 10 feet to the cone's length.
    Poison Stinger (4): Grants the following attack-sting +23 (2d6+14 plus poison); havero poison: injury; Fortitude DC 36; initial and secondary damage 3d6 Wisdom drain. The save DC is Constitution-based.
    Incorporeal Tentacle (5): Grants the following attack- incorporeal touch +23 (2d6 negative energy plus 1d10 Charisma drain, can attack targets through walls and other solid barriers).
    Vorpal Tentacle (10): Grants the following attack-pincer +23 (4d6+14; on a successful critical hit, target is beheaded as per the vorpal weapon quality).
  No Breath (Ex): A havero does not breathe, and as such is immune to inhaled toxins
    and odor-based effects.
  Telepathic Savant (Su): A havero can transmit vague impressions of its thoughts
    across limitless distances to any creature it is aware of. A havero does not communicate
    using language and its thoughts are limited and often unintelligible to mortal
    minds. A havero contacting a creature using this ability does not subject the
    target to its alien mind.
desc_long: The word “havero” has its roots in ancient Thassilonian, roughly translating
  into “smothering arms.” The creature itself was first described in notes and theories
  postulated by ancient students of the stars and delvers into dark lore. Horrifically,
  haveros are not the mere imaginings of those sages who chronicle the heavens. They
  are entities of deepest blackness, and on terrible occasions a lone havero has been
  drawn to Golarion, putting all the races of the world into reach of its endless,
  ruinous arms.
