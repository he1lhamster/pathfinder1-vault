### Special Abilities

**Bone Chariot (Su)** An _[[monsters/Ostovite|ostovite]]_ presented with a

corpse that in life had 2 Hit Dice or fewer (not

counting Hit Dice from class levels) and that

contains a skeletal structure can spend

1 hour extracting the bones and then

softening and reweaving them around

itself, creating a deformed and skeletal

version of the original creature. This

“bone chariot” functions as if the corpse had

reanimated and gained the skeleton template, but gains the construct type instead

of the undead type and has no will of its

own—it moves and attacks at the direction

of the _ostovite_, which rides in its center.

An _ostovite_ cannot use its own attacks

while ensconced in its bone chariot,

and damage done to a bone chariot

does not _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ the _ostovite_ until

the bone chariot has been

reduced to 0 hit points, at which

point the skeleton crumbles

and the _ostovite_ can attack

and be attacked as normal.

Multiple ostovites can combine their abilities to animate

the skeletons of larger creatures, so long as they all ride

within the same bone chariot—each additional _ostovite_

increases the maximum Hit Dice of the corpse that can be

_[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Animated|animated]]_ by this ability by 2.

##### Description

Tiny Abyssal scavengers, ostovites skitter across demonic

battlefields, amid charnel pits, and through that plane’s

festering sewers looking for corpses on which to feed. When

they find these morsels, they use their acidic saliva to digest

the f lesh, taking what they need for sustenance. Yet what

ostovites truly desire is not food, but self-improvement.

Though only barely intelligent, ostovites have a deepseated

jealousy of larger races, as well as an instinctive

shame regarding their own forms, which resemble

silverfish made out of thin, compressed bones. When

an _ostovite_ locates the corpse of a larger creature—

particularly that of a humanoid or other intelligent

being—it doesn’t stop at feeding. Instead, as soon as it

has sated its hunger, it begins using its acid to soften the

creature’s bones, drawing them out and reconstructing

them into a twisted parody of their original configuration,

with the _ostovite_ resting in a nest-like structure in the

sculpture’s center. Once it’s finished, the _ostovite_ magically

animates its creation, controlling it like a puppet and at

last experiencing the thrill of being larger and—to the

_ostovite_’s mind—more important. These ghastly creations

are generally more disturbing than normal undead,

as ostovites’ understanding of biomechanics is often

crude, potentially resulting in humanoid

skeletons that move around on all fours

or drag themselves along like landbound

octopuses. Like _[[npcs/Hermit|hermit]]_ crabs

changing shells, ostovites regularly

replace their chariots in order

to increase their social _[[spells/Status|status]]_

and impress potential mates.

Though they often squabble

over smaller skeletons, when

a particularly prime corpse is

located, an entire nest of ostovites

may band together to create a single

bone chariot of epic proportions.

Adult ostovites are 2 feet long and

weigh 3 pounds. Natural cowards

except when enshrined in their

chariots—at which point most

believe themselves invincible—

ostovites have a species-wide

hatred of the more powerful

vermlek demons, with

whom they often compete

for quality corpses.
