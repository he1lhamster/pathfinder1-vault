  Bardic Magic (Su): Each day, the Spirit can cast any three bard spells of any level
    and in any combination (caster level 16th).
  Inspiration (Su): The Spirit of Adoration can inspire an intelligent creature by
    giving it a token of her favor. As long as the creature carries her token, it
    gains a +4 insight bonus on all Will saving throws, Craft checks, and Perform
    checks. An inspired bard adds the spirit's Charisma bonus (+6) to his number of
    bardic performance rounds per day. The spirit retains a link to her token and
    its carrier as if she had cast the spell status on the carrier. The spirit can
    end this effect at any time as a free action. The spirit may inspire a number
    of creatures at a time equal to her Charisma bonus.
  Stunning Ray (Su): This ray of brilliant energy has a range of 180 feet. The target
    takes 1d8 points of damage and is stunned for 1d6 rounds (Will DC 24 reduces this
    to dazzled). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Unearthly Grace (Su): The spirit adds her Charisma modifier as a racial bonus on
    all her saving throws, as well as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.
desc_long: The Spirit of Adoration is a personification of resolute love, whose power
  lifts the heaviest heart and overcomes all obstacles. Her true form is that of a
  10-foot-tall, angel-winged woman dressed in flowing clothes and bearing a shining
  steel glaive.
