  Steal Skin (Su): As a full-round action, a skin stealer may steal the skin of a
    creature of Small, Medium, or Large size with a roughly humanoid shape. The target
    creature must be dead, helpless, or willing. If the target creature is alive,
    the skin stealer must make a successful coup de grace attack to steal its skin.
    The skin stealer can don or remove a stolen skin as a move action. When wearing
    a stolen skin, the skin stealer takes on the likeness of the skin's original owner,
    including the victim's voice, build, and size, but gains none of the creature's
    abilities. The stolen skin grants the skin stealer a +10 bonus on Disguise checks,
    with none of the usual penalties for different gender, race, age, and size. Stolen
    skins are preserved and remain as supple as living skin. A skin stealer may only
    steal and use a number of skins equal to its Charisma score. The skin stealer
    may choose to discard unwanted skins to make room for new ones at any time; discarded
    skins rot and decay normally.
desc_long: |-
  A sadistic being from the realm of the fey, a skin stealer is a terrifying sight to behold. These blood-red creatures resemble horrid, emaciated humans without skin, their yellowish eyes and teeth suggesting malnourishment or disease. Skin stealers suffer from no ailment, however, except for their insatiable lust for chaos and their hunger for flesh.

  Hailing from the First World, skin stealers are fey bent on destruction and gruesome murder. When left to their own devices, these gangly beings are unpredictable and spontaneous; when assigned duties from some higher, stronger power, however, skin stealers prove adept at performing complex assassinations and spy work.

  A skin stealer is a little over 6 feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds, though it can adjust its size to inhabit many different creatures' skins.

##### Description

A sadistic being from the realm of the fey, a _skin stealer_ is a terrifying sight to behold. These blood-red creatures resemble horrid, emaciated humans without skin, their yellowish eyes and teeth suggesting malnourishment or disease. Skin stealers suffer from no ailment, however, except for their insatiable lust for chaos and their _[[spells/Hunger For Flesh|hunger for flesh]]_.

Hailing from the First World, skin stealers are fey bent on _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ and gruesome murder. When left to their own devices, these gangly beings are unpredictable and spontaneous; when assigned duties from some higher, stronger power, however, skin stealers prove adept at performing complex assassinations and spy work.

A _skin stealer_ is a little over 6 feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds, though it can adjust its size to inhabit many different creatures’ skins.
