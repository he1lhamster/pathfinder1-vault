  Summon Pack (Su): Once per day as a standard action, a wild hunt hound can let forth
    a mighty howl, summoning a fog that coalesces into spectral dogs. The fog surrounds
    the wild hound in a 20-foot radius, traveling with the hound as it moves for 10
    minutes. The spectral hounds provide concealment as per the spell fog cloud and
    grant the wild hunt hound a +4 circumstance bonus on its combat maneuver checks
    to trip opponents. They also harry their foes with a relentless assault of bite
    and claw attacks. Any enemy that ends its turn within the fog takes 2d6 points
    of slashing damage (Reflex DC 20 half). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Track (Ex): A wild hunt hound adds a bonus equal to half its Hit Dice on Survival
    checks to follow tracks (+7 for a typical wild hunt hound).
  Wild Hunt Link (Su): All creatures in a wild hunt hound's wild hunt link share some
    if its sensory abilities, gaining blindsense 60 feet, greater arcane sight, and
    see invisibility
desc_long: |-
  Wild hunt hounds are expert trackers that take the lead against elusive prey. When left to their own devices, they seek out creatures that are notoriously difficult to track, collecting minor trinkets as trophies of their achievements (using their mage hand ability to carry their prizes home or to adorn themselves if possible). While they can be competitive when engaged in separate tasks, wild hunt hounds working together on a hunt never allow these rivalries to become a distraction. 

  These fey hounds are never truly alone, as they are always surrounded with green mist composed of fragments of the spirits of the wild hunt's victims. Stripped of all thoughts beyond a desire to chase and hunt, this fog eagerly answers the hound's baying call and forms into dogs that loyally fight at the hound's side. 

  Although the hounds of the wild hunt may seem outwardly to be mere animals, they are quite intelligent. Wild hunt hounds are fond of taking advantage of their bestial appearance, and when left as guardians or allowed to wander freely, make excellent spies among those who don't recognize the creatures' ability to understand language. When not tracking a quarry, wild hunt hounds enjoy relaxing and capering in any natural environment-but even in their play they engage in complex pursuits, testing each other's ability to track and evade simultaneously.

##### Description

Wild hunt hounds are expert trackers that take the lead against elusive prey. When left to their own devices, they seek out creatures that are notoriously difficult to track, collecting minor trinkets as trophies of their achievements (using their _mage hand_ ability to carry their prizes home or to adorn themselves if possible). While they can be competitive when engaged in separate tasks, wild hunt hounds working together on a hunt never allow these rivalries to become a _[[universal monster rules/Distraction|distraction]]_.

These fey hounds are never truly alone, as they are always surrounded with green mist composed of fragments of the spirits of the wild hunt’s victims. Stripped of all thoughts beyond a desire to chase and hunt, this fog eagerly answers the hound’s baying call and forms into dogs that loyally fight at the hound’s side.

Although the hounds of the wild hunt may seem outwardly to be mere animals, they are quite intelligent. Wild hunt hounds are fond of taking advantage of their bestial appearance, and when left as guardians or allowed to wander freely, make excellent spies among those who don’t recognize the creatures’ ability to understand language. When not tracking a quarry, wild hunt hounds enjoy relaxing and capering in any natural environment—but even in their play they engage in complex pursuits, testing each other’s ability to track and evade simultaneously.
