  Hailstorm (Su): A hala can call down hailstones from surrounding clouds once every
    1d4 rounds as a standard action. These hailstones deal 1d6 points of bludgeoning
    damage and 1d6 points of cold damage to all creatures within a 20-foot radius
    that have no overhead cover. A DC 14 Reflex save halves this damage. The save
    DC is Constitution-based. To use this ability, the hala must be outside and there
    must be clouds in the sky.
  Stormwind Aura (Su): Halas surround themselves with a buffeting shroud of supernatural,
    windstorm-force winds. These winds shield a hala from any other wind effects and
    form a shell of breathable air around it, allowing the hala to breathe underwater.
    Ranged weapons and gases directed toward a hala are affected as the spell wind
    wall.
  Vengeful Wind (Su): Anytime a hala takes damage from a critical hit, a powerful
    blast of wind explodes forth in the direction of the attacker. This blast takes
    the form of a 60-foot-long gale, treated as a gust of wind spell, directed from
    the hala toward the opponent that scored the critical hit against it (if that
    creature is more than 60 feet away, the wind is aimed in its direction but doesn't
    come close enough to affect it). This wind is also charged with electricity. Any
    creature in or that enters the area of effect must make a DC 14 Reflex save or
    take 3d6 points of electricity damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
  Hala demons are commonly known as storm demons. Bound to service by Pazuzu, these demons ride the winds across the Abyssal skies, lurk within dark and turbulent clouds, and act as his scouts and spies. Halas have a single, blood-red eye, an enormous mouth lined with razor-sharp teeth, and lengthy horns growing from their heads.

  A typical hala stands 7 feet tall, weighs 200 pounds, and possesses large wings that span 20 feet across.
