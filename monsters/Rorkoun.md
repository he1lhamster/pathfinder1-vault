desc_short: A large amber eye tops a swollen head, surrounded evenly by four mouths
  loaded with needle-sharp teeth. This enormously long, yet slender creature stretches
  the length of five men and appears to be composed of twisted strands of pallid flesh
  and veiny musculature. The tentacle-like thing moves with the awkward, alien speed
  of a hunting insect, unnaturally still one moment and darting forth with incredible
  speed the next.

  Aquatic Dependency (Ex): A rorkoun violently dehydrates as soon as its body is wholly
    removed from water. Every round that part of a rorkoun's space does not occupy
    the same square as a significant body of water (50 gallons or more), the creature
    takes damage equal to the number of rounds it has been outside water. The rorkoun
    stops taking damage as soon as it reenters the water.
  Gob (Ex): A rorkoun can spit a wad of viscous slaver at its prey. As a standard
    action, the rorkoun can make a ranged touch attack at a single creature up to
    30 feet away. Creatures of Large size or smaller that are struck by the attack
    must succeed on a DC 18 Reflex save or become entangled. Flying creatures that
    fail their Reflex save fall to the ground. An entangled creature can escape by
    making a DC 18 Escape Artist or Strength check. Should an entangled target take
    any amount of acid damage, the sticky saliva is instantly dissolved. The save,
    skill, and ability check DCs are Constitution-based.
  Squeeze (Ex): Able to manipulate the shape of its highly malleable body, a rorkoun
    can easily slip through spaces not normally accessible to a creature of its size.
    For the purposes of determining how small a space a rorkoun can squeeze through,
    treat it as one size category smaller. A rorkoun can move into even smaller spaces
    by contracting, allowing it to treat its size as two size categories smaller.

  Little-known denizens of the Darklands, rorkouns prey upon the unwary from lairs amid the deepest pools and waterways. Known as “wretch worms” and “eyes of Orv,” these disgusting abominations writhe through flooded pits and crevices, feeding upon nearly all they encounter and occasionally breaking forth from the depths into the world of light to glut themselves upon the plump, tender creatures found there.

  Rorkouns measure over 25 feet in length, and beneath the strange secretions that provide them with a false, apparent bulk, the creatures possess a ribbon-thin body only a foot wide. A typical rorkoun weighs a mere 200 pounds.

##### Description

Little-known denizens of the Darklands, rorkouns prey upon the unwary from lairs amid the deepest pools and waterways. Known as “wretch worms” and “eyes of Orv,” these disgusting abominations writhe through flooded pits and crevices, feeding upon nearly all they encounter and occasionally _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Breaking|breaking]]_ forth from the depths into the world of light to glut themselves upon the plump, tender creatures found there.

Rorkouns measure over 25 feet in length, and beneath the strange secretions that provide them with a false, apparent bulk, the creatures possess a ribbon-thin body only a foot wide. A typical _rorkoun_ weighs a mere 200 pounds.
