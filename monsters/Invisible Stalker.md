  Very little is known about these enigmatic and mysterious creatures, as their very nature makes details of their true form difficult to discern. Brought to this world from the Plane of Air, these creatures fulfill tasks for those who conjure them. Invisible stalkers act as guardians, assassins, and trackers, occupations in which they excel. Their natural invisibility and skill at stealth allow them to follow their quarry without detection and give them the upper hand when it comes to exterminating a mark.

  Many invisible stalkers resent this and see these petty tasks as nothing more than chores dictated by mortals. When given a particularly complex or bothersome task, an invisible stalker seeks to find a loophole in a poorly worded instruction. For instance, wizards calling an invisible stalker into service with the instructions “protect me from danger” might find themselves escorted to a faraway hidden location, or even brought to the Plane of Air.

  Due to their constant summoning, many invisible stalkers harbor hostility for those dwelling on the Material Plane. Those invisible stalkers new to the mortal world only know the stories of their kind and tend to keep an open mind about the intentions of those who call them. Over time, or in the service of a particularly vile master, invisible stalkers form negative opinions of these creatures of flesh and bone, leading to their tendency to pervert their instructions and cause harm to their masters. For older and more experienced invisible stalkers, the only thing protecting those who summon them is the magic that binds them. These creatures automatically try to use inconsistencies in the wording of their tasks and literal twists on the intention to find a way to inconvenience, injure, or even kill the priest or arcanist that brought them to the plane.

##### Description

Very little is known about these enigmatic and mysterious creatures, as their very nature makes details of their _true form_ difficult to discern. Brought to this world from the Plane of Air, these creatures fulfill tasks for those who conjure them. _Invisible_ stalkers act as guardians, assassins, and trackers, occupations in which they excel. Their _natural invisibility_ and skill at stealth allow them to follow their quarry without detection and give them the upper hand when it comes to exterminating a mark.

Many _invisible_ stalkers resent this and see these petty tasks as nothing more than chores dictated by mortals. When given a particularly complex or bothersome task, an _invisible stalker_ seeks to find a loophole in a poorly worded instruction. For instance, wizards calling an _invisible stalker_ into service with the instructions “protect me from danger” might find themselves escorted to a faraway hidden location, or even brought to the Plane of Air.

Due to their constant summoning, many _invisible_ stalkers harbor hostility for those dwelling on the Material Plane. Those _invisible_ stalkers new to the mortal world only know the stories of their kind and tend to keep an open mind about the intentions of those who call them. Over time, or in the service of a particularly vile master, _invisible_ stalkers form negative opinions of these creatures of flesh and bone, leading to their tendency to pervert their instructions and cause _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_ to their masters. For older and more experienced _invisible_ stalkers, the only thing protecting those who _[[universal monster rules/Summon|summon]]_ them is the magic that binds them. These creatures automatically try to use inconsistencies in the wording of their tasks and literal twists on the intention to find a way to inconvenience, injure, or even kill the priest or _[[classes/Arcanist|arcanist]]_ that brought them to the plane.
