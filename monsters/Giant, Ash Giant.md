  Disease (Su): |-
    While ash giants are immune to disease, they carry a contagious form of leprosy. Any creature struck by an ash giant's attacks is exposed to this virulent sickness.

    Ash Leprosy: Injury; save Fort 23; onset 1 minute; frequency 1 day; effect 1d2 Con damage, 1d2 Cha drain; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Oversized Weapon (Ex): An ash giant can wield Huge weapons without penalty.
  Vermin Empathy (Ex): This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy ability, save
    that it works only on vermin. An ash giant gains a racial bonus on this check
    equal to its Hit Dice (+14 for most ash giants). Vermin are normally mindless,
    but this empathic communication imparts upon them a modicum of implanted intelligence,
    allowing the ash giant to train vermin and use them as guardians (although it
    does not grant them skills or feats).
desc_long: |-
  Whether because of disruptive magic, unearthed deep elements, or alien technology that fell calamitously from the sky, ash giants are victims of their barren terrains. Yet they somehow survive and even thrive in these desperate lands. Ash giants have an uncanny ability to bond with the enormous and often mutated vermin they share the landscape with, and sometimes use the largest of these creatures as mounts.

  Ash giants are brash and violent, and their humor is incredibly dark. Killing someone through a prank is just as funny as tripping a friend while on a hunt. While not inherently evil, lifetimes of being antagonized by other tribes have practically bred violence into their minds.

  Ash giants are 10 feet tall and weigh 1,200 pounds.

##### Description

Whether because of _[[feats/Disruptive|disruptive]]_ magic, unearthed deep elements, or alien technology that fell calamitously from the sky, ash giants are victims of their barren terrains. Yet they somehow survive and even thrive in these desperate lands. Ash giants have an uncanny ability to bond with the enormous and often mutated vermin they share the landscape with, and sometimes use the largest of these creatures as mounts.

Ash giants are brash and violent, and their humor is incredibly dark. Killing someone through a prank is just as funny as tripping a friend while on a hunt. While not inherently evil, lifetimes of being antagonized by other tribes have practically bred violence into their minds.

Ash giants are 10 feet tall and weigh 1,200 pounds.
