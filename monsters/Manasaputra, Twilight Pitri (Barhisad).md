  Anatomical Undoing (Ex): A twilight pitri adds its Wisdommodifier instead of its
    Strength modifier to damage dealt byits unarmed attacks, as it has an intuitive
    grasp of how tounmake corporeal forms. On a critical hit with its unarmedstrike,
    it deals triple damage.
  Cerulean Nimbus (Su): Twilight pitris are surrounded by an eerieblue light said
    to be a reflection from a previous version ofthe multiverse. While active, this
    light grants them a +4 shieldbonus to their AC. A twilight pitri can make use
    of its frightfulpresence aura only while its cerulean nimbus surrounds it. Thepitri
    can dismiss the light as a free action, even when it is notthe pitri's turn, to
    reroll any one saving throw or to negate acritical hit. A dismissed nimbus returns
    in 1d3 rounds.
  Lunar Rays (Su): A twilight pitri can shoot rays of moonlightwith a range of 100
    feet. A twilight pitri can fire a singleray as an attack action, or up to four
    rays as a full attackaction. Firing a ray does not provoke attacks of opportunity.A
    twilight pitri can apply its Vital Strike feats to lunar rays.Each ray deals 8d6
    points of cold damage and 8d6 points ofpositive energy damage. This positive energy
    does not harmcreatures that aren't normally damaged by positive energy,nor does
    it heal them.
  Third Eye (Su): As a swift action, a twilight pitri can openor close its third eye.
    While the eye is open, the twilightpitri gains access to an additional pool of
    45 PE and gainsa constant true seeing effect, but loses the benefits of itscerulean
    nimbus. This pool of psychic energy is separatefrom the twilight pitri's regular
    pool, and is accessible onlywhile the third eye is open. Effects that blind a
    twilight pitriprevent the use of this ability.

  While clerics and oracles spin their own myths of creation,manasaputras tout an occult truth behind these stories-the current multiverse is not the first to exist and itwon't be the last. Like the cycle of seasons and the moon,existence itself waxes and wanes.

  Similar to the highest caste of pitris, twilight pitrisare manasaputras whose existence predates the currentmultiverse. Unlike the solar pitris, these creatures startedtheir path to enlightenment in the preceding multiverse,not some more ancient one. During that indescribableexistence, twilight pitris were mortals who ascended to theranks of manus. Surviving the natural end of their nativereality, they endured and were incarnated into the currentmultiverse as this higher caste of manasaputras. Thoughthey are in a higher form, it is one filled with tribulationand challenge, as becoming a twilight pitri is among thegreatest trials in the path to absolute enlightenment.

  This transition between multiverses has the effect ofcutting off the former manus' souls from the Cosmic Fireof creation. This “twilight” forces the new pitris to pursueenlightenment without the fire's guidance.

  While these creatures can hover around the Cosmic Fireon the Positive Energy Plane, they are barred from enteringit. Some occult scholars believe this is merely a taboo,but the prohibition is more than a metaphysical barrier.These pitris are incapable of the spiritual incorporealityfound among other types of manasaputras, which enablescommunion with the flame.

  While some occult scholars teach that this exile is someform of punishment for actions in past incarnations,both twilight and even solar pitris deny this explanation.Instead, exile from the cosmic source is a test in spiritualsuffering and self-sufficiency. Without the benefit of theCosmic Fire, each twilight pitri must look within itselfor to others to achieve full enlightenment, which is bothchallenging and spiritually taxing. Failure of this testleads to either the destruction of a twilight pitri or itscontinuance within lesser incarnations until the death ofthis multiverse and the creation of the next. Those who gaintrue enlightenment from this test become solar pitris whenthe next multiverse ignites, though most achieve statusas a twilight pitri, fail the test, and are reincarnatedas lesser manasaputras many times beforesucceeding and becoming solar pitris.

  Because these pitris are disconnectedfrom the cosmic source, their wisdomcan sometimes seem imperfect, at leastcompared to that of the solar pitris.While all twilight pitris seek to expandenlightenment in the multiverse,their actions can accidently workagainst enlightened truth.

  During the earliest epochs of thismultiverse, the first twilight pitrissought not only to shepherd thef ledgling races, but also to impartknowledge and reason to those withwhom they formed the closestbonds. The results of this effort stillhaunt them, as the pitris' imperfectmastery of cosmic enlightenmentturned these races into beingsdriven only by reason, logic,and systematic philosophies.As these beliefs opposed thespiritual ascension touted by othermanasaputras, these early racesascended to become other types ofoutsiders, swelling the ranks of suchbeings. In the end, the kumaras had tointercede and right the wrongs inadvertentlyspurred by the twilight pitris' actions. Becauseof this, many twilight pitris have chosen to bemore contemplative and intuitive in deciding ontheir courses of action than other manasaputras,while others become more active hoping to makeup for this early misstep.

  In spite of their alien origins, twilight pitris seek toaid and inspire mortals of the Material Plane. They takegreat care to search for and study the individual mortals,societies, and worlds that hold the greatest promise.Mortals who show the best chance of becoming someform of manu in their next incarnations are chosen andtaught the methods of contemplation, mindfully executedaction, and focused meditation necessary to achieve theirnext stage of enlightenment. At the same time, suchvisitations-either to mortals or others of their kind-can be both a boon and a curse, for the twilight pitrisoften act in unexpected ways-their minds inscrutableto the denizens of the Material Plane-and their lack ofconnection with the Cosmic Fire often makes them seemdisconnected from other manasaputras. A handful ofkumaras seek out the aid of twilight pitris when they doleave the Positive Energy Plane, enjoying and findingwisdom in their sometimes alien and unexpectedmodes of thought.

  Relationships between twilight pitris andmanus are complicated. Many manus haveat least one twilight pitri to thank fortheir first steps of enlightenment andacceptance into the manasaputra castes,but upon ascension, the new manusintuit how disconnected their formerteachers are from the cosmic source ofall things. They immediately find thewords and guidance of the twilightpitris to be filled with half-truthsand blind paths, even though thetwilight pitri's intentions are trueand honorable. These manus stillgive members of this caste therespect and reverence they deserve,and understand the importanceof this test-especially since theymay face it themselves one day-but often go to great pains to avoidasking a twilight pitri for counsel.Relationships between twilightpitris and samsarans are evenmore strained, as knowledgeablemembers of that race blame thetwilight pitris for nearly damning theentire samsaran race to a path outside ofreincarnation and enlightenment. Whilethey would never outwardly disrespectthese higher forms of being, they are oftensuspicious of the twilight pitris' guidanceand disregard twilight pitris' advice. Somesamsarans outright refuse all aid coming fromone of these manasaputras.

### Special Abilities

**Anatomical Undoing (Ex)** A twilight pitri adds its Wisdom

modifier instead of its Strength modifier to damage dealt by

its unarmed attacks, as it has an intuitive _[[spells/Grasp|grasp]]_ of how to

unmake corporeal forms. On a critical hit with its unarmed

strike, it deals triple damage.

**Cerulean Nimbus (Su)** Twilight pitris are surrounded by an eerie

blue light said to be a reflection from a previous version of

the multiverse. While active, this light grants them a +4 _shield_

bonus to their AC. A twilight pitri can make use of its frightful

presence aura only while its cerulean nimbus surrounds it. The

pitri can dismiss the light as a free action, even when it is not

the pitri’s turn, to reroll any one saving throw or to negate a

critical hit. A dismissed nimbus returns in 1d3 rounds.

**Lunar Rays (Su)** A twilight pitri can shoot rays of moonlight

with a range of 100 feet. A twilight pitri can fire a single

ray as an attack action, or up to four rays as a full attack

action. Firing a ray does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

A twilight pitri can apply its _Vital Strike_ feats to lunar rays.

Each ray deals 8d6 points of cold damage and 8d6 points of

positive energy damage. This positive energy does not _[[spells/Harm|harm]]_

creatures that aren’t normally damaged by positive energy,

nor does it _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ them.

**_Third Eye_ (Su)** As a swift action, a twilight pitri can open

or close its _third eye_. While the eye is open, the twilight

pitri gains access to an additional pool of 45 PE and gains

a constant _[[spells/True Seeing|true seeing]]_ effect, but loses the benefits of its

cerulean nimbus. This pool of _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ energy is separate

from the twilight pitri’s regular pool, and is accessible only

while the _third eye_ is open. Effects that blind a twilight pitri

prevent the use of this ability.

##### Description

While clerics and oracles spin their own myths of creation,

manasaputras tout an occult truth behind these stories—

the current multiverse is not the first to exist and it

won’t be the last. Like the cycle of seasons and the moon,

existence itself waxes and wanes.

Similar to the highest caste of pitris, twilight pitris

are manasaputras whose existence predates the current

multiverse. Unlike the solar pitris, these creatures started

their path to enlightenment in the preceding multiverse,

not some more ancient one. During that indescribable

existence, twilight pitris were mortals who ascended to the

ranks of manus. Surviving the natural end of their native

reality, they endured and were incarnated into the current

multiverse as this higher caste of manasaputras. Though

they are in a higher form, it is one filled with tribulation

and challenge, as becoming a twilight pitri is among the

greatest trials in the path to absolute enlightenment.

This transition between multiverses has the effect of

cutting off the former manus’ souls from the Cosmic Fire

of creation. This “twilight” forces the new pitris to pursue

enlightenment without the fire’s _[[spells/Guidance|guidance]]_.

While these creatures can _[[feats/Hover|hover]]_ around the Cosmic Fire

on the Positive Energy Plane, they are barred from entering

it. Some occult scholars believe this is merely a taboo,

but the prohibition is more than a metaphysical barrier.

These pitris are incapable of the spiritual incorporeality

found among other types of manasaputras, which enables

communion with the flame.

While some occult scholars teach that this exile is some

form of punishment for actions in past incarnations,

both twilight and even solar pitris deny this explanation.

Instead, exile from the cosmic source is a test in spiritual

suffering and self-sufficiency. Without the benefit of the

Cosmic Fire, each twilight pitri must look within itself

or to others to achieve full enlightenment, which is both

challenging and spiritually taxing. Failure of this test

leads to either the _[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ of a twilight pitri or its

continuance within lesser incarnations until the death of

this multiverse and the creation of the next. Those who gain

true enlightenment from this test become solar pitris when

the next multiverse ignites, though most achieve _[[spells/Status|status]]_

as a twilight pitri, fail the test, and are reincarnated

as lesser manasaputras many times before

succeeding and becoming solar pitris.

Because these pitris are disconnected

from the cosmic source, their wisdom

can sometimes seem imperfect, at least

compared to that of the solar pitris.

While all twilight pitris seek to expand

enlightenment in the multiverse,

their actions can accidently work

against enlightened truth.

During the earliest epochs of this

multiverse, the first twilight pitris

sought not only to shepherd the

f ledgling races, but also to impart

knowledge and reason to those with

whom they formed the closest

bonds. The results of this effort still

haunt them, as the pitris’ imperfect

mastery of cosmic enlightenment

turned these races into beings

driven only by reason, logic,

and systematic philosophies.

As these beliefs opposed the

spiritual _[[spells/Ascension|ascension]]_ touted by other

manasaputras, these early races

ascended to become other types of

outsiders, swelling the ranks of such

beings. In the end, the kumaras had to

intercede and right the wrongs inadvertently

spurred by the twilight pitris’ actions. Because

of this, many twilight pitris have chosen to be

more _[[monsters/Contemplative|contemplative]]_ and intuitive in deciding on

their courses of action than other manasaputras,

while others become more active hoping to make

up for this early misstep.

In _[[spells/Spite|spite]]_ of their alien origins, twilight pitris seek to

aid and inspire mortals of the Material Plane. They take

great care to search for and study the individual mortals,

societies, and worlds that hold the greatest promise.

Mortals who show the best chance of becoming some

form of manu in their next incarnations are chosen and

taught the methods of contemplation, mindfully executed

action, and focused meditation necessary to achieve their

next stage of enlightenment. At the same time, such

visitations—either to mortals or others of their kind—

can be both a boon and a curse, for the twilight pitris

often act in unexpected ways—their minds inscrutable

to the denizens of the Material Plane—and their lack of

connection with the Cosmic Fire often makes them seem

disconnected from other manasaputras. A handful of

kumaras seek out the aid of twilight pitris when they do

leave the Positive Energy Plane, enjoying and finding

wisdom in their sometimes alien and unexpected

modes of thought.

Relationships between twilight pitris and

manus are complicated. Many manus have

at least one twilight pitri to thank for

their first steps of enlightenment and

acceptance into the manasaputra castes,

but upon _ascension_, the new manus

intuit how disconnected their former

teachers are from the cosmic source of

all things. They immediately find the

words and _guidance_ of the twilight

pitris to be filled with half-truths

and blind paths, even though the

twilight pitri’s intentions are true

and honorable. These manus still

give members of this caste the

respect and reverence they deserve,

and understand the importance

of this test—especially since they

may face it themselves one day—

but often go to great pains to avoid

asking a twilight pitri for counsel.

Relationships between twilight

pitris and samsarans are even

more strained, as knowledgeable

members of that race blame the

twilight pitris for nearly damning the

entire _[[monsters/Samsaran|samsaran]]_ race to a path outside of

reincarnation and enlightenment. While

they would never outwardly disrespect

these higher forms of being, they are often

suspicious of the twilight pitris’ _guidance_

and disregard twilight pitris’ advice. Some

samsarans outright refuse all aid coming from

one of these manasaputras.
