  Distracting Cacophony (Su): Although a syncytium is not intelligent enough to understand
    language, its halfformed mouths constantly emit a distracting cacophony of sounds
    and nonsense words. A syncytium can activate this ability is a free action. All
    other creatures in a 30-foot radius must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or be staggered
    for 1 round. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by this proto-shoggoth's
    distracting cacophony again for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect.
    The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Merge (Ex): |-
    As a full-round action, two proto-shoggoth syncytia can attempt to merge (see the Merge entry in the proto-shoggoth stat block on page 90); each must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save in order to merge. If both succeed at this save, they combine to form a fully-grown shoggoth (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 249).

    Early attempts by the elder things (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 85) to craft life resulted in strange, heaving masses of protoplasm that displayed a disturbing hunger for living flesh. Emboldened by this discovery, the alien scientists soon stabilized this matter, resulting in the creation of the first proto-shoggoths.

    A proto-shoggoth appears as a tangled mass of roiling flesh and organs weighing approximately 160 pounds, and is capable of forming all manner of hideous and nauseating shapes.

The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Merge (Ex)** As a full-round action, two _proto-shoggoth_ syncytia can attempt to merge (see the Merge entry in the _proto-shoggoth_ stat block on page 90); each must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save in order to merge. If both succeed at this save, they combine to form a fully-grown _[[monsters/Shoggoth|shoggoth]]_ (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 249).
