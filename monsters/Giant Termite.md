##### Description

Giant termites are social, burrowing

insects that create immense earthen

mounds the size of cathedrals to house

their large colonies. The colony splits

into small groups to take on various

tasks, like hunting food or collecting

dirt and _[[items/Mundane/Clay|clay]]_ to expand the colony’s

mound. They are destructive pests,

consuming plant matter and destroying

wooden structures, but they consume

meat as well if creatures interfere

with their cycle of demolition

and construction. Termites also

use their acid to render animals

into glue to reinforce the mound.
