  Engulf (Ex): If a giant flytrap begins its turn with an opponent at least two size
    categories smaller than itself grappled in one of its mouths, it can close its
    jaws completely around the foe by making a new combat maneuver check (as though
    attempting to pin the foe). If it succeeds, it engulfs the prey and inflicts 1d8+7
    points of damage and 2d6 acid damage as the cavity floods with digestive enzymes.
    The seal formed is airtight, so an engulfed creature risks suffocation. Engulf
    is a special form of pinning, and an engulfed creature can escape in the same
    way as he can from being pinned, but since an engulfed creature is contained wholly
    inside the plant's jaws, the flytrap's victim cannot be targeted by effects or
    attacks that require line of sight or line of effect. A giant flytrap that is
    grappling or pinning a foe cannot attack other targets with that bite, but is
    not otherwise hindered.
desc_long: |-
  A hardy plant that grows in areas with poor soil but abundant animal life, this dangerous predator is an immense version of its more common (and much smaller) kin. Whereas the smaller flytraps supplement their growth by catching insects, the giant flytrap does the same with animals, humanoids, and anything else foolish enough to draw too near. Local legends call this plant names like “mancatcher,” “snapperjaw plant,” “dragonleaf plant,” “cowbiter,” and “green gulper,” but adventurers know it simply as the giant flytrap.

  As the giant flytrap's prey are generally much smarter than insects, this huge plant has evolved into a much more aggressive hunter than its smaller brethren. It can lumber slowly along the ground, using its writhing roots like tentacles to relocate to more populous hunting grounds, and is quite canny at blending in with the surrounding foliage. A giant flytrap's jaws and stalks are swift-moving-it reaches out and snaps at passersby with lightning speed. The plant itself even has a modicum of intelligence, and is capable of limited tactical choices, such as knowing when to break off an attack against a powerful foe.

  While most giant flytraps have four sets of jaws, some can have as few as one, and others eight or more. As a general rule, you should increase a giant flytrap's HD by 2 and its natural armor bonus by +1 for each additional bite attack you give it, increasing its CR by +1 for each time you increase its attacks and HD in this manner. If you increase the plant by more than 3 or 4 bites (and thus by more than 6 or 8 Hit Dice), consult Table: Monster Statistics by CR to make sure that the plant's CR remains appropriate.

  A giant flytrap's stalks are 20 feet long, but generally sprawl relatively close to the central mass-a set of full-grown flytrap jaws is 7 feet across. A giant flytrap weighs 9,000 pounds.

##### Description

A hardy plant that grows in areas with poor soil but abundant animal life, this dangerous predator is an immense version of its more common (and much smaller) kin. Whereas the smaller flytraps supplement their growth by catching insects, the _giant flytrap_ does the same with animals, humanoids, and anything else foolish enough to draw too near. Local legends call this plant names like “_[[items/Weapon/Mancatcher|mancatcher]]_,” “snapperjaw plant,” “dragonleaf plant,” “cowbiter,” and “green gulper,” but adventurers know it simply as the _giant flytrap_.

As the _giant flytrap_’s prey are generally much smarter than insects, this huge plant has evolved into a much more aggressive _[[classes/Hunter|hunter]]_ than its smaller brethren. It can lumber slowly along the ground, using its writhing roots like tentacles to relocate to more populous hunting grounds, and is quite canny at blending in with the surrounding foliage. A _giant flytrap_’s jaws and stalks are swift-moving—it reaches out and snaps at passersby with lightning speed. The plant itself even has a modicum of intelligence, and is capable of limited tactical choices, such as knowing when to break off an attack against a powerful foe.

While most giant flytraps have four sets of jaws, some can have as few as one, and others eight or more. As a general rule, you should increase a _giant flytrap_’s HD by 2 and its natural armor bonus by +1 for each additional bite attack you give it, increasing its CR by +1 for each time you increase its attacks and HD in this manner. If you increase the plant by more than 3 or 4 bites (and thus by more than 6 or 8 Hit Dice), consult Table: Monster Statistics by CR to make sure that the plant’s CR remains appropriate.

A _giant flytrap_’s stalks are 20 feet long, but generally sprawl relatively close to the central mass—a set of full-grown flytrap jaws is 7 feet across. A _giant flytrap_ weighs 9,000 pounds.
