### Special Abilities

**Abandon Flesh (Su)** As a swift action, a vermlek can abandon an inhabited body, crawling hideously out of its host and leaving behind an empty _[[items/Mundane/Sack|sack]]_ of skin and bits of gristle. In so doing, it absorbs much of the body’s flesh to _[[spells/Heal|heal]]_ itself, regaining 2d6+3 hit points. A vermlek cannot later reclaim this body with its inhabit body ability.

**Flesh Armor (Su)** When a vermlek inhabits a humanoid body (see Inhabit Body below), it treats the dead flesh and muscle as armor, gaining a +3 armor bonus to its AC.

**Inhabit Body (Su)** A vermlek can crawl into the body of any dead _Medium_ humanoid, consuming and replacing the bulk of the humanoid’s skeleton and internal organs as it does so. This process takes 1d4 rounds, during which the vermlek is _flat-footed_. Once the process is complete, the vermlek appears for all practical purposes to be a living but hideously obese version of the previous humanoid—it gains a +8 racial bonus on Disguise checks to appear as a normal humanoid while wearing a dead body in this manner, but does not gain any of the abilities that the dead creature had in life, including _[[universal monster rules/Natural Attacks|natural attacks]]_, unusual movement types, or natural armor. It loses its own _burrow_ speed while inhabiting a body but gains the ability to wield weapons or wear armor shaped for humanoids (although the armor bonus granted by wearing armor does not stack with the bonus granted by the vermlek’s flesh armor ability).

##### Description

Vermleks form from the souls of those who habitually violated the dead in life, such as grave robbers, necromancers, and necrophiles. Demonic armies often use them as disposable troops in war, with vermleks inhabiting the bodies of slain humanoid enemies to infiltrate and destroy any surviving humanoids from within their own society. When inhabiting bodies, vermleks tend to mutter and mumble rather than speaking clearly, as _[[spells/They Know|they know]]_ that a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Keen|keen]]_ eye that peers into the body’s mouth can swiftly discern the horrible truth within.

Despite the fact that they are often used as battleground troops, vermleks have little taste for war and, left alone, prefer to live in hiding among humanoids on the Material Plane. There, disguised as laborers like gravediggers or dung sweepers, they can revel in their ghoulish, taboo lusts.

Outside of a host body, a vermlek appears as a worm with four long tails, each of which ends in a tangle of filaments. In this form, the demon is 7 feet long and weighs 90 pounds.
