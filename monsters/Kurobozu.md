### Special Abilities

**Disease (Su)** Black apoxia:

_Steal breath_—

inhaled;

save Fort DC 18; onset

1 day; frequency 1/day;

effect 1d3 Con damage

and _[[conditions/Exhausted|exhausted]]_; cure 2

consecutive saves.

**_Echo_ of Life (Su)** A

_[[monsters/Kurobozu|kurobozu]]_ retains some

the same disciplined

_[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ it had in life.

It gains the _monk_’s

evasion, AC bonus,

_stunning fist_, and flurry

of blows class features

and unarmed strike damage

as a _monk_ of equal level to its

Hit Dice. A _kurobozu_’s stunning

fist lasts 1 round longer than normal. In addition, a _kurobozu_

replaces its Constitution modifier with its Wisdom modifier

instead of its Charisma modifier.
**Sage’s _Bane_ (Su)** Any target struck by a _kurobozu_’s unarmed

strike takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage and loses an

equal amount of ki (Fortitude DC 18 negates both). For every

point of Wisdom damage a _kurobozu_ deals, it heals 5 hit

points. Hit points received in excess of the creature’s normal

total are treated as temporary hit points and dissipate after

1 minute. The save DC is Wisdom-based.
**_Steal Breath_ (Su)** As a standard action, a _kurobozu_ can steal

the breath from a _[[conditions/Stunned|stunned]]_ or _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ target, as per the

spell _[[spells/Suffocation|suffocation]]_, except it never causes the victim to die.

Regardless of whether it successfully saved, the victim can’t

speak for 1 minute, and its breath reeks of carrion. This also

exposes the victim to the _kurobozu_’s disease.

##### Description

Kurobozus, also _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ black monks, are jealous undead

that arise when a _monk_ dies under circumstances that

violate the precepts of his or her monastic _training_.

Kurobozus need to feed upon the breath of mortals to

survive, and they usually acquire this sustenance by

sneaking up on a sleeping victim, though they can just

as easily draw breath from a foe _stunned_ by their f ists in

combat. While this feeding doesn’t immediately kill the

victim, it leaves a horrif ic rotting _[[universal monster rules/Scent|scent]]_ on the victim’s

breath that can spread the _kurobozu_’s contagious apoxia

to others, eventually leading to faintness, exhaustion,

and death.

When they aren’t maintaining their existence through

feeding, kurobozus carry out their jealous fantasies by

murdering living monks, especially members of their

former monastery or monastic tradition. They still possess

a shred of their former discipline, which

they use to formulate long-term plans

for their acts of revenge. Generally,

kurobozus’ interactions with

other creatures are limited

to feeding and killing, but

they have an affinity for

malcontent ex-monks and

may actually go out of

their way to secretly offer

protection or succor to

such a person, without

ever revealing their true

identities. Evil ex-monks

seeking to destroy their

former masters and

fellow disciples may

even see the actual face of

their benefactors and be able to

forge lasting alliances.
