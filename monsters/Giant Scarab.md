doubled against creatures with no armor or natural armor,

but creatures in heavy armor or with a natural armor bonus

those immune to critical hits.

##### Description

Scarabs are small, six-legged insects with sharp protrusions

on their front legs that they use for burrowing. They are

primarily coprophagous, eating dung for sustenance. An

individual scarab often spends days rolling a single ball

of dung across the desert until it can find the perfect

place to bury it and deposit eggs. Because they _[[universal monster rules/Burrow|burrow]]_

underground to create life, scarab beetles are associated

with burial rites. Some say scarab beetles’ connection with

the dead gives them powers greater than those of normal

beetles, but as of yet there is no evidence this is true.
