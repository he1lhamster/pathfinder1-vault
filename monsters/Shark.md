**_[[monsters/Tiger|Tiger]]_ _Shark_ (CR 3)**: Larger than the average _shark_, the _[[curses/Ravenous|ravenous]]_ _tiger_ _shark_ is a giant _shark_.

**Great White _Shark_ (CR 4)**: One of the most notorious maneaters of the sea, the truly immense great white _shark_ is an advanced giant _shark_.
