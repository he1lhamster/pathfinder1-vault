special_abilities:
  Blood Healing (Ex): Whenever a star vampire starts its turn within 10 feet of a
    creature suffering a bleed effect (other than itself or another star vampire),
    it heals 5 points of damage as minuscule tendrils slither out from its body to
    leech away the dripping blood with disgusting efficiency.
  Flight (Su): A star vampire's ability to fly is supernatural and doesn't function
    in areas where magic doesn't work. Furthermore, when engorged with blood and thus
    visible, it takes a -10 penalty on Fly checks.
  Loathsome Embrace (Ex): The slithering wet tentacles and suckered tendrils a star
    vampire uses to feed with and clutch its prey are particularly disgusting to experience.
    Any creature that is grappled by or that grapples a star vampire must attempt
    a DC 16 Will save to avoid being nauseated for 1 round. A new Will save is required
    each round the grapple is maintained, but once a creature succeeds at its saving
    throw against a star vampire's loathsome embrace, it becomes immune to the loathsome
    embrace of all star vampires for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
    The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Partial Invisibility (Su): A star vampire is invisible in its natural state, although
    the eerie tittering it constantly emits makes locating it easier than normal-treat
    a star vampire as if it were in combat or speaking for the purposes of Perception
    checks against it. When a star vampire feeds on blood (either as a result of a
    successful blood drain attack or by gaining the benefit of its blood healing),
    it becomes visible, its nauseating appearance laid bare by the blood that infuses
    its entire being. A star vampire that becomes visible in this manner remains visible
    until it takes 2 consecutive rounds of bleed damage or 10 minutes pass after it
    last drained blood or gained the benefit of blood healing.
  Scent Blood (Ex): A star vampire has the scent ability against all living creatures
    that have blood, and it gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Perception checks against
    creatures currently taking bleed damage.
  Weakness to Bleed Effects (Ex): When subjected to a bleed effect, a star vampire
    suffers wracking pain that leaves it sickened as long as the bleed effect persists.
    Consumed blood drains rapidly from a star vampire's body when it is affected by
    a bleed effect, and after 2 consecutive rounds of bleed damage, a star vampire
    that had become visible after drinking blood becomes invisible once again.
desc_long: |-
  Star vampires descend upon worlds to feed upon the blood of the living. Naturally invisible, star vampires expose their offensive shapes when they feed, for the blood they gorge upon infuses their bodies with a glistening crimson hue. Tangled masses of writhing feelers surrounding toothy maws, star vampires can extend three long tentacles tipped with talons to lacerate foes, allowing the aberrations to drink the blood from the air with thousands of tiny feeding tendrils.

  A star vampire is approximately 10 feet in diameter, yet weighs a mere 300 pounds.
