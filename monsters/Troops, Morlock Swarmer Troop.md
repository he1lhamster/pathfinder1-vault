  Expert Climber (Ex): A morlock swarmer troop can cling to cave walls and even ceilings
    as long as the surface has hand- and footholds. In effect, the troop is treated
    as constantly being under a nonmagical version of the spell spider climb, save
    that it cannot cling to smooth surfaces. This ability doubles the +8 racial bonus
    on Climb checks normally afforded creatures that have a climb speed.
  Leap Attack (Ex): As a standard action, a morlock swarmer troop that succeeds at
    an Acrobatics check can move as per the results of that check, making either a
    long jump or a high jump as normal. The troop must move horizontally in a straight
    line during its jump. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. When
    using this ability, the morlock swarmer troop can deal troop damage to any creature
    it is adjacent to over the course of the jump. This does not allow the morlock
    swarmer troop to deal troop damage to a creature more than once per round.
  Swarming (Ex): Much of the morlock swarmer troop's damage comes from sneak attacks
    made by its constituent members as they climb over one another, confusing their
    prey. Against creatures that cannot be flanked or that are immune to critical
    hits, sneak attacks, or precision-based damage, the morlock swarmer troop's attack
    damage is reduced to 2d6.
desc_long: While all morlocks are adept at fighting as a group and swarming against
  enemies, Kosseruk's training has whipped these morlocks into a cohesive troop, making
  them particularly deadly. It is unlikely the morlock troops would function were
  it not for Zanathura's influence.

### Special Abilities

**Expert Climber (Ex)** A _[[monsters/Morlock|morlock]]_ swarmer troop can cling to cave walls and even ceilings as long as the surface has hand- and footholds. In effect, the troop is treated as constantly being under a nonmagical version of the spell _[[spells/Spider Climb|spider climb]]_, save that it cannot cling to smooth surfaces. This ability doubles the +8 racial bonus on _Climb_ checks normally afforded creatures that have a _climb_ speed.

**Leap Attack (Ex)** As a standard action, a _morlock_ swarmer troop that succeeds at an Acrobatics check can move as per the results of that check, making either a long _[[spells/Jump|jump]]_ or a high _jump_ as normal. The troop must move horizontally in a straight line during its _jump_. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. When using this ability, the _morlock_ swarmer troop can deal troop damage to any creature it is adjacent to over the course of the _jump_. This does not allow the _morlock_ swarmer troop to deal troop damage to a creature more than once per round.
**Swarming (Ex)** Much of the _morlock_ swarmer troop’s damage comes from sneak attacks made by its constituent members as they _climb_ over one another, confusing their prey. Against creatures that cannot be flanked or that are immune to critical hits, sneak attacks, or precision-based damage, the _morlock_ swarmer troop’s attack damage is reduced to 2d6.

##### Description

While all morlocks are adept at fighting as a group and swarming against enemies, Kosseruk’s _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Training|training]]_ has whipped these morlocks into a cohesive troop, making them particularly _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_. It is unlikely the _morlock_ troops would function were it not for Zanathura’s influence.
