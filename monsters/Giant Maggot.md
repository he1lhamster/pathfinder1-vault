  Regurgitate (Ex): Once per day, a giant maggot can empty its putrid stomach upon

    sickened for 1 minute (or until the target spends a full-round action with at
    least a gallon of water to wash off the filth). The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: Voracious scavengers, giant maggots feed constantly, gorging themselves
  on the dead in preparation for their transformation into giant flies. Their pallid,
  corpulent bodies are the size of human children, and their rasping teeth are capable
  of eating even the bones of a corpse. Giant maggots have no legs, and move with
  a disturbing undulation as they crawl over their meals. Giant maggots feed for 2
  weeks (often moving from one corpse to another) before entering a pupal stage, after
  which they emerge as giant flies.
