##### Description

More so than its smaller kin, the human-sized giant _porcupine_ is a foul-tempered creature that is just as content chewing on carrion as on living creatures. Worse, giant porcupines are notorious in their almost foolhardy bravery, and have been known to attack creatures much larger than their own size. This unexpected aggression, when combined with their tangle of spearlike quills, makes the giant _porcupine_ a dangerous foe.
