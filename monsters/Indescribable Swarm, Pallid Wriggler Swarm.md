  From the deepest regions of the Darklands come the strange creatures commonly called pallid wrigglers. Originally bats mutated by mad derros to enhance their natural abilities, the wrigglers have slowly evolved to their current form. A wriggler's wormlike body is supported between anywhere from two and six wings, four to eight legs, and possibly a collection of tails. Each creature lacks a head, and instead has merely a pair of grotesque nostrils, which create the trademark sound that both aids it in hunting and overwhelms its prey's senses.

  These creatures aren't terribly dangerous individually, but meet any disturbances in their territory with swift and often deadly investigation. The creatures immediately swarm any intruders, trying to learn their scent from as close as possible. They seem driven more by curiosity than animosity, but the resultant battering and probing can occasionally prove fatal. Pallid wrigglers are herbivores, feeding on the fungus that is ubiquitous in their cavernous lairs, so creatures slain by their attentions often rot away unless eaten by another scavenger.

### Special Abilities

**Indescribable Swarm (Ex)** The horror of discovering a swarm that seems normal at first holds a bloodcurdling secret can drive sane folk mad. The first time an intelligent creature encounters a given variety of swarm with this ability, it must succeed at a Will saving throw against the swarm’s _distraction_ ability save DC or become _[[conditions/Shaken|shaken]]_ for 1 hour or until the swarm is defeated, whichever comes first.
**Snort (Ex)** The swarm’s strange noises increase the DC of its _distraction_ ability by 2. Additionally, if the swarm spends a full-round action sniffing and searching for targets, the range of its _blindsense_ increases to 60 feet until the end of its next round.

##### Description

From the deepest regions of the Darklands come the strange creatures commonly _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ pallid wrigglers. Originally bats mutated by mad derros to enhance their natural abilities, the wrigglers have slowly evolved to their current form. A wriggler’s wormlike body is supported between anywhere from two and six wings, four to eight legs, and possibly a collection of tails. Each creature lacks a head, and instead has merely a pair of grotesque nostrils, which create the trademark sound that both aids it in hunting and overwhelms its prey’s senses.

These creatures aren’t terribly dangerous individually, but meet any disturbances in their territory with swift and often _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ investigation. The creatures immediately swarm any intruders, trying to learn their _scent_ from as close as possible. They seem driven more by curiosity than animosity, but the resultant battering and probing can occasionally prove fatal. Pallid wrigglers are herbivores, feeding on the fungus that is ubiquitous in their cavernous lairs, so creatures slain by their attentions often rot away unless eaten by another scavenger.
