  Hallucinatory Spores (Ex): Once per day as a standard action, a hangman tree can
    release a cloud of spores in a 50-foot-radius spread. Creatures in the area must
    make a DC 20 Will save or believe the hangman tree to be a perfectly ordinary
    tree-or at worst, a treant or some other friendly tree-like creature. An affected
    creature becomes passive for 2d6 minutes and refuses to attack the hangman tree
    during this time. An affected creature can attempt a new Will save each round
    that the tree attacks an ally-if a hallucinating creature is attacked by the tree,
    it gains a +4 bonus on its Will save to see through the hallucination. This is
    a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Vines (Ex): A hangman tree's vines are primary attacks that deal bludgeoning damage.
    When a hangman tree grapples a foe with its vines, the tree does not gain the
    grappled condition. A hangman tree that uses swallow whole transfers a pinned
    creature from a vine to inside its trunk.

  The hangman tree prefers to lie in wait near remote forest tracks and game trails, waiting for victims to wander by. These carnivorous plants are incredibly patient, and can wait for months in a single location for food to approach. When prey does draw near, the tree's vines lash like striking snakes. The tree often uses its pull ability to hoist grappled foes 10 to 15 feet in the air so that they are out of reach of allies while they slowly strangle. The tree generally only swallows one foe whole at a time, letting its other captured victims dangle and ripen until it is ready to feed on them.

  A hangman tree is 30 feet tall and weighs 12,000 pounds.

### Special Abilities

**Hallucinatory Spores (Ex)** Once per day as a standard action, a _[[monsters/Hangman Tree|hangman tree]]_ can release a cloud of spores in a 50-foot-radius spread. Creatures in the area must make a DC 20 Will save or believe the _hangman tree_ to be a perfectly ordinary tree—or at worst, a _[[monsters/Treant|treant]]_ or some other friendly tree-like creature. An affected creature becomes passive for 2d6 minutes and refuses to attack the _hangman tree_ during this time. An affected creature can attempt a new Will save each round that the tree attacks an ally—if a hallucinating creature is attacked by the tree, it gains a +4 bonus on its Will save to see through the hallucination. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Vines (Ex)** A _hangman tree_’s vines are primary attacks that deal bludgeoning damage. When a _hangman tree_ grapples a foe with its vines, the tree does not gain the _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ condition. A _hangman tree_ that uses _swallow whole_ transfers a _[[conditions/Pinned|pinned]]_ creature from a vine to inside its trunk.

##### Description

The _hangman tree_ prefers to lie in wait near remote forest tracks and game trails, waiting for victims to wander by. These carnivorous plants are incredibly patient, and can wait for months in a single location for food to approach. When prey does draw near, the tree’s vines lash like striking snakes. The tree often uses its _pull_ ability to hoist _grappled_ foes 10 to 15 feet in the air so that they are out of reach of allies while they slowly _strangle_. The tree generally only swallows one foe whole at a time, letting its other captured victims dangle and ripen until it is ready to feed on them.

A _hangman tree_ is 30 feet tall and weighs 12,000 pounds.
