### Special Abilities

**_Ramming_ Snout (Ex)** When a kaprosuchus charges, it can ram

an opponent with the calcified tip of its snout. This attack

has the same attack bonus as the kaprosuchus’s bite attack,

and it deals an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to the

kaprosuchus’s bite damage. If the attack is successful, the

kaprosuchus can attempt

a _trip_ combat maneuver

against the target as a

free action.

##### Description

Despite its close

resemblance to other

types of crocodilians,

the kaprosuchus is a

terrestrial predator, not an

aquatic one. Squat and

powerfully built, these

creatures hunt for

prey in forests.

The adults can

grow up to 20

feet long and

weigh as much as

2,500 pounds.
