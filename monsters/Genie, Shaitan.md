  Earth Mastery (Ex): A shaitan gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls and a

    the ground. It takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls against airborne
    or waterborne opponents.
  Metalmorph (Su): As a standard action, a shaitan may touch a single metal object
    of no more than 10 pounds and transform it into any other metal for 1 day.
  Stone Curse (Su): If a shaitan wins a bull rush check by 5 or more and pushes its
    target into a stone barrier, the target must make a DC 19 Reflex save or be forced
    into the barrier as if the target had cast meld into stone until the victim makes
    a successful DC 19 Fortitude save as a full-round action to exit the stone. The
    save DCs are Strength-based.
  Stone Glide (Su): This functions as the earth elemental's earth glide ability, except
    the shaitan can move through stone, dirt, crystal, or metal.
desc_long: |-
  Shaitans are boastful and proud genies from the Plane of Earth with flesh of metal, gems, or stone. A shaitan stands about 11 feet tall and weighs roughly 5,000 pounds.

A noble shaitan's caster level for its spell-like abilities is 18th. Noble shaitans are CR 13.
