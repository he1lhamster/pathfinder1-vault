special_abilities:
  Bloody Rose (Su): At will as a free action, the herald can create a thorny red rose.
    She may use this rose as a +1 anarchic dart as if she had the Quick Draw feat.
    The rose loses all its powers 1 round after it leaves the herald's hand.
  Darkwood Breastplate: The herald's +4 darkwood breastplate has all the normal properties
    of darkwood but is as hard and strong as steel (similar to wood created with an
    ironwood spell).
  Favored Enemy (Ex): The herald has the favored enemy ability of a 17th-level ranger.
  Imbue with Power (Su): 'The herald can imbue an ally with a portion of her power.
    This ability functions like imbue with spell ability, except she may transfer
    uses of the following spell-like abilities as if they were cleric spells: cure
    moderate wounds, magic weapon, peasant armaments, protection from arrows, shield
    other, and status. Using this ability reduces the number of times per day she
    can use that spell-like ability until she dismisses the transfer or the recipient
    expends it (for example, if she imbues a target with cure moderate wounds, thereafter
    she can only use that spell-like ability twice per day).'
  Martyr's Blood (Su): By marking an ally with her blood, the herald can transfer
    part of her fast healing ability to that ally. The herald's fast healing decreases
    by 1 (minimum 0), and the ally gains fast healing 1 for 1 hour. This ability has
    no effect if the target already has fast healing.
  Rebellious Aura (Su): The herald's aura grants allies within 60 feet the effects
    of good hope and a paladin's aura of courage. The effects of this ability are
    included in the herald's stat block.
  Tactician (Ex): The herald has the tactician ability of a 17th-level cavalier (4/day,
    one teamwork feat, all allies within 30 feet, 11 rounds). She may use this ability
    with any of her teamwork feats (Lookout, Outflank, Swap Places).
desc_long: |-
  Courage Heart is a weapon against tyranny and a mighty spark that kindles the fires of hope in mortal hearts. Once a mortal ranger in the service of Milani, she was an early champion of Galt's Red Revolution when its purpose was to depose evil Chelish nobles, but when that movement become more about chaos and vengeance, she fought against it instead. Eventually branded a Chelish sympathizer by the Revolutionary Council, she allowed herself to be captured in order to allow her allies to escape. She was executed with a final blade, which trapped her soul within it.

  Milani, having spent a century communicating directly with her followers, saw the merits of having a divine champion like other deities, and plucked the woman's soul from the artifact and made her a herald. Now the martyred hero keeps her original name secret so her living relatives in Galt do not become targets by association, and calls herself Courage Heart. Her mission is twofold: to attack the powerful enemies of the church (especially immortal undead who would subjugate the common folk and conjured outsiders used to strike fear into mortal hearts), and to inspire hope among mortals so they can find the strength to turn against tyrants.

  As Courage Heart opposes slavery and unjust imprisonment, she has made it her personal crusade to steal all the final blades and free the souls within them. Milani must look at the bigger picture, so the herald has to make progress toward this goal when she can. Courage Heart has been trying to get Pharasma's herald, the Steward of the Skein, to join her cause, as preventing souls from reaching the Boneyard is of interest to the Lady of Graves, but that herald's strange nature and the recent creation of the final blades (relative to the history of civilization) means she has made little headway in establishing that alliance to date.

##### Description

_[[monsters/Courage Heart|Courage Heart]]_ is a weapon against tyranny and a mighty _[[spells/Spark|spark]]_ that kindles the fires of hope in mortal hearts. Once a mortal _ranger_ in the service of Milani, she was an early _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Champion|champion]]_ of Galt’s Red Revolution when its purpose was to depose evil Chelish nobles, but when that movement become more about chaos and _[[feats/Vengeance|vengeance]]_, she fought against it instead. Eventually branded a Chelish sympathizer by the Revolutionary Council, she allowed herself to be captured in order to allow her allies to escape. She was executed with a _[[items/Wondrous Item/Final Blade|final blade]]_, which trapped her soul within it.

Milani, having spent a century communicating directly with her followers, _[[items/Mundane/Saw|saw]]_ the merits of having a divine _champion_ like other deities, and plucked the woman’s soul from the artifact and made her a herald. Now the martyred hero keeps her original name secret so her living relatives in Galt do not become targets by association, and calls herself _Courage Heart_. Her mission is twofold: to attack the powerful enemies of the church (especially immortal undead who would subjugate the common folk and conjured outsiders used to strike _fear_ into mortal hearts), and to inspire hope among mortals so they can find the strength to turn against tyrants.
