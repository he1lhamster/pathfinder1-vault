special_abilities:
  Blind (Ex): A wamp lacks eyes and “sees” exclusively through its blindsight ability,
    which is based on a combination of sound, body heat, and the natural growth and
    decay of matter. It is considered blind beyond 60 feet. It is invulnerable to
    all sight-based attacks and effects, including gaze attacks.
  Disease (Ex): |-
    A wamp's bite attack infects those it damages with disease. For most wamps, this is a virulent form of zombie rot, but in some cases, a wamp can inflict foes with other undeath-related contagions, such as ghoul fever.

     Zombie Rot: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 19; onset 1 round; frequency 12 hours; effect 1d2 Con, this damage cannot be healed while the creature is infected; cure 2 consecutive saves. Any creature that dies while infected rises as a plague zombie in 2d6 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Feign Undeath (Ex): Although the wamp is a living creature, it registers as an undead
    creature for the purposes of the spell detect undead. As a swift action, a wamp
    can attempt to trick an undead creature into thinking the wamp is itself undead-to
    do so, it attempts a Disguise check opposed by the target undead creature's Perception
    check. A successful Disguise check allows the wamp to maintain the facade against
    that undead creature for 24 hours before being forced to make a new check. This
    ability lets the wamp move relatively unhindered among unintelligent undead, but
    intelligent undead who understand the threat a wamp presents are unlikely to be
    fooled by this deception for long. This ability does not allow the wamp to be
    healed by negative energy; it is harmed by such attacks (and healed by positive
    energy) as per normal for a living creature. It does grant the wamp a +4 bonus
    on all saving throws made against attacks and effects generated by undead creatures,
    regardless of whether its trickery has worked on that particular undead creature.
  Swift Infection (Su): All diseases a wamp inflicts on creatures have no onset time,
    and those who are infected with such a disease must attempt saving throws to avoid
    its effects twice as frequently as normal for that disease.
desc_long: |-
  Wamps dwell in the dead cities of the Dreamlands, particularly within necropolises or undead-haunted graveyards, where they can hunt their favored prey-unliving creatures with decaying flesh-with ease. A wamp is a vaguely arachnid creature, albeit one with nine legs that end in webbed feet colored a brilliant red, as if the creature had just finished wading through a pool of fresh gore. The wamp's face combines the least attractive features of a pig and a bat, but without the eyes. Covered with bristly pale fur save for their crimson feet, wamps often invite comparison to blood-smeared bones due to their coloration. Wamps often chuckle and chortle as they draw near their prey, eschewing ambush tactics in favor of a more disturbing opening volley of mockery designed to let their victims know that they have been marked for death-yet wamps are not foolish. Against canny foes, wamps can be as silent as the grave before springing to the attack.

  A wamp's body is 4 feet in diameter, but its 3-foot-long limbs give it a gangly leg span of 8 feet. It weighs 300 pounds and typically carries with it the faint and unsettling stench of rotting flesh.

##### Description

Wamps dwell in the dead cities of the Dreamlands, particularly within necropolises or undead-haunted graveyards, where they can hunt their favored prey—unliving creatures with decaying flesh—with ease. A _wamp_ is a vaguely arachnid creature, albeit one with nine legs that end in webbed feet colored a brilliant red, as if the creature had just finished wading through a pool of fresh gore. The _wamp_’s face combines the least attractive features of a pig and a bat, but without the eyes. Covered with bristly pale fur save for their crimson feet, wamps often invite comparison to blood-smeared bones due to their coloration. Wamps often chuckle and chortle as they draw near their prey, eschewing ambush tactics in favor of a more disturbing _[[feats/Opening Volley|opening volley]]_ of mockery designed to let their victims know that they have been marked for death—yet wamps are not foolish. Against canny foes, wamps can be as silent as the grave before springing to the attack.

A _wamp_’s body is 4 feet in diameter, but its 3-foot-long limbs give it a gangly leg span of 8 feet. It weighs 300 pounds and typically carries with it the faint and unsettling _[[universal monster rules/Stench|stench]]_ of rotting flesh.
