  Dust Cloud (Ex): Three times per day as a move action, a sorico can shake loose
    a cloud of dust and sand from its coat that fills its space, providing concealment
    for 1 round. A light wind disperses this cloud immediately. Any creatures sharing
    a sorico's space when it uses this ability must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save
    or they become staggered for 1 round as they cough and sneeze. Creatures that
    don't breathe are immune to this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: Also called dustshroud rabbits, soricos dig out warrens in the desert sands,
  where they remain protected from the elements and predators alike. These communal
  animals live in vast tunneling colonies like ants, each working endlessly to provide
  for the warren. They dig tunnels and burrows, shoring up the sides of the passages
  with sticky saliva that hardens into a temporary cement. Since they constantly toil
  in their warrens, their tawny fur collects fine dust and sand particles. As an instinctive
  means of defense, soricos shake themselves violently, which loosens the sand and
  creates a distracting cloud of dust that allows them to escape from predators. Soricos
  measure 3 feet long, stand 2 feet tall, and weigh 100 pounds. Those who hunt soricos
  find their meat delicious, comparable to that of a farm-raised rabbit.

##### Description

Also _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ dustshroud rabbits, soricos dig out warrens in the desert sands, where they remain protected from the elements and predators alike. These communal animals live in vast tunneling colonies like ants, each working endlessly to provide for the warren. They dig tunnels and burrows, shoring up the sides of the passages with _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Sticky|sticky]]_ saliva that hardens into a temporary cement. Since they constantly toil in their warrens, their tawny fur collects fine dust and sand particles. As an instinctive means of defense, soricos shake themselves violently, which loosens the sand and creates a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Distracting|distracting]]_ cloud of dust that allows them to escape from predators. Soricos measure 3 feet long, stand 2 feet tall, and weigh 100 pounds. Those who hunt soricos find their meat delicious, comparable to that of a farm-raised rabbit.
