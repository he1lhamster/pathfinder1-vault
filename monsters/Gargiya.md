special_abilities:
  Boiling Seas (Ex): Once per minute, a gargiya can concentrate the heat within its
    body, causing seawater in a 20-foot radius to boil for 1d6 rounds. All creatures
    caught in this boiling seawater take 4d8 points of fire damage. Creatures spending
    2 or more consecutive rounds subjected to this damage must succeed at a DC 22
    Fortitude save or fall unconscious. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Dying Gasp (Su): When a gargiya is killed, it disgorges from its gullet the molten
    boulder that heats its body. Its fiery death throes deal 6d6 points of fire damage
    to all creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst. A DC 22 Reflex save halves this
    damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Scalding Scales (Ex): A gargiya generates such intense heat that anything touching
    it takes 2d6 points of fire damage. Creatures striking a gargiya with natural
    attacks or unarmed strikes are subject to this damage. Any metal weapon striking
    a gargiya must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or melt, gaining the broken condition.
    A metal weapon that fails a second save is destroyed. Wooden weapons are destroyed
    after only one failed save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: |-
  Crueler and more volatile than their sea-serpent cousins, gargiyas gravitate toward and sustain themselves on seismic hotspots. Far from being a danger to the beasts, these bubbling crevices spew a form of magma that imbues gargiyas with incredible abilities. From birth, gargiyas ingest magma bubbling up from the ocean floor. By the time they've reached maturity, the monsters develop a molten core in their gullets that allows them to call forth scalding heat at will. Gargiyas' aggressive tendencies toward seafarers have garnered them a wellearned nickname-“boiler beasts.”

  Gargiyas' affinity for all things volcanic has left a pattern of stippled crimson on their massive, snake-like bodies. The spiny frills jutting from their heads and necks resemble enormous, iron-forged blades, and hundreds of stubby appendages line the sides of their underbellies, wriggling ominously when the beasts rear from the sea. Of all the gargiyas' features, though, perhaps the most intimidating are their eyes and maws, which seethe with the light and heat of burning coals-particularly when the beasts are aggravated. Capable of slithering through water like an enormous python, a gargiya stretches 30 feet in length and weighs up to 5 tons.

##### Description

Crueler and more volatile than their sea-serpent cousins, gargiyas gravitate toward and sustain themselves on seismic hotspots. Far from being a danger to the beasts, these bubbling crevices spew a form of magma that imbues gargiyas with incredible abilities. From birth, gargiyas ingest magma bubbling up from the ocean floor. By the time they’ve reached maturity, the monsters develop a molten core in their gullets that allows them to call forth scalding _heat_ at will. Gargiyas’ aggressive tendencies toward seafarers have garnered them a wellearned nickname—“boiler beasts.”

Gargiyas’ affinity for all things _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Volcanic|volcanic]]_ has left a pattern of stippled crimson on their massive, snake-like bodies. The spiny frills jutting from their heads and necks resemble enormous, iron-forged blades, and hundreds of stubby appendages line the sides of their underbellies, wriggling ominously when the beasts rear from the sea. Of all the gargiyas’ features, though, perhaps the most intimidating are their eyes and maws, which seethe with the light and _heat_ of _burning_ coals—particularly when the beasts are aggravated. Capable of _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Slithering|slithering]]_ through water like an enormous python, a _gargiya_ stretches 30 feet in length and weighs up to 5 tons.
