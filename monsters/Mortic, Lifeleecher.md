### Special Abilities

**Create Spawn (Su)** Any humanoid creature slain by a mortic’s

leech life special ability becomes a _[[monsters/Wight|wight]]_ in 1d4 rounds.

Wights spawned by a lifeleecher mortic have penalties like

true _wight_ spawn, and they are under the _[[spells/Command|command]]_ of the

mortic who created them for a period of 24 hours, after

which they collapse to the ground, devoid of any animating

power, and become mundane corpses. These spawn do not

have any of the abilities they had in life.

**Leech Life (Su)** Three times per day as an immediate

action after a successful bite attack, a lifeleecher mortic

can siphon a portion of its target’s life energy into itself.

This functions as the _[[universal monster rules/Energy Drain|energy drain]]_ universal monster rule.

If the mortic drains a level in this way, the mortic gains the

benefits of a _[[spells/Haste|haste]]_ spell (CL 8th).

**Mortic _Ferocity_ (Su)** A lifeleecher mortic has _ferocity_, as the

universal monster rule. However, when the lifeleecher

mortic falls below 0 hit points, it does not lose any hit points

per round and it is not _[[conditions/Staggered|staggered]]_. A lifeleecher mortic still

dies when it reaches a negative number of hit points equal

to its Constitution score. Lifeleecher mortics fighting in this

state are driven by instinct and default to attacking with

their natural weapons, bolstered by their leech life and

_death knell_ abilities. Using manufactured weapons or using

any other tactics or abilities requires the lifeleecher mortic to

succeed at a DC 17 Will saving throw to suppress its instincts.

**_Resurrection_ _[[curses/Vulnerability|Vulnerability]]_ (Su)** A _[[spells/Raise Dead|raise dead]]_ or similar spell

cast on a lifeleecher mortic staggers it for 1d4 rounds unless

the mortic succeeds at a Will save against the caster’s saving

throw DC for that spell. Using the spell in this way does not

require a material component. When _staggered_ due to such

an effect, a lifeleecher mortic cannot use its leech life special

ability and its mortic _ferocity_ ability is suppressed. If the

lifeleecher mortic is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points while

affected by a _raise dead_ effect, it immediately gains the

_staggered_ condition and loses 1 hit point per round.

##### Description

Much like some of their _orc_ kin, lifeleecher mortics

often cover themselves in ritual scarring, brands, and

auspicious tattoos. However, a lifeleecher mortic’s skin

is an ashen _[[monsters/Gray|gray]]_ color, signaling their flirtation with

death. Of all their markings, lifeleecher mortics most

celebrate their death scar: the site of a mortal wound that

would have felled creatures far more resilient than an

_orc_, yet that failed to slay the lifeleecher mortic, instead

unleashing their mortic heritage.

Lifeleecher mortics are roughly 6 feet tall and weigh

about 230 pounds.
