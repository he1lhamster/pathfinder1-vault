  Incombustible Aura (Su): All creatures within 30 feet of a wood idol gain fire resistance
    10. This effect lasts as long as a creature remains within the wood idol's aura.
    Any time a being makes use of this resistance to any degree, the wood idol takes
    1 point of normal damage, appearing more and more charred as it takes damage.
    This ability ceases to function should a wood idol have only 1 hit point and does
    not reactivate until it regains hit points.
  Primeval Curse (Su): Once per day, a wood idol can force a creature within 15 feet
    to make a DC 12 Will save or be cursed. This curse functions similarly to the
    spell bestow curse, except that it can only either decrease an ability score by
    -4 or cause a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks.
    In addition, while affected, the skin of the target takes on a rough, wooden appearance.
    A wood idol's curse can only affect one creature at a time, and should it curse
    another creature, the first target is no longer affected. This effect can be removed
    by remove curse or by eating a goodberry. The save DC is Charisma based.
  Regeneration (Ex): A wood idol's regeneration only functions while it is standing
    on wood, grass, or earth. Fire deals normal damage to a wood idol.
desc_long: Among rare druidic circles, tribes of the deep jungle, and the mysterious
  people of the distant west, wood idols frequently serve as representations of powerful
  spirits of the wilds, who these nature devotees propitiate with sacrifices. The
  superstitions of strange shamans hold that spirits possess the idols when the sacrifices
  are made, consuming the offering before returning from whence they came. Yet those
  who would offend these forces must beware, as they manipulate eldritch powers of
  the world and might curse one's every effort. While many question the truths of
  such beliefs, few who impugn the might of such spirits survive the ire of their
  shaman-creators' devout congregations.

**Incombustible Aura (Su)** All creatures within 30 feet of a wood idol gain fire _[[universal monster rules/Resistance|resistance]]_ 10. This effect lasts as long as a creature remains within the wood idol’s aura.

This curse functions similarly to the spell _[[spells/Bestow Curse|bestow curse]]_, except that it can only either decrease an ability score by –4 or cause a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks. In addition, while affected, the skin of the target takes on a rough, wooden appearance. A wood idol’s curse can only affect one creature at a time, and should it curse another creature, the first target is no longer affected. This effect can be removed by _[[spells/Remove Curse|remove curse]]_ or by eating a _goodberry_. The save DC is Charisma based.

**_Regeneration_ (Ex)** A wood idol’s _regeneration_ only functions while it is standing on wood, grass, or earth. Fire deals normal damage to a wood idol.
