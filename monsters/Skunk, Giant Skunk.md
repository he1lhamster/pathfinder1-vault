  Musk (Ex): Up to twice per day, a giant skunk can spray a stream of noxious musk
    at a single target within 30 feet as a standard action. With a successful ranged
    touch attack, the creature struck by this spray must make a DC 17 Fortitude save
    or be nauseated for 1d6 rounds and then sickened for 1d6 minutes by the horrific
    stench. A successful save reduces the effect to only 1d4 rounds of being sickened.
    A creature cannot use the scent ability as long as it is affected by this musk.
    The save DC is Constitution-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus.
desc_long: Much larger than their passive cousins, giant skunks are an aggressive
  lot. Having a greater bulk to maintain, giant skunks feed on creatures beyond just
  grubs and insects, often hunting small mammals and reptiles by night in addition
  to giant versions of insects. While giant skunks are dangerous to nearby settlements,
  farmers find a positive aspect in their presence, valuing the creatures' taste for
  giant insects and other more dangerous vermin.

##### Description

Much larger than their passive cousins, giant skunks are an aggressive lot. Having a greater bulk to maintain, giant skunks feed on creatures beyond just grubs and insects, often hunting small mammals and reptiles by night in addition to giant versions of insects. While giant skunks are dangerous to nearby settlements, farmers find a positive aspect in their presence, valuing the creatures’ taste for giant insects and other more dangerous vermin.
