##### Description

One of the most famous tsukumogami is the one-eyed

and one-legged umbrella creature known as kasaobake,

a creature that is alternately creepy, curious, and

mischievous. Kasa-obake are as likely to _[[spells/Scare|scare]]_ a creature

away as they are to assist it, though their seemingly

unpredictable nature always has a pattern behind it.

For instance, most kasa-obake react more positively to

those who treat their belongings well. Kasa-obake can be

sources of wisdom if approached correctly, but they are

also likely to tell amusing tall tales instead of the truth.
