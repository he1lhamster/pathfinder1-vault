title1: Clockwork, Clockwork Excavator
desc_short: Set atop spoked wheels, this huge contraption has two hinged arms that
  appear to be designed to shovel rocks into its open maw. Gleaming drills set around
  the construct's base look like they could easily break apart stone, and a gleaming
  scope of dark-hued glass projects from the end of a jointed arm.

  Explosive Charge (Su): A clockwork excavator can create alchemical explosives that
    aid it in clearing particularly dense areas of rock. Three times per day, an excavator
    can launch a cylindrical explosive charge as a ranged attack, targeting any grid
    intersection within 30 feet. A thrown charge detonates 1d4-1 rounds after being
    released (a result of 0 causes it to detonate upon impact), creating a 10-foot
    burst that deals 2d6 points of fire damage and 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage
    (bypassing objects' hardness). Creatures in the blast radius can attempt a DC
    16 Reflex saving throw for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Metal Sense (Su): When a clockwork excavator is wound, the operator can place 1
    pound of one type of gem, metal ore, or mineral in the construct's headpiece,
    keying the clockwork to search for the desired material within 120 feet. If the
    construct does not immediately sense the presence of its target, it begins searching
    in a clockwise spiral from its activation point outward until it needs to be wound
    again (barring any other instructions from its operator). Placing an artificial
    or mixed material, such as steel, bronze, or alloyed coins, in the construct's
    head keys the excavator to one of the material's base elements (at random) and
    the creature has a cumulative 5% chance of going berserk every hour of operation.
    A berserk excavator goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or
    object, then moving on to spread more destruction until it needs to be wound again.
  Pulverizing Ray (Su): A clockwork excavator can make short work of obstacles in
    its way with a powerful sonic ray. This functions as a breath weapon usable every
    1d4 rounds.
  Superior Craftsmanship (Ex): Clockwork excavators are designed to be able to break
    apart almost any material as part of their mining duties. The drill bits on a
    clockwork excavator are crafted from adamantine and ignore all hardness, and the
    construct does not rust.
desc_long: The product of greed and invention, clockwork excavators are designed to
  strip-mine an area in pursuit of mineral wealth. Found in areas where such desires
  override any concern for the natural environment, clockwork excavators are durable,
  tough, and purpose-driven.

Three times per day, an excavator can launch a cylindrical explosive charge as a ranged attack, targeting any grid intersection within 30 feet. A thrown charge detonates 1d4–1 rounds after being released (a result of 0 causes it to _[[spells/Detonate|detonate]]_ upon _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Impact|impact]]_), creating a 10-foot burst that deals 2d6 points of fire damage and 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (bypassing objects’ hardness). Creatures in the blast radius can attempt a DC 16 Reflex saving throw for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
