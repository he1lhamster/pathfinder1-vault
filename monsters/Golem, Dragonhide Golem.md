  Berserk (Ex): When a dragonhide golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 2% chance
    each round that the lingering primal presence in its draconic grafts overwhelms
    the golem, causing it to go berserk. It takes 1 minute of inactivity by the golem
    to reset the golem's berserk chance to 0%; alternatively, the creator can offer
    the golem a tribute of coins and gems in an attempt to calm the lingering draconic
    presence. For every 500 gp offered in tribute, the golem's berserk chance is lowered
    by 1%. Once berserk, the uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest
    living creature or smashing some object smaller than itself if no creature is
    within reach, then moving on to spread more destruction. The golem's creator,
    if within 60 feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly and persuasively
    to the golem, requiring a successful DC 25 Charisma check.
  Breath Weapon (Su): |-
    A dragonhide golem's breath weapon depends on the type of dragon whose head was grafted onto the creature, as summarized on the table below. Regardless of type, a dragonhide golem's breath weapon deals 20d6 points of damage and is usable once every 1d4 rounds. A target that succeeds at a DC 22 Reflex save takes half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

     To determine a dragonhide golem's breath weapon randomly, roll 1d10 and consult the table below.

  Draconic Grafts: |-
    Dragonhide golems have several draconic grafts upon their giant bodies to enhance their abilities and defenses. Most dragonhide golems have three draconic grafts; however, the creator can add any number of additional grafts, with each additional graft beyond the third increasing the cost of the golem by 15,000 gp. For every two additional grafts beyond the third, the golem's CR increases by 1. Unless otherwise noted, each draconic graft can be selected only once. Draconic grafts are chosen from those presented below.

     Dragonlike Senses (Ex): The dragonhide golem has darkvision out to 120 feet and blindsense out to 60 feet. It can see four times as well as a human in dim light and twice as well in normal light, and it receives a circumstance bonus on Perception checks equal to 5 + the golem's number of Hit Dice. This replaces the golem's standard darkvision of 60 feet and low-light vision. 

    Elemental Aura (Su): The dragonhide golem's body is surrounded by an aura of acid, cold, electricity, or fire, dealing 2d6 points of energy damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the golem at the start of its turn. The type of energy damage must be the same as one of the golem's breath weapons. This aura can be activated or dismissed as a free action. If the golem has more than one type of breath weapon, it can select the energy type each round. 

    Full-Body Scales (Ex): The dragonhide golem's body is fully encased in a thick layer of dragon scales, increasing its natural armor bonus by 2 and granting it immunity to a single type of energy (and possibly a vulnerability as well), as determined by the type of dragon the scales are taken from. Silver or white dragons grant immunity to cold, but also vulnerability to fire. Blue or bronze dragons grant immunity to electricity. Brass, gold, or red dragons grant immunity to fire, but also vulnerability to cold. If a dragonhide golem is immune to cold and fire, it loses vulnerability to cold and fire. This draconic graft can be selected any number of times. Each time this draconic graft is selected, it gains an additional +2 natural armor bonus and an additional energy immunity (and possibly a vulnerability as well). 

    Graft Head (Su): The dragonhide golem's head is formed from one additional type of dragon. Each time this draconic graft is selected, it gains a different type of breath weapon, although the breath weapon is still usable only once every 1d4 rounds. This draconic graft can be selected any number of times. 

    Powerful Tail (Ex): The dragonhide golem gains a tail attack usable as a secondary attack. It deals 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on damage rolls with its tail attack.

    Wings (Ex): A pair of dragon wings are grafted onto the golem's back, granting a fly speed of 100 feet with clumsy maneuverability. This draconic graft can be selected up to four times. Each additional time this draconic graft is selected, it improves the golem's fly speed by 50 feet and its maneuverability by one step, to a maximum fly speed of 250 feet with good maneuverability.
  Immunity to Magic (Ex): A dragonhide golem is immune to any spell or spell-like
    ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects
    function differently against this creature, as noted below. A flesh to stone spell
    slows a dragonhide golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw.
    A rage spell increases a dragonhide golem's chance to go berserk by 50%, with
    no saving throw.
  Rampage (Su): Whenever a dragonhide golem goes berserk, its draconic grafts are
    temporarily empowered. It gains a +8 enhancement bonus to Strength, a +4 enhancement
    bonus to Dexterity, and a +4 enhancement bonus to natural armor. This effect ends
    when the golem's berserk chance is reset to 0%.
desc_long: A dragonhide golem is a terrifying humanoid monstrosity created from the
  body of a giant with all manner of parts from dragon corpses grafted onto it.
