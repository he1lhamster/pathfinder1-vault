  Barbed Defense (Su): A creature that strikes a hamatula with a melee weapon, an
    unarmed strike, or a natural weapon takes 1d8+6 points of piercing damage from
    the devil's barbs. Melee weapons with reach do not endanger a user in this way.
  Fear (Su): A barbed devil's fear attack affects any creature it damages with its
    claws. A DC 20 Will save resists this effect, otherwise the victim becomes frightened
    for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Grab (Ex): A barbed devil can use its grab attack against a foe of up to Medium
    size.
  Impale (Ex): A barbed devil deals 3d8+9 points of piercing damage to a grabbed opponent
    with a successful grapple check.
desc_long: |-
  Sentinels of the vaults of Hell, jailers of the darkest souls, and living weapons of the infernal forges, barbed devils-known as hamatulas to diabolists-enforce the strictures of the damned and safeguard the nefarious works of greater devils. A hamatula enjoys the feel of warm blood on its spines, and prefers to leap into melee when presented with an opportunity for battle.

  Hamatulas are collectors and organizers, and are favorite allies of greedy summoners as they often bring with them tempting treasures from Hell's vaults or know the paths to deadly riches. Left to their own devices, the lairs of these devils often bear the pierced trophies of their past victims, hung like perverse bug collections on bloodied walls. Most barbed devils stand upward of 7 feet tall and weigh 300 pounds, though their leanly muscled bodies appear much larger due to the constantly growing and adjusting spines that protrude from their razor-sharp bodies.

##### Description

Sentinels of the vaults of Hell, jailers of the darkest souls, and living weapons of the infernal forges, barbed devils—known as hamatulas to diabolists—enforce the strictures of the _[[feats/Damned|damned]]_ and safeguard the nefarious works of greater devils. A hamatula enjoys the feel of warm blood on its spines, and prefers to leap into melee when presented with an opportunity for battle.

Hamatulas are collectors and organizers, and are favorite allies of greedy summoners as they often bring with them tempting treasures from Hell’s vaults or know the paths to _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Deadly|deadly]]_ riches. Left to their own devices, the lairs of these devils often bear the pierced trophies of their past victims, hung like perverse bug collections on bloodied walls. Most barbed devils stand upward of 7 feet tall and weigh 300 pounds, though their leanly muscled bodies appear much larger due to the constantly _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Growing|growing]]_ and adjusting spines that protrude from their razor-sharp bodies.
