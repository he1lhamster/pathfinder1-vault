### Special Abilities

**_Change Shape_ (Su)** A _skinwalker_

can _change shape_ to a bestial form

as a standard action. In bestial form,

a _skinwalker_ gains a +2 racial bonus

to his choice of Strength, Dexterity,

or Constitution. While in this form, a

_skinwalker_ also takes on an animalistic

feature that provides a special effect.

Each time a _skinwalker_ assumes bestial

form, he can choose to gain two claw attacks

that each deal 1d4 points of damage, 60 foot

_[[spells/Darkvision|darkvision]]_, or a +1 natural armor bonus.

These benefits last until the _skinwalker_ returns to his

humanoid form as a swift action. A _skinwalker_ must first

return to his humanoid form before changing to bestial form

again to change benefits. The _skinwalker_ presented here is

currently in bestial form, and has claw attacks and a +2 racial

bonus to Strength.

##### Description

Most people believe that skinwalkers are half-breeds

of lycanthropes, or that they possess a weaker version of

the _[[universal monster rules/Curse of Lycanthropy|curse of lycanthropy]]_. However, _skinwalker_ shamans

claim that their people were chosen by the gods as a bridge

between humanity and animals. Either way, skinwalkers

resemble humans much of the time, but they have the

uncanny ability to transform into bestial humanoids with

powerful and fearsome aspects of animals.
