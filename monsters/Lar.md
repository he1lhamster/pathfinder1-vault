  Genius Loci (Su): As a free action, a lar can possess any inanimate object with
    which it comes into contact, thereby animating it under its control. The object
    and lar merge, taking on the statistics of an animated object of the same size
    (see animated objects in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). A lar may possess any object
    of Tiny to Large size. If the animated object is destroyed or targeted by dispel
    good, the lar is expelled and takes 1d6 points of damage per size category of
    the possessed object-1d6 for a Tiny object, 2d6 for a Small object, and so on.
    The lar is then free to possess another object, if one is available. If a lar
    is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, it is banished to its statua for 24 hours,
    after which it is fully healed. If the lar does not have a statua, or the statua
    is destroyed while it is at 0 or fewer hit points, the lar is killed.
  Natural Invisibility (Su): This ability is constant, allowing a lar to remain invisible
    even when attacking. This ability is inherent and not subject to the invisibility
    purge spell.
  Statua (Su): All lares rely on a small stone figure, known as a statua, for survival.
    This figurine serves as a lar's home, resting place, and tie to the Material Plane.
    Lares typically rest within their statua, finding it a comfortable place from
    which to oversee their surroundings. For every round a lar spends doing nothing
    besides resting within its statua, it regenerates 1 point of damage. However,
    being separated from the statua for extended periods of time weakens the lar.
    For every 5 hours a lar remains outside of its statua, it takes 1d6 points of
    nonlethal damage. Only returning to the statua can heal this damage. If a lar
    falls to 0 hit points, even from nonlethal damage, it is banished back to the
    Upper Planes. While a lar's statua exists, the connected lar is treated as a native
    outsider. Any attempt to banish the lar-through dismissal or a similar spell-merely
    transports the creature back to its statua. If the statua is destroyed, a lar
    can be dismissed from the Material Plane as normal.
  Suggestion (Sp): A lar can influence creatures as per the spell suggestion, with
    some variations, at will. First, to influence a creature in this manner, a lar
    must occupy the same square as its target. The lar is considered to be able to
    speak any language and communicate with any creature-even animals and vermin (which
    are usually immune to mind-affecting effects)-for the purposes of this effect.
    The target may attempt to resist a lar's suggestion by making a DC 17 Will save.
    The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
desc_long: |-
  Sometimes referred to as “watchsouls,” lares are subtle, benevolent spirits that prefer to spend their existence on the Material Plane minding the homes and fortunes of deserving mortals. Kind but aloof, lares watch over their mortal wards and help only when they are most needed. Yet where their homes are intruded upon or their charges imperiled, they prove frighteningly effective guardians, turning everything in their tiny dominions into living weapons.

  Lares are innately invisible, making the nature of their existence something of a mystery. Originating from the Upper Planes, these spirits have no true bodies and appear only as vague spectral eddies to those capable of seeing invisible beings. Yet while their forms prove vague, their blessings are undeniable.

### Special Abilities

**Genius Loci (Su)** As a free action, a _[[monsters/Lar|lar]]_ can possess any inanimate object with which it comes into contact, thereby animating it under its control. The object and _lar_ merge, taking on the statistics of an _[[monsters/Animated Object|animated object]]_ of the same size (see _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Animated|animated]]_ objects in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). A _lar_ may possess any object of Tiny to Large size. If the _animated object_ is destroyed or targeted by _[[spells/Dispel Good|dispel good]]_, the _lar_ is expelled and takes 1d6 points of damage per size category of the possessed object—1d6 for a Tiny object, 2d6 for a Small object, and so on. The _lar_ is then free to possess another object, if one is available. If a _lar_ is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, it is banished to its statua for 24 hours, after which it is fully healed. If the _lar_ does not have a statua, or the statua is destroyed while it is at 0 or fewer hit points, the _lar_ is killed.

**_[[universal monster rules/Natural Invisibility|Natural Invisibility]]_ (Su)** This ability is constant, allowing a _lar_ to remain _invisible_ even when attacking. This ability is inherent and not subject to the _[[spells/Invisibility Purge|invisibility purge]]_ spell.
**Statua (Su)** All lares rely on a small stone figure, known as a statua, for survival. This figurine serves as a _lar_’s home, resting place, and tie to the Material Plane. Lares typically rest within their statua, finding it a comfortable place from which to oversee their surroundings. For every round a _lar_ spends doing nothing besides resting within its statua, it regenerates 1 point of damage. However, being separated from the statua for extended periods of time weakens the _lar_. For every 5 hours a _lar_ remains outside of its statua, it takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Only returning to the statua can _heal_ this damage. If a _lar_ falls to 0 hit points, even from nonlethal damage, it is banished back to the Upper Planes. While a _lar_’s statua exists, the connected _lar_ is treated as a native outsider. Any attempt to banish the _lar_—through _[[spells/Dismissal|dismissal]]_ or a similar spell—merely transports the creature back to its statua. If the statua is destroyed, a _lar_ can be dismissed from the Material Plane as normal.
**_Suggestion_ (Sp)** A _lar_ can influence creatures as per the spell _suggestion_, with some variations, at will. First, to influence a creature in this manner, a _lar_ must occupy the same square as its target. The _lar_ is considered to be able to speak any language and communicate with any creature—even animals and vermin (which are usually immune to mind-affecting effects)—for the purposes of this effect.

##### Description

Sometimes referred to as “watchsouls,” lares are subtle, _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Benevolent|benevolent]]_ spirits that prefer to spend their existence on the Material Plane minding the homes and fortunes of deserving mortals. Kind but aloof, lares watch over their mortal wards and help only when they are most needed. Yet where their homes are intruded upon or their charges imperiled, they prove frighteningly effective guardians, turning everything in their tiny dominions into living weapons.

Lares are innately _invisible_, making the nature of their existence something of a mystery. Originating from the Upper Planes, these spirits have no true bodies and appear only as vague spectral eddies to those capable of seeing _invisible_ beings. Yet while their forms prove vague, their blessings are undeniable.
