### Special Abilities

**Digest (Ex)** A target that takes swarm damage from an

_[[monsters/Undigested|undigested]]_ swarm is covered in acidic slime and must

succeed at a DC 16 Reflex save or take 2d6 points of acid

damage for 1d4 rounds at the start of its turn. An affected

creature can make a new save as a full-round action.

Washing off the acid grants a +4 bonus on this save. The

save DC is Constitution-based.

##### Description

Whereas individual _undigested_ are more of a nuisance

than a threat to adventurers, a swarm of such creatures

can be dangerous to even experienced adventurers.

An _undigested_ swarm comprises hundreds of

individual _undigested_. Driven by insatiable

hunger, they fall upon and consume any

living creatures crossing their path,

surrounding the unfortunate

victims and drenching

them in acidic slime,

digesting their still-living

prey even before the screaming ends.
