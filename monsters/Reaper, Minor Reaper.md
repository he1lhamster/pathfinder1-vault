  Death Touch (Su): Creatures hit by either a lesser reaper's touch attack or by a
    weapon wielded by a lesser reaper must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or gain
    1d4 negative levels. The save DC is Charisma-based. A humanoid slain by a reaper's
    death touch is consumed in unholy fire and has its remains destroyed as the destruction
    spell. This is a death effect.
  Sole Target (Su): |-
    Each minor reaper is assigned a specific target by the reaper that summoned it. If a creature attacks a minor reaper targeting another creature, that minor reaper may immediately summon another minor reaper as a free action to battle the interceding creature unless the interloper is already in battle with a minor reaper of its own, in which case the ability is wasted. If a minor reaper does not or cannot use this ability immediately after being attacked, it must wait until it is attacked once again in order to do so.

    Known by many names throughout nearly all cultures, grim reapers are the personifications of death and all the pain and fear associated with that state. They are universally feared by the living as harbingers of destruction and masters of all that has already passed from life. These hooded beings travel through the planes with the sole intent of bringing about the end of life, slaying with a deliberateness inscrutable to all but themselves.

    While grim reapers are the most feared of their kind, they are not alone. The towering, ghostlike grim reapers are served by minor reapers, corporeal servitors that enact their master's dreadful will and meet out death's unrelenting touch. A grim reaper is 15 feet tall and, as an incorporeal creature, has no physical weight except for its equipment. Minor reapers stand 7 feet tall and weigh approximately 70 pounds.
