  Hurtling Charge (Ex): A ravenous tumbleweed that travels at least 20 feet as part
    of a charge action does not provoke an attack of opportunity when it enters an
    opponent's space to make a melee attack.
  Wind-Borne (Ex): While in an area of moderate wind (11-20 mph), a ravenous tumbleweed's
    speed increases by 10 feet when it moves in the direction of the wind. In an area
    of at least strong wind (21+ mph), its speed instead increases by 20 feet when
    it moves in the direction of the wind, and it gains a +2 dodge bonus to its AC
    against attacks of opportunity on any round in which it moves in that direction.
desc_long: Unlike its harmless counterpart, a ravenous tumbleweed uproots itself when
  nutrients are scarce in order to hunt down live prey. These seasonally carnivorous
  plants gather into imposing drifts that wait for periods of high winds before overwhelming
  birds, rabbits, and even deer.
