    a deflection bonus to its AC and a resistance bonus on Reflex saves equal to its
    Charisma modifier (+5 for the typical gravesludge).
  Lifeleech (Su): When a gravesludge deals negative energy damage to a creature, that
    creature continues to take 1d6 points of negative energy damage at the start of
    its turn each round. This effect can be stopped via magical healing, and otherwise
    stops on its own 3 rounds after the initial slam attack. Multiple slam attacks
    extend the duration of this ongoing negative energy damage but do not increase
    the amount of damage.
  Swift Slam (Ex): A gravesludge can attack twice with its slam attack as a standard
    action.
desc_long: |-
  Gravesludges straddle the line between oozes and undead. Primarily made of ectoplasm and grave dirt, gravesludges spontaneously arise in areas where a grave is desecrated, near strong haunt activity, and in the defiled graves of unhallowed cemeteries. Intelligent undead often entreat gravesludges to bolster their defenses, but solitary gravesludges wander cemeteries, charnel houses, and ossuaries, driven by little more than a burning jealousy and hatred for the living. Occasionally, living creatures work with a gravesludge to secure a grisly form of life after death as juju zombies. 

  The average gravesludge measures 6 feet across and weighs 750 pounds.

##### Description

Gravesludges straddle the line between oozes and undead. Primarily made of ectoplasm and grave dirt, gravesludges spontaneously arise in areas where a grave is desecrated, near strong haunt activity, and in the defiled graves of unhallowed cemeteries. Intelligent undead often entreat gravesludges to bolster their defenses, but solitary gravesludges wander cemeteries, charnel houses, and ossuaries, driven by little more than a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Burning|burning]]_ jealousy and hatred for the living. Occasionally, living creatures work with a _gravesludge_ to secure a grisly form of life after death as juju zombies.

The average _gravesludge_ measures 6 feet across and weighs 750 pounds.
