**Booster Jets (Ex)** As a swift action up to 10 times per

hour, an annihilator can gain a fly speed of 60 feet (poor

maneuverability) for a duration of 1 minute.

**Chain Guns (Ex)** These advanced firearms have a range

new ammunition, effectively giving the annihilator infinite

ammunition with these weapons.

**Plasma _Lance_ (Ex)** As a standard action once every 3 rounds,

an annihilator can fire a 120-foot-long line of plasma from

its tail. All creatures in this area take 20d6 points of damage

electricity. The save DC is Intelligence-based.
**Suppressing Fire (Ex)** As a standard action, an annihilator can

use its chain guns to fire in a 100-foot cone. When it does

so, it makes a single chain gun attack against every target in

this area.

##### Description

The enormous and formidable annihilator robots

roam old ruins and wastelands, ridding them of all

life and civilization. They _[[feats/Smash|smash]]_ structures, slaughter

creatures both sentient and bestial, and scorch plant life

to ashes. When _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Rampaging|rampaging]]_, an annihilator indiscriminately

destroys rather than following the meticulous approach

many other robots take with their work. Despite the

_[[spells/Destruction|destruction]]_ they wreak, annihilators often gather up

those who survive their assaults, collecting the _[[conditions/Dying|dying]]_ and

_[[conditions/Unconscious|unconscious]]_ from battlefields and bringing them to a set

location. Their purpose for keeping these battered but

still-living prisoners is _[[monsters/Unknown|unknown]]_.
