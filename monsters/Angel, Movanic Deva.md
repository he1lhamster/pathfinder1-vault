  Protected Life Force (Ex): Movanic devas are never harmed by positive-dominant or

desc_long: Movanic devas serve as infantry in the celestial armies, though they spend
  most of their time patrolling the Positive, Negative, and Material Planes. On the
  Positive Plane, they watch over wandering good souls, which sometimes puts them
  into conflict with the jyoti. On the Negative Plane, they battle undead, the sceaduinar,
  and the other strange things that hunt in the hungry void. Their rare visits to
  the Material Plane are usually to help powerful mortals when a great menace threatens
  to plunge an entire realm into evil.
