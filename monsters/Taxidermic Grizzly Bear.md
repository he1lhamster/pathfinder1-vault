##### Description

Taxidermic creatures are the work of obsessed individuals

seeking to use their alchemical or occult talents to _[[spells/Preserve|preserve]]_

and reanimate lifeless beings. The abilities of taxidermic

creatures often pale in comparison to those of their living

counterparts, as they are bereft of intelligence or an animate

life force to guide them. Instead, taxidermic creatures

possess a rudimentary form of instinct, though they are

still able to follow basic instructions from their creators.

Less refined than the magic used to animate undead,

golems, and other constructs, the creation of a taxidermic

creature is at best an inaccurate science. There is no one

method of crafting a taxidermic creature, so each result

is different. Every creature crafted in such a manner is

_[[conditions/Prone|prone]]_ to inherent defects based on the materials used or

shortcuts taken during the process, and may or may not

be able to obey its creators commands in a satisfactory

manner. Because of taxidermic creatures’ limited mental

faculties, their creators must be extremely careful and

literal when commanding them.

Left unattended, taxidermic creatures stand in place,

having no need to drink, eat, or sleep. Unless given

specific commands, the actions of these creatures

are unpredictable. Each taxidermic creature behaves

differently, depending on the quirks of its individual

construction. Some taxidermic creatures move and act

like prowling animals, while others move with the rigidity

and unerring purpose of _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Animated|animated]]_ objects. Some twisted

taxidermists have gone so far as to create taxidermic

humanoids, aberrations, and even fey.
