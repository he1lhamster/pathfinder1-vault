  Blades (Ex): A harbinger can extend blades from its body to strike with as primary
    natural attacks. These blades possess a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage
    rolls, and are treated as both magic and good-aligned for the purposes of penetrating
    damage reduction.
  Disassemble (Su): As a move-equivalent action, a harbinger can break apart into
    its components. This is treated as gaseous form, except the archon retains its
    full flight speed and DR, and cannot fit through gaps smaller than 1 inch in diameter.
    Reforming into an orrery is a standard action.
  Minor Archon (Ex): Harbinger archons lack the aura of menace and teleport abilities
    of more powerful archons.
  Wrath (Su): Once per minute, a harbinger archon can emit a blast of energy that
    deals 2d6 points of force damage to adjacent creatures. A DC 12 Reflex save halves
    this damage. The harbinger can choose to omit any target from this blast that
    it desires, damaging only those foes it chooses. The save DC is Charisma-based.

  Though counted among the least of the archons, harbingers nonetheless remain steadfast in their dedication to combating evil. These tiny beings serve as heralds and assistants for the forces of Heaven. While on the Material Plane, they advise mortals on how best to serve the causes of order and light. Some even venture to the other Outer Planes as minor ambassadors. Harbingers can also be bound into service as familiars, a role they accept eagerly, taking full responsibility for guiding their masters' souls toward salvation. A spellcaster must have the Improved Familiar feat, a lawful good alignment, and be an arcane caster level of 7th or higher to gain a harbinger familiar.

  A harbinger resembles a whirling mechanical model of a planetary system. Its sun, moons, and planets are crafted of tiny glowing jewels whose color shifts with the harbinger's mood. Electric arcs and sparks of magical essence dance between its whirling pieces. The harbinger can dismantle itself into its component parts to squeeze through tiny gaps, its rings dissolving into glowing vapor while its star and planets remain. Harbingers shed light as brightly as a torch under normal conditions, but can dim to a faint glow if desired, and frequently spin off bits of their essence into dancing lights.

  A harbinger archon's voice resembles the ringing of a dozen tiny bells, and regardless of the language the archon speaks, it retains that tinkling musical quality.

  Most harbinger archons form from souls that led simple lives of wisdom and piety before their deaths. They remember nothing of their mortal existences, but retain a decidedly practical, if parochial, view of worldly matters. Only rarely does a harbinger want for a parable or proverb apropos to the task at hand.

##### Description

Though counted among the least of the archons, harbingers nonetheless remain steadfast in their dedication to combating evil. These tiny beings serve as heralds and assistants for the forces of Heaven. While on the Material Plane, they advise mortals on how best to serve the causes of order and light. Some even venture to the other Outer Planes as minor ambassadors. Harbingers can also be bound into service as familiars, a role they accept eagerly, taking full responsibility for guiding their masters’ souls toward salvation. A spellcaster must have the _[[feats/Improved Familiar|Improved Familiar]]_ feat, a lawful good alignment, and be an arcane caster level of 7th or higher to gain a harbinger familiar.

A harbinger resembles a whirling mechanical model of a planetary system. Its sun, moons, and planets are crafted of tiny glowing jewels whose color shifts with the harbinger’s mood. Electric arcs and sparks of magical essence dance between its whirling pieces. The harbinger can dismantle itself into its component parts to _[[spells/Squeeze|squeeze]]_ through tiny gaps, its rings dissolving into glowing vapor while its star and planets remain. Harbingers shed light as brightly as a _[[items/Mundane/Torch|torch]]_ under normal conditions, but can dim to a faint glow if desired, and frequently spin off bits of their essence into _dancing lights_.

A harbinger archon’s voice resembles the ringing of a dozen tiny bells, and regardless of the language the archon speaks, it retains that tinkling musical quality.
