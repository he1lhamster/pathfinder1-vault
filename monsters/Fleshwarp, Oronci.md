  Frenzy (Ex): Once per day, an oronci that takes damage in combat can fly into a
    frenzy as a free action the following round. While in this state, an oronci cannot
    use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skill checks, but functions
    as if under the effects of a haste spell. The oronci can continue to frenzy for
    up to 3 rounds, after which it is staggered for 1 round.
  Poison (Ex): Bite-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect
    1d3 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  Spit (Ex): An oronci can spit poison at a target within 30 feet as a standard action.
    This is a ranged touch attack, and can only be performed once every 1d6 rounds.
    If the attack is successful, the target is affected by the poison just as if it
    had been injured. The oronci can still poison a target with each successful bite
    attack.
  Undersized Weapons (Ex): Although an oronci is Large, its upper torso is the same
    size as that of a Medium humanoid. As a result, oronci wield weapons as if they
    were one size category smaller than their actual size (Medium for most oronci).
desc_long: |-
  When drow fleshwarping alchemy is turned and focused upon an orc, the obscene result is called an oronci. Upon submersion in a fleshwarper's alchemical ichor, the unfortunate orc's legs merge, and its lower body turns black and elongates to a length of approximately 15 feet. This new body divides into segments, with each segment sprouting a pair of short, sturdy, thin legs. Finally, the horror's tusks connect to newly grown poison ducts that constantly drip poisonous spittle. The orc's head and upper body stay relatively intact as far as fleshwarping goes, though its eyes sometimes adopt a dark, vacant stare.

  With the exception of the driders, the oronci are among the most useful of the obscenities produced by fleshwarping. They embody all the savage brutality of an orc warrior, but mounted centaurlike upon an even larger, more powerful frame. Being less intelligent than drow, oronci make better shock troopers and advance soldiers for drow armies than the dark elves themselves. Oronci who have escaped the slavery of the dark elves have become favored champions for certain clever orc chieftains. Some oronci even overcome their sensitivity to daylight given time, which makes them better suited to terrorize the surface lands.

##### Description

When _[[monsters/Drow|drow]]_ fleshwarping alchemy is turned and focused upon an _orc_, the obscene result is _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ an oronci. Upon submersion in a _[[feats/Fleshwarper|fleshwarper]]_’s alchemical ichor, the unfortunate _orc_’s legs merge, and its lower body turns black and elongates to a length of approximately 15 feet. This new body divides into segments, with each segment sprouting a pair of short, sturdy, thin legs. Finally, the horror’s tusks connect to newly grown poison ducts that constantly drip poisonous spittle. The _orc_’s head and upper body stay relatively intact as far as fleshwarping goes, though its eyes sometimes adopt a dark, vacant stare.

With the exception of the driders, the oronci are among the most useful of the obscenities produced by fleshwarping. They embody all the savage brutality of an _orc_ warrior, but mounted centaurlike upon an even larger, more powerful frame. Being less intelligent than _drow_, oronci make better _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Shock|shock]]_ troopers and advance soldiers for _drow_ armies than the dark elves themselves. Oronci who have escaped the slavery of the dark elves have become favored champions for certain clever _orc_ chieftains. Some oronci even overcome their sensitivity to _[[spells/Daylight|daylight]]_ given time, which makes them better suited to terrorize the surface lands.
