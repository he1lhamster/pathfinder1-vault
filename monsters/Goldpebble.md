  Chilling Currents (Su): As a free action after it successfully grapples a submerged
    creature, a goldpebble can cause the temperature of all water within a 90-foot-sphere
    spread, centered on itself, to drop several degrees for 1 minute. For the duration
    of this effect, any creature attempting to hold its breath in the affected water
    has the DC of its Constitution check to do so increased by 2.
  Poison (Su): |-
    As an unintentional side effect of the alchemical meddling that brought the creature about, a goldpebble's fangs inflict a dangerous venom that turns its victim's blood to water. Any creature with blood or a similar fluid that is hit by a goldpebble's bite attack risks being affected by this poison.

     Pebblefang: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 16; onset 1d4 hours; frequency 1/day for 8 days; effect 1d3 Con damage, and when the creature fails a save, all bleed damage it takes in the following 24 hours is doubled; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

  The goldpebble is a stony-scaled water snake that came into existence thanks to a greedy Taldan alchemist of a forgotten time. This ambitious experimenter attempted to create a fecund creature whose body would turn to gold after it died, ensuring an endless supply of wealth with little effort. She found a water snake that bred in shallow pools and produced dozens of offspring, and its biology responded well to her initial tests. The original snake's scales contained trace amounts of minerals and served as a clever camouflage in the wild, and the alchemist combined magical techniques with selective breeding to coax the species' scales into naturally producing nuggets of gold.

   At first, the experiment seemed to be going well; early generations demonstrated traces of gold in their scales, and as they sloughed away their skin with age, the cast-off scales contained enough gold to justify the alchemist's efforts. However, the snakes grew in size with each generation, and soon the breeding pools the alchemist had created could not contain them. Worse, the amount of gold each snake produced didn't increase, but rather seemed to decrease until only glittering flakes remained.

   Frustrated, the alchemist redoubled her efforts and saturated the breeding pools with transmutative alchemical reagents, mercilessly culling any snakes that failed to produce new growth. While this did little to increase the mineral content of the creatures' scales, it did invest them with a supernatural venom that causes victims' blood to slowly turn to water. When the overzealous alchemist next came to harvest her treasured pets, the goldpebbles struck, killing her and escaping into a nearby stream; they can now be found all across the Inner Sea region.

   A fully grown goldpebble is about 12 feet long and weighs 250 pounds.

##### Description

The _goldpebble_ is a stony-scaled water snake that came into existence thanks to a greedy Taldan _[[classes/Alchemist|alchemist]]_ of a forgotten time. This ambitious experimenter attempted to create a fecund creature whose body would turn to gold after it died, ensuring an endless supply of wealth with little effort. She found a water snake that bred in shallow pools and produced dozens of offspring, and its biology responded well to her initial tests. The original snake's scales contained trace amounts of minerals and served as a clever camouflage in the wild, and the _alchemist_ combined magical techniques with selective breeding to coax the species' scales into naturally producing nuggets of gold.

At first, the experiment seemed to be going well; early generations demonstrated traces of gold in their scales, and as they sloughed away their skin with age, the cast-off scales contained enough gold to justify the _alchemist_'s efforts. However, the snakes grew in size with each generation, and soon the breeding pools the _alchemist_ had created could not contain them. Worse, the amount of gold each snake produced didn't increase, but rather seemed to decrease until only glittering flakes remained.

Frustrated, the _alchemist_ redoubled her efforts and saturated the breeding pools with transmutative alchemical reagents, mercilessly _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Culling|culling]]_ any snakes that failed to produce new growth. While this did little to increase the mineral content of the creatures' scales, it did invest them with a supernatural venom that causes victims' blood to slowly turn to water. When the overzealous _alchemist_ next came to harvest her treasured pets, the goldpebbles struck, killing her and escaping into a nearby stream; they can now be found all across the Inner Sea region.

A fully grown _goldpebble_ is about 12 feet long and weighs 250 pounds.
