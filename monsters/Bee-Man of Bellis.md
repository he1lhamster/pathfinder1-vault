special_abilities:
  Apian Emissaries (Sp): The Bee-Man can use bees to duplicate the effect of pryings
    eye or whispering wind at will (caster level 13th). A successful DC 15 Perception
    check identifies the presence of the bees that act as the sensors for these spells,
    but a DC 20 Knowledge (nature) check is required to realize they are behaving
    under outside influence.
  Poison (Ex): Type injury (slam); save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds;
    effect 1d4 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  Swarmlike (Ex): The Bee-Man exists as a hive mind controlling a body of swarming
    bees. He is immune to any physical spell or effect that targets a specific number
    of creatures (including single-target spells). This immunity doesn't apply to
    spells and effects generated by the Bee-Man himself, nor to mind-affecting effects
    that target single creatures. The Bee-Man takes half again as much damage (+50%)
    from damaging area effects. He is also susceptible to high winds and is treated
    as a Diminutive creature for the purposes of determining wind effects. The Bee-Man
    can be targeted by spells as if he were a creature of the vermin type.
  Taboo Name (Su): Whenever the Bee-Man's full name (Vernon Vestha) is spoken within
    13 miles, he hears it as if using clairaudience/clairvoyance. He also learns the
    speaker's direction and distance.
desc_long: Vernon Vestha was a forest oracle obsessed with bees, reading the future
  in the patterns of their flight. Driven mad by a desire to internalize the bees'
  powers of divination, he became one with his beloved bees in some honeyed rite.
  Now a living swarm in the rough semblance of a man, Vernon still roams the forests
  near Bellis, and some still seek out the ex-druid's wisdom by calling his name (Knowledge
  [local] DC 20 to know). He often appears when he is called, though he seldom grants
  favors without exacting a terrible price.

Vernon Vestha was a forest _[[classes/Oracle|oracle]]_ obsessed with bees, reading the future in the patterns of their _[[universal monster rules/Flight|flight]]_.
