special_abilities:
  Never Far Behind (Su): A number of times per day equal to its Charisma modifier,
    a feargaunt can teleport to a square adjacent to a creature that is still shaken
    from the feargaunt's nightmare aura or damaged by its tormenting touch. This ability
    functions as greater teleport. This ability functions only if the feargaunt and
    the creature are both in the Dimension of Dreams.
  Nightmare Aura (Su): A feargaunt is cloaked in a 60-foot-radius aura of fear, which
    manifests as darkened shadows, subtle rot, and skewed perspective. The first time
    a creature ends its turn within the aura, it must succeed at a DC 20 Will save
    or be shaken for as long as it stays within the aura and for 1d4 rounds thereafter.
    Creatures within the aura suffering from any fear effect automatically fail Charisma
    checks to attempt impossible feats in a dreamscape (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures
    243). The feargaunt can suppress or reactivate this aura as a swift action. If
    the creature succeeds at the saving throw, it cannot be affected again by the
    aura for another 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The DC is Charisma-based.
  Prideful Defense (Su): A feargaunt gains a deflection bonus to its Armor Class equal
    to its Wisdom modifier, in addition to the deflection bonus an incorporeal creature
    normally receives based on its Charisma modifier.
  Tormenting Touch (Su): A feargaunt's touch is an incorporeal touch attack that deals
    6d6 points of damage and bypasses damage reduction. A creature that is suffering
    from a fear effect and is struck by the feargaunt's tormenting touch also takes
    1d2 points of Charisma bleed damage. This bleed damage can be stopped as normal,
    but also stops when the subject is no longer suffering from a fear effect.
desc_long: |-
  Certain vivid nightmares endure beyond the sleeper's awakening, drawing substance from planar flotsam and deriving purpose from their creators' deepest fears. Shifting their form from moment to moment, these malicious creatures range the Dimension of Dreams, ambushing prey with soul-weakening strikes. Their presence turns dream elements that might otherwise be only frightening into agonizing experiences that can kill their victims. Feargaunts often allow victims to believe they have escaped, only to attack anew from an unexpected direction. The Dimension of Dreams is their home territory, and a feargaunt uses its knowledge of this realm to ensure that no matter how fast or how far victims flee, they can never truly leave the feargaunt behind.

  Anywhere a feargaunt steps takes on a darker, more frightening cast. Shadows become impenetrable hiding places for things that lurk out of sight, familiar locations take on ominous twists that lead those who thought they knew their way astray, and comforting faces become masks for monstrous, sadistic enemies. The terror the feargaunt inspires eats away at the mental stability of its victims, ensuring that they can't navigate dreamscapes without tripping themselves up and letting their own imaginations hamper them.

This ability functions as greater teleport. This ability functions only if the _feargaunt_ and the creature are both in the Dimension of Dreams.

**_Nightmare_ Aura (Su)** A _feargaunt_ is cloaked in a 60-foot-radius aura of _fear_, which manifests as darkened shadows, subtle rot, and skewed perspective. The first time a creature ends its turn within the aura, it must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be _shaken_ for as long as it stays within the aura and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. Creatures within the aura suffering from any _fear_ effect automatically fail Charisma checks to attempt impossible feats in a dreamscape (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 243). The _feargaunt_ can suppress or reactivate this aura as a swift action. If the creature succeeds at the saving throw, it cannot be affected again by the aura for another 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting _fear_ effect. The DC is Charisma-based.

**Prideful Defense (Su)** A _feargaunt_ gains a _deflection_ bonus to its Armor Class equal to its Wisdom modifier, in addition to the _deflection_ bonus an _incorporeal_ creature normally receives based on its Charisma modifier.

**Tormenting Touch (Su)** A _feargaunt_’s touch is an _incorporeal_ touch attack that deals 6d6 points of damage and bypasses _[[universal monster rules/Damage Reduction|damage reduction]]_.

This _bleed_ damage can be stopped as normal, but also stops when the subject is no longer suffering from a _fear_ effect.

##### Description

Certain vivid nightmares endure beyond the _[[feats/Sleeper|sleeper]]_’s awakening, drawing substance from _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Planar|planar]]_ flotsam and deriving purpose from their creators’ deepest fears. Shifting their form from moment to moment, these malicious creatures range the Dimension of Dreams, ambushing prey with soul-weakening strikes. Their presence turns _[[spells/Dream|dream]]_ elements that might otherwise be only frightening into agonizing experiences that can kill their victims. Feargaunts often allow victims to believe they have escaped, only to attack anew from an unexpected direction. The Dimension of Dreams is their home territory, and a _feargaunt_ uses its knowledge of this realm to ensure that no matter how fast or how far victims flee, they can never truly leave the _feargaunt_ behind.

Anywhere a _feargaunt_ steps takes on a darker, more frightening cast. Shadows become impenetrable hiding places for things that lurk _[[spells/Out Of Sight|out of sight]]_, familiar locations take on _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Ominous|ominous]]_ twists that lead those who thought they knew their way astray, and comforting faces become masks for monstrous, sadistic enemies. The terror the _feargaunt_ inspires eats away at the mental stability of its victims, ensuring that they can’t navigate dreamscapes without tripping themselves up and letting their own imaginations hamper them.
