  Trench Mist Symbiosis (Ex): A barrier breaker troop is immune to trench mists' (Pathfinder
    RPG Bestiary 5 250) acid damage. When a barrier breaker troop reaches 0 hit points
    and is destroyed, it bursts violently outwards, and creatures within or adjacent
    to the troop take 4d6 points of acid damage. If any section of this troop is engulfed
    by trench mist when this death burst occurs, the trench mist's fast healing ability
    doubles for 2d6 rounds.
  Vandalism (Ex): A barrier breaker troop ignores the first 5 points of hardness when
    attacking doors, walls, and other barriers. In addition, it deals double its troop
    damage (normally 4d6) against such barriers and unattended objects. When a barrier
    is destroyed with this ability, it explodes and deals an amount of bludgeoning,
    piercing, and slashing damage equal to 1d4 points plus 1 point per point of the
    object's hardness to creatures within 5 feet of the object, including the barrier
    breaker troop.
  Volley (Ex): A barrier breaker troop can hurl a barrage of rocks and debris as a
    standard action. This attack takes the form of up to two lines with a range of
    40 feet. These lines can each start from any square the troop occupies. Creatures
    in these lines take 2d8 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 17 half). The
    save DC is Dexterity-based.
desc_long: Barrier breaker troops arise from the animation of largenumbers of juju
  zombies in a small amount of time.
