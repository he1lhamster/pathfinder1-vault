### Special Abilities

**Repartee (Su)** Three times per day, when a _[[monsters/Liminal Sprite|liminal sprite]]_

successfully aids another creature’s Charisma-based skill

check, the creature gains a +2d4 bonus on the skill check

instead of the normal +2 bonus. A creature can receive this

bonus from only one _liminal sprite_ per skill check.

**Versatile Performance (Ex)** A _liminal sprite_ can use its bonus

for Perform (comedy) in place of its bonus for Bluff and

Intimidate. When substituting in this way, the _liminal sprite_

uses its total bonus for Perform (comedy), including any

class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill’s total bonus,

whether or not it has ranks in Perform (comedy) or Perform

(comedy) is a class skill for the _[[monsters/Sprite|sprite]]_.

##### Description

An ancestral curse hangs over liminal sprites that prevents

them from sleeping either inside a building or outside in

the open. Fortunately for these sprites, a loophole exists

that allows them to find rest within the external features

of a building. As a result, liminal sprites make their homes

under eaves, porches, and staircases.

Liminal sprites are _[[conditions/Fascinated|fascinated]]_ by the arts, philosophy,

and social intrigues of humanoids, which they experience

vicariously from their hiding places, and with which they

are often moved to interfere. They use their magic to bind

the _[[spells/Tongues|tongues]]_ of the witty and steal thoughts from the wise,

returning them only after the moment in which they would

have been useful has passed, thus adding insult to injury.

The sprites must be subtle, however, lest their unwitting

hosts turn against them. They especially _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ domestic

animals turned loose near their hideaways. On the other

hand, a homeowner who appeases the _sprite_ with f lattery

and gifts finds his own eloquence improved. A 7th-level

chaotic spellcaster can gain a _liminal sprite_ as a familiar

with the _[[feats/Improved Familiar|Improved Familiar]]_ feat, though she must take

pains to find her familiar a suitable place to rest each night.

Liminal sprites stand 1 to 1-1/2 feet tall, and their

mothlike wings stretch to a similar distance. Liminal

sprites follow the local fashions of their city, modeling

their clothes after those worn by nobles and celebrities.
