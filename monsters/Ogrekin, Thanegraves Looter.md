  A new threat wanders Irrisen, the Land of Eternal Winter: the incredibly strong and profoundly durable spawn of ice trolls and ogres in the Thanegraves of Wintercrux. Born when the boreal ogre clans of the region began to take consorts from neighboring troll families, this new breed of giant is rejected and hunted by both its parent races. Most keep to the thanes' tombs, plundering from the dead whatever coins and long-preserved meat they can find. But raids from both boreal ogres and ice trolls regularly force the looters out from the Thanegraves and down into settled valleys, making the creatures desperate for food, living space, and someone smaller than themselves to abuse. Now all across Wintercrux and the Verge, half-ogres threaten travelers and townsfolk. Thanegraves looters brazenly lope down from the mountains to raid settlements or waylay caravans, threatening the delicate balance of power between human subjects and their monstrous rulers.

  Whether because of their desperation for food or bitter rejection of their ogre heritage, Thanegraves looters stand out for their willingness to feed on undead flesh. While the boreal ogres of the region fight to control the burial site's wights and zombies, looters feast on these fetid walking corpses, depriving the ogres of their undead minions, but suffering from the plagues that run rampant through the area as a result. Despite their legendary durability, few of these half-breeds appear healthy or live long past adulthood. Their racial maladies are severe enough that worship of Urgathoa has begun to spring up among them, foreshadowing the birth of strange cults, even by Irrisen's standards.

  Small clans of these half-trolls thrive in the mountains and plains, overcoming their meager numbers through fearsome power and absolute lack of fear-every Thanegraves looter is born to die, by their estimation. Many travelers in Irrisen claim to have witnessed entire hillsides awash with blood from these creatures' raids, but never with bodies left behind. Everything from these clashes is salvaged, though the looters' frames and hands are generally too large and clumsy to use much of human equipment beyond decorative baubles.

##### Description

A new threat wanders Irrisen, the Land of Eternal Winter: the incredibly strong and profoundly durable spawn of ice trolls and ogres in the Thanegraves of Wintercrux. Born when the boreal _[[monsters/Ogre|ogre]]_ clans of the region began to take consorts from neighboring _troll_ families, this new breed of giant is rejected and hunted by both its parent races. Most keep to the thanes’ tombs, plundering from the dead whatever coins and long-preserved meat they can find. But raids from both boreal ogres and ice trolls regularly force the looters out from the Thanegraves and down into settled valleys, making the creatures desperate for food, living space, and someone smaller than themselves to abuse. Now all across Wintercrux and the Verge, half-ogres threaten travelers and townsfolk. Thanegraves looters brazenly lope down from the mountains to raid settlements or waylay caravans, threatening the delicate balance of power between human subjects and their monstrous rulers.

Whether because of their desperation for food or _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Bitter|bitter]]_ rejection of their _ogre_ heritage, Thanegraves looters stand out for their willingness to feed on undead flesh. While the boreal ogres of the region fight to control the burial site’s wights and zombies, looters feast on these fetid walking corpses, depriving the ogres of their undead minions, but suffering from the plagues that run rampant through the area as a result. Despite their legendary durability, few of these half-breeds appear healthy or live long past adulthood. Their racial maladies are severe enough that worship of Urgathoa has begun to spring up among them, foreshadowing the birth of strange cults, even by Irrisen’s standards.

Small clans of these half-trolls thrive in the mountains and plains, overcoming their meager numbers through fearsome power and absolute lack of _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_—every Thanegraves looter is born to die, by their estimation. Many travelers in Irrisen claim to have witnessed entire hillsides awash with blood from these creatures’ raids, but never with bodies left behind. Everything from these clashes is salvaged, though the looters’ frames and hands are generally too large and clumsy to use much of human equipment beyond decorative baubles.
