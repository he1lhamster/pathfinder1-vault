  Harmony with the Land (Su): A basavan is at peace in its natural habitat, and the
    terrain reveals its secrets to the basavan. A basavan in forest terrain gains
    the greensight universal monster rule with a range of 60 feet. When in hill or
    mountain terrain, the basavan gains tremorsense with a range of 60 feet.
  Wilderness Walker (Su): A basavan instinctively knows the easiest and fastest way
    through any wilderness, and always treats trackless terrain as though it were
    a trail or road, and any terrain with a road or trail as though it were a highway.
    In addition, Knowledge (nature) is a class skill for basavans.
desc_long: |-
  Covered in shaggy hair that envelops the entirety of their immense bodies other than their faces, basavans resemble exceptionally hirsute giants. Wise and peaceful stewards of the wilderness, basavans protect the plants and animals that share their homes in wooded mountains across Golarion. Basavans are likely to let unwitting trespassers off with a warning, but against predators and poachers they deal powerful blows with staves and stones, using their innate connection to the land to locate and trap their foes.

   Basavans are 24 feet tall and weigh 17,000 pounds.
