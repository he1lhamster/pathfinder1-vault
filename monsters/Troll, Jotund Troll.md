  All-Seeing Attacks (Ex): A jotund troll can make nine additional attacks of opportunity
    in a round, one for each head, although no more than a single attack for any given
    opportunity.
  Cacophonous Roar (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a jotund troll
    can emit a cacophonous roar from its nine heads. All creatures within a 60-foot
    spread of the troll must make a DC 20 Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds.
    This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a
    +4 racial bonus.
  Multiple Minds (Ex): A jotund troll has nine different minds that are in constant
    communication with each other. The resulting jumble of tangled thoughts grants
    the troll a +4 racial bonus on all Will saving throws against mind-affecting effects.
    In addition, whenever a jotund troll must make a Will save, it can roll the saving
    throw twice and take the better of the two results as its actual saving throw.
desc_long: |-
  Jotund trolls are gigantic, nine-headed horrors. Prowling frigid moors and marshes, these rapacious creatures have the same insatiable appetites of common trolls but require much more sustenance because of their excessive size. Jotund trolls stand 30 feet tall and weigh roughly 25,000 pounds. They can live for up to 100 years.

  The jotund troll's nine heads each have their own brains and senses, but they share, after a fashion, the same mind. Despite this, a jotund troll's heads often argue and bicker, particularly over which head gets to eat. The fact that all nine maws lead to the same shared stomach makes little difference in such culinary disagreements.

  Jotund trolls spawn with either their own kind or with other trolls. In the latter case, there is only a 5% chance the offspring will be a jotund troll. Apart from brief mating periods, jotund trolls are solitary, although some cull together bands of other giants into devastating war parties that can lay waste to entire regions.

##### Description

Jotund trolls are gigantic, nine-headed horrors. Prowling frigid moors and marshes, these rapacious creatures have the same insatiable appetites of common trolls but require much more sustenance because of their excessive size. Jotund trolls stand 30 feet tall and weigh roughly 25,000 pounds. They can live for up to 100 years.

The jotund _troll_’s nine heads each have their own brains and senses, but they share, after a fashion, the same mind. Despite this, a jotund _troll_’s heads often argue and bicker, particularly over which head gets to eat. The fact that all nine maws lead to the same shared stomach makes little difference in such culinary disagreements.

Jotund trolls spawn with either their own kind or with other trolls. In the latter case, there is only a 5% chance the offspring will be a jotund _troll_. Apart from brief mating periods, jotund trolls are solitary, although some cull together bands of other giants into devastating war parties that can lay waste to entire regions.
