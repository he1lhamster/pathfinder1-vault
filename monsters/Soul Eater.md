special_abilities:
  Caster Link (Ex): When a soul eater is summoned, it creates a mental link between
    itself and its conjurer. If the soul eater's assigned target (see find target
    ability) dies before the soul eater can drain its soul, or if the soul eater is
    defeated by its target (but not slain), it returns to its conjurer at full speed
    and attacks her. While the soul eater and the conjurer are on the same plane (regardless
    of plane-traveling interruptions), it can use its find target ability to locate
    its conjurer.
  Find Target (Su): When a soul eater's conjurer orders it to find a creature, it
    can do so unerringly, as though guided by a locate creature spell that has no
    maximum range and is not blocked by running water. The conjurer must have seen
    the desired target and must speak the target's name.
  Soul Drain (Su): If the Wisdom damage from a soul eater's claw attacks equals or
    exceeds an opponent's actual Wisdom score, rendering the victim helpless, the
    soul eater can devour that creature's soul as a standard action that provokes
    an attack of opportunity. This attack kills the victim. The dead victim can resist
    having her soul eaten by making a (DC 17) Fortitude save; success means she is
    still dead, but can be restored to life normally. If she fails this save, her
    soul is consumed by the soul eater. A victim slain in this manner cannot be returned
    to life with clone, raise dead, or reincarnation. She can be restored to life
    via resurrection, true resurrection, miracle, or wish, but only if the caster
    can succeed on a DC 30 caster level check. If the soul eater is killed within
    120 feet of its victim's corpse, and the victim has been dead for no longer than
    1 minute, the victim's soul returns to her body and restores her to life, leaving
    her unconscious and at -1 hit point. This is a death effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Wisdom Damage (Su): A creature hit by a soul eater's claw must succeed on a DC 17
    Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
desc_long: Summoned forth from the inky swamps of Abaddon, a soul eater is an extraplanar
  entity devoid of emotion or reason and possessing a hunger that may only be sated
  by devouring the souls of the living. The very nature of a soul eater makes it an
  ideal and terrifyingly efficient tool of death, and it is for this reason they are
  often conjured by vile spellcasters pursuing morbid agendas. Even when not seeing
  to the heinous commands of a sinister magic user, the soul eater prowls and hunts,
  constantly seeking living souls upon which to gorge itself.

##### Description

Summoned forth from the inky swamps of Abaddon, a _soul eater_ is an extraplanar entity devoid of emotion or reason and possessing a hunger that may only be sated by devouring the souls of the living. The very nature of a _soul eater_ makes it an ideal and terrifyingly efficient tool of death, and it is for this reason they are often conjured by vile spellcasters pursuing morbid agendas. Even when not seeing to the heinous commands of a sinister magic user, the _soul eater_ prowls and hunts, constantly seeking living souls upon which to gorge itself.
