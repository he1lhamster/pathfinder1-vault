  Hostile Teleport (Sp): As a standard action, a pixie circle can attempt to teleport
    a creature within 60 feet that has taken at least 1 point of Constitution damage
    from the pixie circle's withering ability. The target creature is instantly transported
    to the location of another random pixie circle within 1,000 miles. If there is
    no eligible pixie circle within range, the effect fails. A creature can resist
    being teleported with a successful DC 15 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Withering (Ex): A creature damaged by a pixie circle's vines must succeed at a DC
    19 Fortitude save or take 1 point of Constitution damage. A creature's speed is
    reduced by 5 feet for every 2 points of Constitution damage it takes in this way,
    to a minimum speed of 5 feet. Curing any of this Constitution damage restores
    a creature's movement to its full speed. This is a poison effect. The save DC
    is Constitution-based.
desc_long: The pixie circle is an aggressive invasive species that opportunistically
  drains energy from nearby plant and animal life to fuel its teleporting abilities.
  It uses these abilities to remove potential threats from its habitat, typically
  teleporting creatures away when it is threatened or hurt. These sturdy vines are
  resistant to heat, cold, and drought conditions, and an infestation is notoriously
  difficult to root out once it has taken hold. A mature pixie circle measures 20
  feet in diameter and is always in flower regardless of the season.
