**Organization** solitary or pair
**Treasure** none

### Special Abilities

**_Compression_ (Ex)** A _[[monsters/Tizheruk|tizheruk]]_ can

use its _compression_ ability to

remain in waterways as shallow

as 8 inches deep. While compressing

itself against the floor of a body of water,

a _tizheruk_ gains a +4 circumstance bonus on

Stealth checks.
**See-Through Skin (Ex)** Because so much of a _tizheruk_’s body

is transparent, a creature swallowed whole by it has line

of sight to creatures outside the _tizheruk_, and

creatures outside the _tizheruk_ can see any

creatures that were swallowed whole.

**Tongue (Ex)** A _tizheruk_’s tongue is a primary

attack with a reach equal to double the

_tizheruk_’s normal reach (20 feet for a Large

_tizheruk_). A _tizheruk_’s tongue deals no

damage on a hit, but can be used to _grab_ a

creature and _pull_ it closer. A _tizheruk_ does not

gain the _[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ condition while using its tongue

in this manner.

##### Description

The _tizheruk_ is a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_ freshwater predator that wreaks

havoc in the lakes and rivers it inhabits. To make matters

worse, tizheruks also frequently travel inland via smaller

streams where animals and humanoids might think

themselves safe. When a _tizheruk_ swims upstream in such

waters, it naturally compresses its muscles and organs,

enabling it to remain in water less than a foot deep. It

explodes to its full size as soon as it attacks, swallowing

smaller prey or dragging larger creatures into the water

before swimming away with its meal, crushing and

potentially drowning its victim.

Though tizheruks subsist mostly on aquatic prey, they

often supplement their diets with creatures caught on the

shore, particularly sizable mammals such as deer or wild

boars. To capture such creatures, a _tizheruk_ extends its

tightly coiled, whiplike tongue to _[[spells/Snare|snare]]_ one of its prey’s

legs, then retracts the appendage to _pull_ the creature to its

mouth, where it can seize the creature and drag its prey

into the water.

A _tizheruk_’s skin is nearly transparent, granting it

natural camouf lage beneath the water, where its rustcolored

organs and tissue can easily be mistaken for

the bed of a creek or stream. After gorging itself on

fish or on land animals that wander near the shore, the

_tizheruk_ compresses itself on the bottom of a lake or river

while it slowly digests its prey. Until then, its stealth is

compromised, as the ragged chunks of f lesh within

its gullet are clearly visible, even if the _tizheruk_ itself

remains _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Unseen|unseen]]_.

An adult _tizheruk_ is 15 feet long and weighs 200 pounds,

though a _tizheruk_ that has just fed may weigh up to two

or three times as much. Larger tizheruks with the giant

template are threats to even bigger prey.
