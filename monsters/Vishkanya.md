  Poison Use (Ex): Vishkanyas are skilled with poison and never accidentally poison
    themselves when using or applying poison.
  Toxic (Ex): |-
    A number of times per day equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1/day), a vishkanya can envenom a weapon that it wields with its toxic saliva or blood (using blood requires the vishkanya to be injured when it uses this ability). Applying venom in this way is a swift action.

    Vishkanya Venom: Injury; save Fort DC 10 + 1/2 the vishkanya's Hit Dice + the vishkanya's Constitution modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex; cure 1 save.

  Vishkanyas are a race of exotic humanoids known for their guile and affinity for poisons of all kinds. A vishkanya's flesh is made up of fine scales that from a distance of even a few feet look just like particularly smooth skin. These scales are usually a single dark color, although some of them have complex patterns like stripes or even spirals. A vishkanya's tongue is forked like a serpent's tongue, and its eyes lack visible pupils.

  Although legends abound that the merest touch from a vishkanya can slay a mortal humanoid, these tales are patently false. A vishkanya's skin is no more poisonous than that of any human, but it is true that their blood, spit, and other bodily fluids can be dangerous. Vishkanyas are skilled in using their own spittle or even their blood to envenom their weapons, and those who fight them should be wary of exposure to the vishkanya's poison. A vishkanya is 6 feet tall and weighs 130 pounds.

##### Description

Vishkanyas are a race of exotic humanoids known for their guile and affinity for poisons of all kinds. A _vishkanya_’s flesh is made up of fine scales that from a distance of even a few feet look just like particularly smooth skin. These scales are usually a single dark color, although some of them have complex patterns like stripes or even spirals. A _vishkanya_’s tongue is forked like a serpent’s tongue, and its eyes lack visible pupils.

Although legends abound that the merest touch from a _vishkanya_ can slay a mortal humanoid, these tales are patently false. A _vishkanya_’s skin is no more poisonous than that of any human, but it is true that their blood, spit, and other bodily fluids can be dangerous. Vishkanyas are skilled in using their own spittle or even their blood to envenom their weapons, and those who fight them should be wary of exposure to the _vishkanya_’s poison.
