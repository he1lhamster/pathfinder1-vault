### Special Abilities

**Whelp Family (Su)** A su always carries 3–6 (1d4+2) Diminutive

infant su on its back that share a _[[spells/Telepathic Bond|telepathic bond]]_ with their

parent, acting as extra eyes for the adult. Area effects

target the su and not its whelps, but individual whelps can

be targeted with attacks (AC 18; 4 hp). If the su dies, its

whelps die as well. A _[[conditions/Helpless|helpless]]_ su’s whelps can

be easily killed or removed from

the su (removing them

from the su also

immediately kills

them). If all of

a su’s whelps

are slain, the su

immediately loses its _all-around vision_ and improved evasion

and is _[[conditions/Sickened|sickened]]_ until it regains at least one new whelp. A su

replaces lost whelps at a rate of one whelp per week.

**_Prehensile_ Tail (Ex)** A su can use its tail to attempt a dirty

trick, disarm, steal, or _trip_ combat maneuver against an

adjacent opponent as a swift action that does not provoke an

attack of opportunity.

**Whelp Magic (Sp)** Su whelps possess _[[classes/Psychic|psychic]]_ powers that fade

with age. As a swift action, a su can _[[spells/Command|command]]_ one of its

whelps to activate a _psychic_ spell using the _psychic magic_

special ability. A whelp can also maintain concentration on a

spell, provided the su spends a swift action. Any spells that

grant bonuses to their target apply to the su as well as its

whelps. The whelps have a pool of 3 PE per whelp, and each

time a whelp dies the remaining pool reduces by 3. A su

with no whelps can’t use _psychic magic_.

##### Description

Hateful and melancholic, the _psychic_ marsupials _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ su

can feel their minds weaken as they mature, and take out

their frustration on any creatures who enter their forests.

All su bear young. After mating, they implant each other’s

back-pouches with oily, tumor-like eggs which hatch over

the next year into tiny, psychically gifted humanoids. These

young su cling to their parents’ backs, feeding on parasites

and scraps. Born at the apex of their _psychic_ abilities, baby

su slowly _[[universal monster rules/Change Shape|change shape]]_ and lose their powers over their first

year—by the time they reach their full predatory form, all

_psychic magic_ has vanished. These _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Furious|furious]]_ new adults then

leave to become providers for

their own whelps. A grown su is

5 feet long and 90 pounds.
