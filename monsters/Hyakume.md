  Drain Memory (Su): Once per day as a standard action, a hyakume can make a touch
    attack with either its hands or one of its eye probes to drain a target of its
    memories. The target loses the majority of memories relating to life and identity,
    and the hyakume can control the creature as if it were subject to a charm monster
    spell until those memories are regained (Will DC 28 negates). The hyakume absorbs
    the memories and can store and use them. It can store the memories of a number
    of creatures equal to its Intelligence bonus (typically 4) at one time. This is
    a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Eye Probe (Su): Once per day as a full-round action, a hyakume can detach up to
    six of its eyes and send them on missions. An eyeball has AC 22, hp 5, and a fly
    speed of 60 ft. with perfect maneuverability. A hyakume can see through all of
    its eye probes, and can make drain memory attacks with them. If a hyakume's eyeball
    is destroyed, the hyakume takes 5 points of damage. An eye probe can't stray farther
    than 1 mile from a hyakume or the eye is destroyed (dealing 5 points of damage).
  Monk Abilities: The hyakume's Stunning Fist feat and slam attacks function as though
    it were a 15th-level monk. It can also use the quivering palm class feature once
    per day (Fortitude DC 25). The save DC is Wisdom-based.
  Transfer Memories (Su): Once per day as a standard action, a hyakume can touch a
    willing creature with either its hand or one of its eye probes to transfer memories
    it has stored to the creature touched. This is a mind-affecting effect.
desc_long: Hideous and corpulent, with numerous eyes dotting their bodies, hyakumes
  are mystics of malevolence. They steal and collect the memories of other intelligent
  beings to increase their own knowledge.
