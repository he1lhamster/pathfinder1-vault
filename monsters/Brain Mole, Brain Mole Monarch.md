special_abilities:
  Brain Exchange (Su): Whenever a brain mole monarch successfully deals damage to
    a creature to which it is attached, it can switch that creature's mind with one
    of its minions', using its psychic gestalt as a conduit. This ability functions
    as the mind swap spell (Will DC 17 negates), except the brain mole monarch exchanges
    the creature's mind with one of the other brain moles in its psychic gestalt,
    not its own.
  Monarch Bite (Ex): Whenever a brain mole monarch hits with its bite attack, it automatically
    grapples its foe. It automatically succeeds at any checks to maintain the grapple
    in future rounds, and inflicts its bite damage each time it does so. A brain mole
    monarch treats its CMD as 8 higher for the purposes of determining how hard it
    is to break free of the grapple while it is attached.
  Psychic Gestalt (Su): As a full-round action, a brain mole monarch can form a psychic
    link with other brain moles within 100 feet, sharing its intellect and gaining
    the ability to telepathically communicate with and command them. Once the bond
    is established, members can move further than 100 feet from the brain mole monarch
    without breaking it, but it ends if they travel to different planes. Brain moles
    within a psychic gestalt gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Intelligence and gain
    access to the brain mole monarch's teamwork feats. Brain mole monarchs gain a
    cumulative +1 enhancement bonus to Intelligence and 2 PE for each brain mole in
    the gestalt, to a maximum of +6 to Intelligence and 20 additional PE. If any member
    of the gestalt is aware of a particular danger, they are all aware of that danger.
    If one member of the gestalt is not flat-footed, none of them are. No member of
    the gestalt is considered flanked unless all its members are flanked. A brain
    mole can be in only one psychic gestalt, and a brain mole monarch can't be in
    a gestalt with another brain mole monarch.
  Second Sight (Su): Brain mole monarchs can notice and locate any creature capable
    of casting spells (whether arcane, divine, or psychic) within 60 feet. This functions
    identically to thoughtsense, except that it applies only to spellcasting creatures.
  Shrouded Mind (Su): Brain mole monarchs psychically shield their minds to protect
    them from psychic predators. Brain mole monarchs and all members of their gestalts
    are immune to detect spells as well as spells that read or examine auras.
desc_long: Brain moles who gorge themselves on psychic energy occasionally find their
  bodies wracked by magically infused tumors that vastly enhance their intellects
  and psychic spellcasting but condemn the moles to slow deaths. These individuals,
  called brain mole monarchs, connect to their fellow brain moles in a psychic hive
  mind. Most use their newfound mental abilities to attempt to secure a legacy or
  to provide for their nests once they pass on, and their mad plots become increasingly
  eccentric and aggressive as the end nears.
