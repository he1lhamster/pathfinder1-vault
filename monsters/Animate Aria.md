  Aura of Courageous Inspiration (Su): An animate aria continually emanates a rousing
    song to bolster its allies (typically the construct's creator and any creatures
    designated as allies by the construct's creator). Allies within 90 feet of the
    animate aria that can hear its music receive a +1 morale bonus on saving throws
    against charm and fear effects and a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and weapon
    damage rolls. As a standard action, the animate aria can increase these bonuses
    by 2 for 1 round. The aura of courageous inspiration is a mind-affecting effect-as
    a construct, the animate aria is immune to mind-affecting effects, and therefore
    does not receive the bonuses of its own aura. This ability is constant and cannot
    be suppressed by the animate aria.
  Dissonance (Ex): As creatures of sound, animate arias are particularly vulnerable
    to sonic effects. A bard who succeeds at a DC 25 Perform check while using his
    countersong ability negates the animate aria's aura of courageous inspiration
    and natural invisibility abilities (making it appear as a humanoid-shaped cloud
    of prismatic color). In addition, an animate aria in the area of a silence spell
    or effect takes 2d6 points of damage each round.
  Natural Invisibility (Ex): Although an animate aria remains invisible whenever this
    ability is not suppressed, even when attacking, its constant song allows other
    creatures to pinpoint its location. Any creature within 30 feet of the animate
    aria that can hear automatically identifies the squares containing the animate
    aria. Because an animate aria's invisibility is inherent, it is not subject to
    the invisibility purge spell.
desc_long: An animate aria is a piece of operatic music, either vocal or instrumental,
  magically solidified into a humanshaped form roughly 12 feet tall. A creature of
  sound, the animated music is invisible but emanates the inspiring work performed
  during the creature's musical creation.

### Special Abilities

**Aura of _Courageous_ Inspiration (Su)** An _[[monsters/Animate Aria|animate aria]]_ continually emanates a rousing song to bolster its allies (typically the construct’s creator and any creatures designated as allies by the construct’s creator). Allies within 90 feet of the _animate aria_ that can hear its music receive a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and _[[universal monster rules/Fear|fear]]_ effects and a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. As a standard action, the _animate aria_ can increase these bonuses by 2 for 1 round. The aura of _courageous_ inspiration is a mind-affecting effect—as a construct, the _animate aria_ is immune to mind-affecting effects, and therefore does not receive the bonuses of its own aura. This ability is constant and cannot be suppressed by the _animate aria_.

**Dissonance (Ex)** As creatures of sound, animate arias are particularly vulnerable to sonic effects. A _[[classes/Bard|bard]]_ who succeeds at a DC 25 Perform check while using his countersong ability negates the _animate aria_’s aura of _courageous_ inspiration and _natural invisibility_ abilities (making it appear as a humanoid-shaped cloud of prismatic color). In addition, an _animate aria_ in the area of a _[[spells/Silence|silence]]_ spell or effect takes 2d6 points of damage each round.

**_Natural Invisibility_ (Ex)** Although an _animate aria_ remains _[[conditions/Invisible|invisible]]_ whenever this ability is not suppressed, even when attacking, its constant song allows other creatures to pinpoint its location. Any creature within 30 feet of the _animate aria_ that can hear automatically identifies the squares containing the _animate aria_. Because an _animate aria_’s _[[spells/Invisibility|invisibility]]_ is inherent, it is not subject to the _[[spells/Invisibility Purge|invisibility purge]]_ spell.

##### Description

An _animate aria_ is a piece of operatic music, either vocal or instrumental, magically solidified into a humanshaped form roughly 12 feet tall. A creature of sound, the _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Animated|animated]]_ music is _invisible_ but emanates the inspiring work performed during the creature’s musical creation.
