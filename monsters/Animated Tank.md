  Inexhaustible Ammo (Su): An animated tank loads and fires its weapons as a normal
    tank, but it telekinetically reloads from a supernaturally endless supply of ammunition.
  Integrated Weaponry (Ex): An animated tank is equipped with three Maxim M1910 machine
    guns (see page 65) and two Hotchkiss 6 pounders (see page 66) built into its body.
    It treats these weapons as natural attacks and not manufactured weapons. It cannot
    make iterative attacks with these weapons. An animated tank has its weapons arranged
    on all sides of its body and can make three machine gun attacks and one Hotchkiss
    6 pounder attack each round. An animated tank's weapons can still be targeted
    by effects that target manufactured weapons (such as magic weapon spells or sunder
    attempts), but cannot easily be harvested for use once the animated tank is destroyed.
    An animated tank is always proficient with its weapons, and its ranged weapons
    do not provoke attacks of opportunity when fired in melee combat.
  Telekinesis (Su): The pickled brain that animates the tank possesses a supernatural
    ability to manipulate its surroundings and reload its armament. The animated tank
    can use telekinesis as a standard action every 1d4 rounds (caster level 16th).
  Vicious Trample (Ex): An animated tank's powerful metal treads deal 6d6+18 points
    of damage on a successful trample.

  The brains of great military commanders and tacticians need not go to waste simply because their mortal bodies have been slain. Preserved in glass vessels, bathed in nutrient fluids, and wired to strange energies and bizarre technologies, these organs are given new life, as their mental talents are preserved and tapped to independently control monstrous war machines. Though the methods, magic, and technology used differ between creators of these hulking engines, incarnations of these creatures typically take the form of captured siege engines and vehicles retrofitted to allow independent control by the pickled brains inside. 

  Animated tanks are perhaps the most dangerous of such animate siege engines. Thought haunted by some, and simply assumed by others to be well-commanded vehicles crewed by crack soldiers, these animated monstrosities are feared and loathed on battlefields across the front. Blessed with incredible armor and the ability to never tire or deplete their stocks of ammunition, these creatures run roughshod over trenches and barricades alike, grinding troops unfortunate enough to fall beneath their tracks to splinters of meat and bone. The tremendous range afforded by their armaments only makes matters worse for those forced to confront the lumbering monstrosities, and finding a weakness within their steel carcasses is nigh impossible. 

  Animated tanks are found in the company of one or more rifle or flamethrower troops; these soldiers are usually either keenly aware of the tank's unique magical animation, or wholly ignorant of its mysterious and taciturn movements as they simply follow their commander's orders without regard to the tank's missing crew. Those hearing the tanks' orders in their own heads, however, instantly realize that something is not quite normal. As animated tanks are built with the armored frames of British Mark IV tanks-a common war wagon on First World War battlefields-few soldiers question the orders of their superiors when tasked with accompanying one of the beasts. Though Mark IV tanks could normally hold a crew of eight, the cabin of an animated tank is filled with strange technological and alchemical devices, allowing only four Medium creatures space to ride inside-that is, if the animated tank agrees to carry passengers. 

  Animated tanks were designed by Viktor Miloslav for use by the Russian Imperial Army, and it is thought that this mad experimentation and blasphemous use of the deceased is what triggered his exile to the cold wastes of Siberia and his imprisonment in the Akuvskaya prison camp. It is ultimately unknown how effective the creations of Viktor Miloslav proved on the battlefields of the Great War, or whether any of the monstrosities survived the war, as their shelled-out carcasses look little different from normal tanks, with the exception of a faint smell of formaldehyde and remnants of broken glass not usually found with tanks of this model. Whether some slumbering beast waits patiently in some forgotten barn or warehouse remains to be seen, or whether brave soldiers have laid this dangerous and blasphemous technology to rest is unknown, but hopefully Viktor Miloslav's mad designs have all been destroyed or lost forever.

##### Description

The brains of great military commanders and tacticians
need not go to waste simply because their mortal bodies
have been slain. Preserved in glass vessels, bathed in
nutrient fluids, and wired to strange energies and bizarre
technologies, these organs are given new life, as their
mental talents are preserved and tapped to independently
control monstrous war machines. Though the methods,
magic, and technology used differ between creators of
these hulking engines, incarnations of these creatures
typically take the form of captured siege engines and
vehicles retrofitted to allow independent control by the
pickled brains inside.

_[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Animated|Animated]]_ tanks are perhaps the most dangerous of such
animate siege engines. Thought haunted by some, and
simply assumed by others to be well-commanded vehicles
crewed by crack soldiers, these _animated_ monstrosities are
feared and loathed on battlefields across the front. _[[feats/Blessed|Blessed]]_
with incredible armor and the ability to never tire or deplete
their stocks of ammunition, these creatures run roughshod
over trenches and barricades alike, _grinding_ troops
unfortunate enough to fall beneath their tracks to splinters
of meat and bone. The tremendous range afforded by their
armaments only makes matters worse for those forced
to confront the lumbering monstrosities, and finding a
weakness within their steel carcasses is nigh impossible.

_Animated_ tanks are found in the company of one or
more _[[items/Weapon/Rifle|rifle]]_ or flamethrower troops; these soldiers are
usually either keenly aware of the tank’s unique magical
animation, or wholly ignorant of its mysterious and taciturn
movements as they simply follow their commander’s
orders without regard to the tank’s missing crew. Those
hearing the tanks’ orders in their own heads, however,
instantly realize that something is not quite normal. As
_animated_ tanks are built with the armored frames of
British Mark IV tanks—a common war wagon on First
World War battlefields—few soldiers question the orders
of their superiors when tasked with accompanying one of
the beasts. Though Mark IV tanks could normally hold a
crew of eight, the cabin of an _animated tank_ is filled with
strange technological and alchemical devices, allowing
only four Medium creatures space to ride inside—that is,
if the _animated tank_ agrees to carry passengers.

_Animated_ tanks were designed by Viktor Miloslav for use
by the Russian Imperial Army, and it is thought that this
mad experimentation and blasphemous use of the deceased
is what triggered his exile to the cold wastes of Siberia and
his _[[spells/Imprisonment|imprisonment]]_ in the Akuvskaya prison camp. It is
ultimately _[[monsters/Unknown|unknown]]_ how effective the creations of Viktor
Miloslav proved on the battlefields of the Great War, or
whether any of the monstrosities survived the war, as their
shelled-out carcasses look little different from normal
tanks, with the exception of a faint smell of formaldehyde
and remnants of _[[conditions/Broken|broken]]_ glass not usually found with
tanks of this model. Whether some slumbering beast waits
patiently in some forgotten barn or warehouse remains to be
seen, or whether brave soldiers have laid this dangerous and
blasphemous technology to rest is _unknown_, but hopefully
Viktor Miloslav’s mad designs have all been destroyed or
lost forever.
