  Blind: A tikoloshe has no eyes and is blind. All creatures beyond the range of its
    hearing-based blindsense and blindsight abilities have total concealment against
    it.
  Trickster's Torment (Su): Once per day, a tikoloshe can curse another living creature.
    As a standard action, the tikoloshe makes a melee touch attack and unless the
    target makes a DC 15 Will save, the target is treated as if under the effect of
    bestow curse, except that the curse's duration is only 24 hours. A creature can
    only suffer from one tikoloshe's curse at a time. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Water Diffusion (Ex): When in water at least 2 feet deep, a tikoloshe's body seems
    to diffuse into and become part of the water, granting it concealment (20% miss
    chance) as if under the effect of blur. This effect ends immediately upon entering
    shallower water or setting foot on land.
  Waverider (Ex): Up to 3 times per day, a tikoloshe can swim up to 30 feet as a swift
    action. It does not provoke an attack of opportunity for this movement.
desc_long: Cruel and spiteful, tikoloshe (singular and plural) are small undead that
  haunt tropical waterways and jungles, preying on travelers and villagers alike with
  their magical abilities and appetite for harm. Tikoloshe stand no higher than a
  gnome or a human child, but their bodies are dense and muscular; many have large
  potbellies and arms long enough for their knuckles to score the dirt as they walk.
  Their creation leaves them with blackened, eyeless sockets, but tikoloshe can “see”
  using their giant, bat-like ears. Their skin is smooth and shines whether wet or
  dry. Tikoloshe are genderless; they stand about 4 feet tall and weigh almost 150
  pounds.
