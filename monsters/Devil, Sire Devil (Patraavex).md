  Caustic Blood (Ex): A patraavex's blood is highly acidic. A creature that deals
    piercing or slashing damage to a sire devil as part of a melee attack with a natural
    weapon or unarmed strike must succeed at a DC 19 Reflex saving throw or take 2d6
    points of acid damage. A creature that deals piercing or slashing damage to a
    sire devil with a melee weapon must succeed at a DC 19 Reflex saving throw or
    the weapon takes 2d6 points of acid damage (objects take full damage from this
    acid); if this damage exceeds the weapon's hardness, the weapon gains the broken
    condition. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Taint Bloodline (Su): As a full-round action, a sire devil can touch a willing,
    living mortal creature and infuse the creature with its infernal power, ensuring
    that all children born to the mortal from then on will be hellspawn tieflings.
    Offspring resulting from unions between sire devils and humanoids are always tieflings;
    patraavexes cannot create half-fiends through procreation.
desc_long: |-
  Patraavexes are the progenitors of many of the Material Plane's tieflings. Seeking mortals who either want hellspawn children or are willing to bear an infernal taint on their bloodlines in exchange for the devil's offerings, a sire devil lives to insinuate hell's influence into the mortal population. Patraavexes use their shapechanging ability as a bargaining chip with potential mates, who put their immediate pleasure above the long-lasting ramifications of corrupting their bloodlines with an infernal taint. Patraavexes may not be completely honest with their targets about the price of their companionship, especially when they hope to introduce tieflings into a population where their appearance would cause a stir. In some cases, sire devils are contracted by mortals to secretly corrupt another person's bloodline, generally as a means of political and social sabotage.

  A typical sire devil is 7 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds.

Patraavexes are the progenitors of many of the Material Plane’s tieflings. Seeking mortals who either want hellspawn children or are willing to bear an infernal taint on their bloodlines in exchange for the devil’s offerings, a sire devil lives to insinuate hell’s influence into the mortal population. Patraavexes use their shapechanging ability as a bargaining chip with potential mates, who put their immediate pleasure above the long-lasting ramifications of corrupting their bloodlines with an infernal taint. Patraavexes may not be completely honest with their targets about the price of their companionship, especially when they hope to introduce tieflings into a population where their appearance would cause a stir. In some cases, sire devils are contracted by mortals to secretly corrupt another person’s bloodline, generally as a means of political and social sabotage.
