##### Description

Moas are large, f lightless birds that, with their necks

outstretched, stand nearly as tall as ogres. They roam

the grasslands feeding

on the thick grasses

and shrubs that are

mostly inedible to

smaller birds and

mammals. While

these birds are

gigantic, they are

rather docile and

skittish, preferring

to f lee than fight.

They can become

aggressive when faced

with predators or perceived

threats to their young or food

sources. In these cases, the larger birds of

a colony or group move forward to protect

the young and weak moas of the f lock.

These larger moas leap into

the air and lash out with both

of their broad, sharp talons to

inf lict grievous wounds.

A full-grown moa can weigh

as much as 500 lbs.
