  Calcifying Touch (Su): An incorporeal ozimat's touch can partially petrify a living
    creature's body, dealing 1d8 points of Dexterity damage. When reduced to 0 Dexterity
    in this way, an affected creature is petrified for 24 hours. A petrified Medium
    creature can serve as a stone receptacle for the ozimat's earthen host ability;
    if used in this manner, it doubles the length of time the ozimat can remain in
    that form.
  Earthen Host (Su): As a full-round action, an ozimat can merge with a body of inert
    earth or stone, shedding its incorporeality. The form must be roughly the size
    of a Medium creature. A merged ozimat loses its incorporeal subtype (plus all
    incorporeal special qualities, including its deflection bonus to AC) and its fly
    speed, but gains a Strength score of 24, a +8 natural armor bonus (AC 24, touch
    16, flat-footed 18), DR 5/-, and Improved Bull Rush and Power Attack as bonus
    feats. In earthen form, an ozimat gains 2 slam attacks with a +23 bonus to hit,
    each dealing 3d6+7 points of damage, but cannot use its calcifying touch. Its
    hit points do not change. An ozimat can maintain its earthen form for a number
    of rounds per day equal to its Hit Dice (typically 16).
desc_long: Earth elementals are useful for the creation of golems, as their stoic
  demeanor ensures the longest lasting bond between body and animate force. When a
  golem is destroyed but the elemental spirit survives, ozimats are the result. Still,
  those that endure the agony of this experience can ascend to become relatively tranquil
  beings.

### Special Abilities

**Calcifying Touch (Su)** An _incorporeal_ _[[monsters/Ozimat|ozimat]]_’s touch can partially petrify a living creature’s body, dealing 1d8 points of Dexterity damage. When reduced to 0 Dexterity in this way, an affected creature is _[[conditions/Petrified|petrified]]_ for 24 hours. A _petrified_ _Medium_ creature can serve as a stone receptacle for the _ozimat_’s earthen host ability; if used in this manner, it doubles the length of time the _ozimat_ can remain in that form.

**Earthen Host (Su)** As a full-round action, an _ozimat_ can merge with a body of inert earth or stone, shedding its incorporeality. The form must be roughly the size of a _Medium_ creature. A merged _ozimat_ loses its _incorporeal_ subtype (plus all _incorporeal_ special qualities, including its _deflection_ bonus to AC) and its fly speed, but gains a Strength score of 24, a +8 natural armor bonus (AC 24, touch 16, _flat-footed_ 18), DR 5/—, and _[[feats/Improved Bull Rush|Improved Bull Rush]]_ and _[[feats/Power Attack|Power Attack]]_ as bonus feats. In earthen form, an _ozimat_ gains 2 slam attacks with a +23 bonus to hit, each dealing 3d6+7 points of damage, but cannot use its calcifying touch. Its hit points do not change. An _ozimat_ can maintain its earthen form for a number of rounds per day equal to its Hit Dice (typically 16).

##### Description

Earth elementals are useful for the creation of golems, as their _[[feats/Stoic|stoic]]_ demeanor ensures the longest lasting bond between body and animate force. When a golem is destroyed but the elemental spirit survives, ozimats are the result. Still, those that endure the agony of this experience can ascend to become relatively tranquil beings.
