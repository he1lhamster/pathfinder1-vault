  Bountiful Fruits (Ex): Once per week, a flowering lattice produces a handful of
    small fruits or berries that remain ripe for 1 week. Eating all of the fruit takes
    1 minute and affects the eater as if she had consumed a berry affected by goodberry.
  Pollen (Ex): Once every 1d4 rounds, a flowering lattice can expel a cloud of pollen
    in a 10-foot cone. Creatures in the area are dazzled for 2 rounds (Fortitude DC
    11 negates). If a creature currently dazzled by the pollen is affected again,
    it is blinded for 1 round (Fortitude DC 11 negates). The save DC is Constitution-based
    and includes a +2 racial bonus.
desc_long: The result of centuries of plant husbandry, flowering lattices are delicate
  networks of vines that form blossoming nets about 1 square foot in size. As many
  as 12 varieties of flower grow from an individual flowering lattice, with each bloom
  opening at different times of the year and hours of the day to ensure a nearly constant
  array of colorful petals. This plant's enthusiasts often incorporate the organism
  into their fashion, draping them over the shoulders like a stole or over the head
  as a hood. These lattices require regular care, surviving on their own only in regions
  with rich soil and ample pollinators.
