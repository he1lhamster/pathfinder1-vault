### Special Abilities

**Absorb Magic (Ex)** When a _[[monsters/Green Man|green man]]_ strikes a creature with his slam attack, he immediately attempts to absorb one magical effect from the target. Treat this as a targeted _dispel magic_ (CL 20th), with the _green man_ preferring to target effects that prevent his vines’ grapple attempts, like _freedom of movement_. When the _green man_ absorbs magic in this way, he regains a number of hit points equal to double the level of the spell effect he absorbed.

**Deific** A _green man_ grants divine spells to worshipers. This does not require any specific action on the _green man_’s behalf. The domains granted by a _green man_ vary according to the _green man_’s alignment. Most green men are neutral and grant access to the domains of Plant, Protection, Strength, and Weather and to the subdomains of Defense, Growth, Resolve, and Seasons. A neutral good _green man_ grants access to the domains of Good, Plant, Protection, and Weather and to the subdomains of Defense, Growth, Purity, and Seasons. A neutral evil _green man_ grants access to the domains of Evil, Plant, Strength, and Weather and to the subdomains of Decay, Growth, Resolve, and Seasons. Regardless of his alignment, a _green man_’s favored weapon is the _[[items/Weapon/Sickle|sickle]]_. If a _druid_ worshiping a _green man_ chooses to take a domain, the _druid_ must choose the Plant domain, regardless of alignment. The _green man_’s holy symbol is that of a masculine face made of leaves, but the exact expression and appearance of the face varies by _green man_, and each is unique in detail.

**_Green Caress_ (Su)** Non-plant living creatures within 60 feet of a _green man_ slowly begin to transform into non-magical plants. Treat this effect as the spell _green caress_, save that the _green man_ need not touch a creature to begin the effect. A creature must attempt a DC 36 Fortitude save against this effect once upon first entering the aura. If successful, that creature partially resists the effect as per the spell description and is immune to that particular _green man_’s aura for 24 hours. On a failed save, the effect persists until the creature transforms or the effect is removed (unlike with the spell, it is not limited to a maximum duration of 7 days). Also unlike the spell, this effect is not contagious, and a spellcaster who attempts to stop this _green caress_ via _[[spells/Break Enchantment|break enchantment]]_, _[[spells/Miracle|miracle]]_, _[[spells/Polymorph Any Object|polymorph any object]]_, _[[spells/Remove Curse|remove curse]]_, or _[[spells/Wish|wish]]_ does not risk becoming targeted by the effect. This aura, being supernatural in nature and not a spell or spell-like ability, cannot be stopped via _dispel magic_. A _green man_ can select creatures to be unaffected by his aura as an immediate action, but he must be aware of them to grant such clemency, and he cannot reverse the effects of the aura once inflicted. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Green _Empathy_ (Ex)** This ability functions as the _druid_’s wild _empathy_, save that the _green man_ can only use this ability on plant creatures. A _green man_’s green _empathy_ check bonus is equal to his HD plus his Charisma modifier (+43 for the typical _green man_).
**_Summon_ Plants (Sp)** Three times per day as a swift action, a _green man_ can _summon_ any combination of plant creatures whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This otherwise works like the _summon_ universal monster rule with a 100% chance of success and counts as a 9th-level spell effect.

**Thorns (Su)** A _green man_’s thorns are ranged touch attacks with a range increment of 120 feet. A creature damaged by a _green man_’s thorn moves at half speed and can’t take 5-foot steps, fly, or use _[[spells/Air Walk|air walk]]_, either naturally or magically, until the target or another creature pulls out the thorn as a full round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

**Vines (Ex)** A _green man_ can extend up to six thorny vines from his body to attack foes. These act as primary natural melee attacks that deal bludgeoning and piercing damage and have a reach of 30 feet.

**Wilderness Insight (Ex)** When in a natural area with foliage present, the plants whisper to the _green man_ and grant him an insight bonus to his AC equal to his Wisdom bonus. This bonus is included in the statistics above, but it is lost in areas where plant life is not present in large quantities (typically the case for desert, underground, or urban locales).

##### Description

Ancient beyond measure, the legendary green men are avatars and guardians of the primeval forest. Green men are the naturally occurring _[[feats/Apotheosis|apotheosis]]_ of such woodland terrains. Most care little for other aspects of nature, from animals to geology, focusing exclusively on the flora of their home forest and the seasonal _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Impact|impact]]_ of weather. They grant spells enthusiastically to intelligent plants that worship them and somewhat more hesitantly to other sentient races who prove themselves friends of plants. Sometimes _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Called|called]]_ “leshy kings” in esoteric texts, the enigmatic green men are said to be the ones who first taught druids the secrets of creating leshies, yet they themselves are far more powerful than these tiny creations.

Most green men keep out of the way of the “animal races” as long as they leave the forest alone, while the rare _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Benevolent|benevolent]]_ and _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Malevolent|malevolent]]_ green men actively spread their influence over their home forests. _Benevolent_ green men are kindly and nurturing patriarchs to all within their domain, even non-plants. Their territories are _[[feats/Blessed|blessed]]_ with beautiful flowers and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Peaceful|peaceful]]_ groves. _Malevolent_ green men are twisted and sadistic bullies, and are fortunately the rarest of these paragons of plant life. Their territories are marred with poisonous plants, thorny vines, and twisted trees. What few animals remain in such regions are either _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_ enough to stand up to their plant tormentors or are allowed to remain to provide sport.
