##### Ecology

**Treasure** incidental

### Special Abilities

**_Freeze_ (Ex)** A _[[monsters/Stranglereed|stranglereed]]_ can hold itself so still that it

appears to be normal vegetation. A _stranglereed_ that

uses this ability can take 20 on its Stealth check to hide

in plain sight as a regular patch of reeds.

**_Grab_ (Ex)** A _stranglereed_ can _grab_ a foe of up to one size

category larger than itself.
**_Strangle_ (Ex)** Stranglereeds have an unerring talent

for seizing their victims by the throat. A creature

_[[conditions/Grappled|grappled]]_ by a _stranglereed_ can’t speak or cast spells

with verbal components.
**Suffocate (Ex)** A creature affected by a _stranglereed_’s

_strangle_ ability can’t breathe and must hold its breath

or suffocate.

##### Description

Stranglereeds f loat motionless in calm lakes and

rivers, waiting for prey to approach before lashing

out with thick tendrils, grabbing their targets by the

throat. Once the _stranglereed_ has secured its prey, it pulls

the victim beneath the surface of the water and directs

the meal into it’s “mouth,” a submerged circular orifice

ringed with gnashing barbs and thorns. Exceptionally

voracious, the _stranglereed_ never stops feeding, and

in desperate times, the industrious plant can leave the

water brief ly in order to hunt on land. These _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Vicious|vicious]]_

plants may even chase slower prey if it breaks free of their

tendrils, but fortunately, a _stranglereed_ can spend only a

limited amount of time out of water. Each _stranglereed_

resembles a patch of normal reeds that covers a roughly

circular 10-foot-diameter area, while its large, mawed

central pod normally hides beneath the water’s surface.

A _stranglereed_ weighs 800 pounds.

A _stranglereed_ reproduces by expelling seeds that f loat

on air currents, much like dandelion f luff. Those that

land on dry earth soon die or become meals for birds and

other small animals, but those that land in water grow into

full-sized _stranglereed_ stalks within 1 month. A large body

of water can be home to multiple stranglereeds, but only if

the food supply can meet their demands.
