  Entropic Breath (Su): Instead of a line of acid, a woundwyrm can exhale a 30-foot
    cone of acid fog (as the spell) that persists for 1 minute. Any creature that
    begins its turn within the entropic breath becomes confused (Will DC 25 negates)
    for as long as it remains within the cloud and for 1d6 rounds thereafter.
  Maw of the Abyss (Su): As a full-round action, a woundwyrm can attempt to suck creatures
    and unattended objects in a 15-foot cone into a vortex in its maw. This acts as
    a drag combat maneuver (CMB +30) against creatures, and acts as a Strength check
    with a +10 bonus to break objects. Unattended objects weighing less than 100 pounds
    are automatically drawn into its maw. Creatures and objects alike take 1d12 points
    of sonic damage per round within the cone. While using this ability, a woundwyrm
    cannot speak, use its breath weapon, or make attacks or attacks of opportunity
    with its bite attack.
desc_long: Woundwyrms are ferocious predators native to the corrupted landscape of
  the Worldwound. They are equally at home in sea and sky, above the ground and below
  it. Oozing deliquescence seeps from between their cracked, rocky scales, and a constant
  fume of rainbow hues drifts out of their gullets, save when they inhale and ingest
  the very substance of disintegrating reality.
