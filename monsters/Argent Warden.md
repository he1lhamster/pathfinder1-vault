  Argent Armor (Ex): A destroyed argent warden can be worn as armor, provided the

    a suit of armor functions as Medium +1 full plate armor for a creature that is
    good-aligned. Non-good creatures treat the armor as nonmagical but masterwork
    full plate.
  Divine Grace (Su): An argent warden gains a bonus equal to its Charisma modifier
    (typically +3) on all saving throws.
  Hellspurning Aura (Su): An argent warden imbues all weapons within 30 feet with
    its silvery essence. All weapons (including natural weapons) in this area are
    treated as if they were magic and silver for the purposes of overcoming damage
    reduction.
desc_long: In Heaven's war against Hell, the argent wardens are always present. Each
  a suit of armor given life in celestial forges, the argent wardens are constructed
  to oppose diabolism.
