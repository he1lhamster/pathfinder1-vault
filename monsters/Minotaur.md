special_abilities:
  Maze Mastery (Su): A mythic minotaur can designate an area no greater than 100 feet
    on a side (typically a maze, underground labyrinth, or other confusing structure)
    as its personal lair. As a move action, the minotaur can teleport from one point
    in its lair to any other point in its lair, as if using greater teleport. In addition,
    whenever the minotaur must make a saving throw while inside its lair, it can roll
    twice and take the higher result. A mythic minotaur can change its lair once per
    week. A minotaur can share its lair with other creatures (including other minotaurs
    or mythic minotaurs) without interfering with this ability.
  Natural Cunning (Ex): Although a mythic minotaur is not especially intelligent,
    it possesses innate cunning and logical ability. This gives it immunity to maze
    spells and prevents it from ever becoming lost. Further, it is never caught flat-footed.
  Oubliette (Su): Whenever a mythic minotaur hits a creature with its gore attack
    as part of a powerful charge, the target must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or
    be sent into an extradimensional prison, as the maze spell but lasting for 1d4+1
    rounds. The save DC is Wisdom-based and includes a +2 racial modifier.
desc_long: A mythic minotaur is but one or two generations removed from the original
  curse-born minotaurs that founded their race. Once created to punish to those who
  disobey or circumvent the orders of the gods, they use their innate magic to imprison,
  stalk, and consume humanoids-especially the descendants of the royal line whose
  blasphemy inspired the creation of this new race. Some mythic minotaurs are worshiped
  as demigods by primitive or fear-stricken humanoids, and accept sacrifices of young
  men and women to sate their hunger. They usually have custom armor and weapons appropriate
  for their large, inhuman frames, offered as gifts by worshipers or made by enslaved
  blacksmiths.

### Special Abilities

**Natural _Cunning_ (Ex)** Although minotaurs are not especially intelligent, they possess innate _cunning_ and logical ability. This gives them _[[universal monster rules/Immunity|immunity]]_ to _[[spells/Maze|maze]]_ spells and prevents them from ever becoming lost. Further, they are never caught _flat-footed_.

##### Description

Nothing holds a grudge like a _[[monsters/Minotaur|minotaur]]_. Scorned by the civilized races centuries ago and born from a deific curse, minotaurs have hunted, slain, and devoured lesser humanoids in _[[spells/Retribution|retribution]]_ for real or imagined slights for as long as anyone can remember. Many cultures have legends of how the first minotaurs were created by vengeful or slighted gods who punished humans by twisting their forms, robbing them of their intellects and beauty, and giving them the heads of bulls. Yet most modern minotaurs hold these legends in contempt and believe that they are not divine mockeries but divine paragons created by a _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Potent|potent]]_ and _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_ demon lord named Baphomet.

The traditional _minotaur_’s lair is a _maze_, be it a legitimate labyrinth constructed to baffle and confuse, an accidental one such as a city sewer system, or a naturally occurring one such as a tangle of caverns and other underground passageways. Employing their innate _cunning_, minotaurs use their _maze_ lairs to vex unwary foes who seek them out or who simply stumble into the lairs and become lost, slowly hunting the intruders as they try in vain to find a way out. Only when despair has truly set in does the _minotaur_ move in to strike at its lost victims. When dealing with a group, minotaurs often let one creature escape, to spread the tale of horror and lure others to their mazes in hope of slaying the beasts. Of course, to minotaurs, these would-be heroes make for delicious meals.

Minotaurs might also be found in the employ of a more powerful monster or evil creature, serving it so long as they can still hunt and dine as they please. Usually this means _[[items/Armor Magic Abilities/Guarding|guarding]]_ some powerful object or valuable location, but it can also be a sort of mercenary work, hunting down the foes of its master.

Minotaurs are relatively straightforward combatants, using their horns to horribly gore the nearest living creature when combat begins.
