special_abilities:
  Bloody-Minded (Ex): A ypotryll is not easily swayed from its bloody business. It
    gains a +6 bonus on saves against charm and compulsion effects.
  Destructive Charge (Ex): A ypotryll's charge attack ignores up to 1 point of a target
    object's hardness for each 5 feet charged.
  Thundering Path (Ex): A ypotryll's charge shakes the ground it crosses. The path
    of its charge is considered difficult terrain until the start of the ypotryll's
    next turn, and creatures with tremorsense that are within 100 feet of the end
    of the ypotryll's charge are blinded for that same amount of time.
  Unstoppable Force (Ex): A ypotryll's bonus on a charge attack is +4, and it may
    add this bonus on overrun combat maneuver checks attempted using Charge Through.
    A ypotryll may charge over difficult terrain, provided the terrain does not cost
    more than 2 squares to enter.
desc_long: |-
  For those unfortunate enough to get in an ypotryll's way, the thundering rhythm of its hooves is the sound of doom. These creatures are pure savagery and destruction incarnate. A bulk of muscle and hate, a charging ypotryll can be slowed by few things. Bodies and viscera are strewed about when this powerful boarlike juggernaut hits a shield wall, and pikes splinter on its armored plates as if they were twigs. Given enough momentum, a charging ypotryll can rip apart a drawbridge or even the crash through a keep's walls. Powerful savage tribes corral these beasts and unleash their carnage on the battlefield. Giants and powerful troll chiefs prize ypotrylls, and spend much time and resources to break them, though ypotrylls' volatile nature ensures such domestication is rare. When it does happen, they make truly frightening steeds.

  In the wild, ypotrylls spend their time roaming their territory looking for enough food to support their massive bodies. While they prefer meat, these creatures are omnivores and will eat almost anything. Ypotrylls are especially fond of the scraps they can find in the trash heaps of civilized races, which can mean disaster for a settlement.

Bodies and viscera are strewed about when this powerful boarlike _[[monsters/Juggernaut|juggernaut]]_ hits a _[[feats/Shield Wall|shield wall]]_, and pikes splinter on its armored plates as if they were twigs.
