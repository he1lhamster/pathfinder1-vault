  Break Bones (Ex): Whenever a yaenit scores a critical hit with its bite attack,
    its opponent must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or have its base speed reduced
    by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet). This penalty remains until the affected creature
    benefits from any amount of magical healing or a successful DC 20 Heal check.
    The save DC is Strength-based.
  Hallucinatory Aura (Su): Any creature coming within 20 feet of a yaenit must succeed
    at a DC 17 Will save or succumb to the demon's foul, mind-warping magic. A creature
    affected by a yaenit's hallucinatory aura takes a -2 penalty on Will saves, caster
    level checks, Intelligence-based skill checks, and Wisdom-based skill checks for
    as long as it remains within the aura's range and for 1d4-1 rounds after leaving
    the area of effect. This is a mind-affecting effect. Whether or not the save is
    successful, an affected creature is immune to the same yaenit's hallucinatory
    aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
desc_long: |-
  Violent progenitors of Lamashtu's earthly broods, the yaenit demons' purpose is to protect Lamashtu's priestesses and their unholy spawn. Yaenits rise from the souls of evil mortals who in life were exceptionally cruel bullies and tormentors. Their resemblance to gnolls is no coincidence, as many yaenits form from the spirits of gnolls in the Abyss. Gnolls, for their part, revere yaenits as embodiments of Lamashtu's will, and worship these demons as representatives of both the Mother of Monsters and her unholy designs for her devoted gnoll followers. 

  Terrifying predators, yaenits' deceptively stooped and gangly physiques belie the 300 pounds of knotted and powerful muscle tied to their solid black bones. A yaenit is 6-1/2 feet tall.

##### Description

Violent progenitors of Lamashtu’s earthly broods, the yaenit demons’ purpose is to protect Lamashtu’s priestesses and their _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Unholy|unholy]]_ spawn. Yaenits rise from the souls of evil mortals who in life were exceptionally _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cruel|cruel]]_ bullies and tormentors. Their resemblance to gnolls is no coincidence, as many yaenits form from the spirits of gnolls in the Abyss. Gnolls, for their part, revere yaenits as embodiments of Lamashtu’s will, and worship these demons as representatives of both the Mother of Monsters and her _unholy_ designs for her devoted _gnoll_ followers.

Terrifying predators, yaenits’ deceptively stooped and gangly physiques belie the 300 pounds of knotted and powerful muscle tied to their solid black bones. A yaenit is 6-1/2 feet tall.
