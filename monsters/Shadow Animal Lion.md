##### Description

Dread energies from the Plane of _Shadow_ have leaked into the countryside of Nidal for thousands of years, pooling in shadowed groves and along darkened hillsides. Although normal animals shun these shadow-haunted regions, hunger or adversity sometimes compels a creature to enter them. Some animals who do so are wholly transformed by these energies, becoming _shadow_ animals.

_Shadow_ animals are more than mere animals, becoming hunters bleached of bright colors and commanding unusual predatory powers. Even herbivores that undergo this _[[spells/Transformation|transformation]]_ become short tempered and dangerous.

_Shadow_ animals have the brute _[[items/Weapon Magic Abilities/Cunning|cunning]]_ to understand spoken language, but they generally cannot speak.
