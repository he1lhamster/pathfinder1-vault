  Infectious Dance (Su): Any creature viewing a dancing maenad from within 60 feet
    of her must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be affected as if by confusion for
    1 hour. For every four creatures affected by this ability, the maenad gains 1d10
    temporary hit points and her Charisma score increases by 1; these benefits end
    if the affected creatures break free of the dance.
  Mad Feast (Su): As a full-round action, a maenad can conjure a supernatural feast.
    Creatures eating from this feast gain a +2 bonus to Strength and Constitution,
    1d8 temporary hit points, and a +4 morale bonus on fear saves for 12 hours. Creatures
    affected also take a -4 penalty on Will saving throws (this penalty does not apply
    on saves against fear), and find it more compelling to engage in debauchery, excess,
    and violence.
  Poison (Ex): Bite-injury; save Fort DC 19; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect
    1d3 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.
desc_long: |-
  Creatures of unbridled violence and decadence, maenads roam the world inviting others to join in on their debased revels. Though they can otherwise pass for humans, maenads appear bestial when raging or engaging in a bloody revel. They consume massive amounts of wine and food, cause fights, and tear their foes limb from limb. They control people's minds, subconsciously inviting them to engage in their bloody festivities and fostering urges that lead to excesses of hunger, lust, anger, and violence.

  Maenads can live for thousands of years. They insinuate themselves into normal society before attempting to inf luence the community. They travel their entire lives in search of creatures to influence into debauchery, cannibalism, and gluttony.

Creatures of unbridled violence and decadence, maenads roam the world inviting others to join in on their debased revels. Though they can otherwise pass for humans, maenads appear bestial when raging or engaging in a bloody revel. They consume massive amounts of wine and food, cause fights, and tear their foes limb from limb. They control people’s minds, subconsciously inviting them to engage in their bloody festivities and fostering urges that lead to excesses of hunger, lust, anger, and violence.

Maenads can live for thousands of years. They insinuate themselves into normal society before attempting to inf luence the community. They travel their entire lives in search of creatures to influence into debauchery, cannibalism, and gluttony.
