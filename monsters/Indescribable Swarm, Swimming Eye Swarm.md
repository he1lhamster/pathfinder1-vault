  Ruptured Membranes (Ex): As a defense mechanism, some members of a swimming eye
    swarm sacrifice themselves by rupturing their outer membranes when unexpected
    creatures enter the swarm's space, splattering the target with gruesome vitreous
    fluid. Any creature entering a space occupied by a swimming eye swarm must succeed
    at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw or be affected by the swarm's poison ability. A
    creature that fails its saving throw against poison administered in this way is
    nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

  The darkest depths of the sea are home to some of the strangest creatures imaginable. At first glance, these creatures appear to be little more than small jellyfish. However, at the heart of each gelatinous mass is a disturbingly human-looking eyeball floating as if suspended in the creature's bodily fluids.

  Like many of their common jellyfish cousins, the creatures in a swimming eye swarm are incredibly poisonous. Their uncanny eyeballs act as poison sacs as well as a sensory organ. These eyes are remarkably fragile, often bursting after even the gentlest jostling. However, a swarm's eyeballs grow back quickly, often in less than a week.

##### Description

The darkest depths of the sea are home to some of the strangest creatures imaginable. At first glance, these creatures appear to be little more than small jellyfish. However, at the heart of each gelatinous mass is a disturbingly human-looking eyeball floating as if suspended in the creature’s bodily fluids.

Like many of their common jellyfish cousins, the creatures in a swimming eye swarm are incredibly poisonous. Their uncanny eyeballs act as poison sacs as well as a sensory organ. These eyes are remarkably fragile, often bursting after even the gentlest jostling. However, a swarm’s eyeballs grow back quickly, often in less than a week.
