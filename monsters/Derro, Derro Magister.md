  Cytillesh Stare (Ex): Spores of cytillesh fungus in a derro magister's blood grant

    When the cytillesh stare ends, the affected creature automatically forgets all
    that occurred while it was under the stare's effects. This is a mind-affecting
    effect.
  Psychic Incoherence (Su): A derro magister uses its Charisma modifier on Will saves
    instead of its Wisdom modifier. Creatures attempting to read a magister's mind
    must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or take 5d6 points of damage from mental anguish;
    this is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Puppeteer (Su): As a standard action, a derro magister can target one willing creature
    within 30 feet, which can take an immediate action to perform one full turn's
    worth of actions of the magister's choice. Creatures do not obey obviously self-destructive
    orders. While affected, the creature does not suffer from incapacitating effects
    such as stun or paralysis; such effects don't prevent it from taking this immediate
    action.
  Vulnerable to Sunlight (Ex): A derro magister takes 2 points of Constitution damage
    after every hour it's exposed to sunlight
desc_long: Ingesting high doses of the fungus cytillesh imbues derro magisters with
  heightened mental abilities
