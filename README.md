# Pathfinder RPG Obsidian Vault

A vault for *Obsidian MD* with Pathfinder RPG (1st ed) content: classes (only level tables for now), conditions, curses, diseases, feats, items (plus weapons and armor magic abilities), monsters, npcs, poisons, spells and universal monster rules. Might be very helpful for Gamemasters who planned their campaign and Pathfinder games using Obsidian.


## Scripts, raw data and features
- Folder 'zz_scripts' contains scripts on Python which parse and compose MD files. There's a folder 'raw_data' with initial data in .csv and .html formats. Be comfy to use it in any way you want and need.
- Almost all categories of files have YAML pre-header - it can be used with *Dataview* Obsidian plugin. There're automatic generated links inside files (use script 'add_links.py'), so some mistakes in text may occur.
- 'Banned.txt' file contains exluded links (frequently encountered words, like *light*, *fly* etc). You may remove any additional links with 'clean_links.py' script.
- Spell files have a color rating, from the worst to the best - red, orange, blue, green, purple (and black is for unrated spells). It's absolutely subjectively, you may use this color rating system, or change any values as you see it.
