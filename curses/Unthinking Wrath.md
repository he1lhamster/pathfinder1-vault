save: Will 22
onset: 
frequency: 
effect:
  "Each round the victim is in combat, she must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be overcome by a blind fury. This state lasts 1d4+1 rounds, during which time she’s under the effects of a fury similar to barbarian’s rage, although she doesn’t gain the benefits from that class feature, including bonuses to Strength, Constitution, or Will saves, and access to rage powers (even if the afflicted has the ability to rage normally). While in a fury, the afflicted takes a –2 penalty to AC, can’t use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability requiring patience or concentration, and attacks the individual nearest to her. If multiple targets are equally close, the afflicted person attacks randomly each round."
